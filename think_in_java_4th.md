## üçÄ00.1 Comments from readers:
Thinking In Java should be read cover to cover by every Java programmer, then kept close at
hand for frequent reference. The exercises are challenging, and the chapter on Collections is
superb! Not only did this book help me to pass the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam; it's
also the first book I turn to whenever I have a Java question. Jim Pleger, Loudoun
County (Virginia) Government

Much better than any other Java book I've seen. Make that ‚Äúby an order of magnitude‚Äù... 
very complete, with excellent right-to-the-point examples and intelligent, not dumbed-down,
explanations ... In contrast to many other Java books I found it to be unusually mature,
consistent, intellectually honest, well-written and precise. IMHO, an ideal book for studying
Java. Anatoly Vorobey, Technion University, Haifa, Israel

One of the absolutely best programming tutorials I've seen for any language. Joakim
Ziegler, FIX sysop

Thank you for your wonderful, wonderful book on Java. Dr. Gavin Pillay, Registrar, King
Edward VIII Hospital, South Africa

Thank you again for your awesome book. I was really floundering (being a non-C
programmer), but your book has brought me up to speed as fast as I could read it. It's really
cool to be able to understand the underlying principles and concepts from the start, rather
than having to try to build that conceptual model through trial and error. Hopefully I will be
able to attend your seminar in the not-too-distant future. Randall R. Hawley,
Automation Technician, Eli Lilly & Co.

The best computer book writing I have seen. Tom Holland

This is one of the best books I've read about a programming language‚Ä¶ The best book ever
written on Java. Ravindra Pai, Oracle Corporation, SUNOS product line

This is the best book on Java that I have ever found! You have done a great job. Your depth is
amazing. I will be purchasing the book when it is published. I have been learning Java since
October 96. I have read a few books, and consider yours a ‚ÄúMUST READ.‚Äù These past few
months we have been focused on a product written entirely in Java. Your book has helped
solidify topics I was shaky on and has expanded my knowledge base. I have even used some
of your explanations as information in interviewing contractors to help our team. I have
found how much Java knowledge they have by asking them about things I have learned from
reading your book (e.g., the difference between arrays and Vectors). Your book is great!
Steve Wilkinson, Senior Staff Specialist, MCI Telecommunications

Great book. Best book on Java I have seen so far. Jeff Sinclair, Software Engineer,
Kestral Computing

Thank you for Thinking in Java. It's time someone went beyond mere language description
to a thoughtful, penetrating analytic tutorial that doesn't kowtow to The Manufacturers. I've
read almost all the others‚Äîonly yours and Patrick Winston's have found a place in my heart.
I'm already recommending it to customers. Thanks again. Richard Brooks, Java
Consultant, Sun Professional Services, Dallas

Bruce, your book is wonderful! Your explanations are clear and direct. Through your
fantastic book I have gained a tremendous amount of Java knowledge. The exercises are also
FANTASTIC and do an excellent job reinforcing the ideas explained throughout the chapters.
I look forward to reading more books written by you. Thank you for the tremendous service
that you are providing by writing such great books. My code will be much better after reading
Thinking in Java. I thank you and I'm sure any programmers who will have to maintain my
code are also grateful to you. Yvonne Watkins, Java Artisan, Discover Technologies, Inc.

Other books cover the WHAT of Java (describing the syntax and the libraries) or the HOW of
Java (practical programming examples). Thinking in Java is the only book I know that
explains the WHY of Java; why it was designed the way it was, why it works the way it does,
why it sometimes doesn't work, why it's better than C++, why it's not. Although it also 
does a good job of teaching the what and how of the language, Thinking in Java is definitely 
the thinking person's choice in a Java book. Robert S. Stephenson

Thanks for writing a great book. The more I read it the better I like it. My students like it, too.
Chuck Iverson

I just want to commend you for your work on Thinking in Java. It is people like you that
dignify the future of the Internet and I just want to thank you for your effort. It is very much
appreciated. Patrick Barrell, Network Officer Mamco, QAF Mfg. Inc.

I really, really appreciate your enthusiasm and your work. I download every revision of your
online books and am looking into languages and exploring what I would never have dared
(C#, C++, Python, and Ruby, as a side effect). I have at least 15 other Java books (I 
needed 3 to make both JavaScript and PHP viable!) and subscriptions to Dr. Dobbs, JavaPro, JDJ,
JavaWorld, etc., as a result of my pursuit of Java (and Enterprise Java) and certification but I
still keep your book in higher esteem. It truly is a thinking man's book. I subscribe to your
newsletter and hope to one day sit down and solve some of the problems you extend for the
solutions guides for you (I'll buy the guides!) in appreciation. But in the meantime, thanks a
lot. Joshua Long, www.starbuxman.com

Most of the Java books out there are fine for a start, and most just have beginning stuff and 
a lot of the same examples. Yours is by far the best advanced thinking book I've seen. Please
publish it soon! ... I also bought Thinking in C++ just because I was so impressed with
Thinking in Java. George Laframboise, LightWorx Technology Consulting, Inc.

I wrote to you earlier about my favorable impressions regarding your Thinking in C++ (a
book that stands prominently on my shelf here at work). And today I've been able to delve
into Java with your e-book in my virtual hand, and I must say (in my best Chevy Chase from
Modern Problems), ‚ÄúI like it!‚Äù Very informative and explanatory, without reading like a dry
textbook. You cover the most important yet the least covered concepts of Java development:
the whys. Sean Brady

I develop in both Java and C++, and both of your books have been lifesavers for me. If I am
stumped about a particular concept, I know that I can count on your books to a) explain the
thought to me clearly and b) have solid examples that pertain to what I am trying to
accomplish. I have yet to find another author that I continually whole-heartedly recommend
to anyone who is willing to listen. Josh Asbury, A^3 Software Consulting, Cincinnati, Ohio

Your examples are clear and easy to understand. You took care of many important details of
Java that can't be found easily in the weak Java documentation. And you don't waste the
reader's time with the basic facts a programmer already knows. Kai Engert, Innovative
Software, Germany

I'm a great fan of your Thinking in C++ and have recommended it to associates. As I go
through the electronic version of your Java book, I'm finding that you've retained the same
high level of writing. Thank you! Peter R. Neuwald

VERY well-written Java book...I think you've done a GREAT job on it. As the leader of a
Chicagoarea Java special interest group, I've favorably mentioned your book and Web site
several times at our recent meetings. I would like to use Thinking in Java as the basis for a
part of each monthly SIG meeting, in which we review and discuss each chapter in
succession. Mark Ertes

By the way, printed TIJ2 in Russian is still selling great, and remains bestseller. Learning
Java became synonym of reading TIJ2, isn't that nice? Ivan Porty, translator and
publisher of Thinking in Java 2 nd Edition in Russian

I really appreciate your work and your book is good. I recommend it here to our users and
Ph.D. students. Hugues Leroy // Irisa-Inria Rennes France, Head of Scientific
Computing and Industrial Tranfert

OK, I've only read about 40 pages of Thinking in Java, but I've already found it to be the
most clearly written and presented programming book I've come across...and I'm a writer,
myself, so I am probably a little critical. I have Thinking in C++ on order and can't wait to
crack it‚ÄîI'm fairly new to programming and am hitting learning curves head-on everywhere.
So this is just a quick note to say thanks for your excellent work. I had begun to burn a little
low on enthusiasm from slogging through the mucky, murky prose of most computer books‚Äî
even ones that came with glowing recommendations. I feel a whole lot better now. Glenn
Becker, Educational Theatre Association

Thank you for making your wonderful book available. I have found it immensely useful in
finally understanding what I experienced as confusing in Java and C++. Reading your book
has been very satisfying. Felix Bizaoui, Twin Oaks Industries, Louisa, Va.

I must congratulate you on an excellent book. I decided to have a look at Thinking in Java
based on my experience with Thinking in C++, and I was not disappointed. Jaco van der
Merwe, Software Specialist, DataFusion Systems Ltd, Stellenbosch, South Africa
This has to be one of the best Java books I've seen. E.F. Pritchard, Senior Software
Engineer, Cambridge Animation Systems Ltd., United Kingdom

Your book makes all the other Java books I've read or flipped through seem doubly useless
and insulting. Brett Porter, Senior Programmer, Art & Logic

I have been reading your book for a week or two and compared to the books I have read
earlier on Java, your book seems to have given me a great start. I have recommended this
book to a lot of my friends and they have rated it excellent. Please accept my congratulations
for coming out with an excellent book. Rama Krishna Bhupathi, Software Engineer,
TCSI Corporation, San Jose

Just wanted to say what a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù piece of work your book is. I've been using it as a major
reference for in-house Java work. I find that the table of contents is just right for quickly
locating the section that is required. It's also nice to see a book that is not just a rehash of 
the API nor treats the programmer like a dummy. Grant Sayer, Java Components Group
Leader, Ceedata Systems Pty Ltd, Australia

Wow! A readable, in-depth Java book. There are a lot of poor (and admittedly a couple of
good) Java books out there, but from what I've seen yours is definitely one of the best. John
Root, Web Developer, Department of Social Security, London

I've just started Thinking in Java. I expect it to be very good because I really liked Thinking
in C++ (which I read as an experienced C++ programmer, trying to stay ahead of the curve)
‚Ä¶ You are a wonderful author. Kevin K. Lewis, Technologist, ObjectSpace, Inc.

I think it's a great book. I learned all I know about Java from this book. Thank you for
making it available for free over the Internet. If you wouldn't have I'd know nothing about
Java at all. But the best thing is that your book isn't a commercial brochure for Java. It also
shows the bad sides of Java. YOU have done a great job here. Frederik Fix, Belgium

I have been hooked to your books all the time. A couple of years ago, when I wanted to start
with C++, it was C++ Inside & Out which took me around the fascinating world of C++. It
helped me in getting better opportunities in life. Now, in pursuit of more knowledge and
when I wanted to learn Java, I bumped into Thinking in Java‚Äîno doubts in my mind as to
whether I need some other book. Just fantastic. It is more like rediscovering myself as I get
along with the book. It is just a month since I started with Java, and heartfelt thanks to you, I
am understanding it better now. Anand Kumar S., Software Engineer,
Computervision, India

Your book stands out as an excellent general introduction. Peter Robinson, University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory

It's by far the best material I have come across to help me learn Java and I just want you to
know how lucky I feel to have found it. THANKS! Chuck Peterson, Product Leader,
Internet Product Line, IVIS International

The book is great. It's the third book on Java I've started and I'm about two-thirds of the way
through it now. I plan to finish this one. I found out about it because it is used in some
internal classes at Lucent Technologies and a friend told me the book was on the Net. Good
work. Jerry Nowlin, MTS, Lucent Technologies

Of the six or so Java books I've accumulated to date, your Thinking in Java is by far the best
and clearest. Michael Van Waas, Ph.D., President, TMR Associates

I just want to say thanks for Thinking in Java. What a wonderful book you've made here! Not
to mention downloadable for free! As a student I find your books invaluable (I have a copy of
C++ Inside Out, another great book about C++), because they not only teach me the how-to,
but also the whys, which are of course very important in building a strong foundation in
languages such as C++ or Java. I have quite a lot of friends here who love programming just
as I do, and I've told them about your books. They think it's great! Thanks again! By the way,
I'm Indonesian and I live in Java. Ray Frederick Djajadinata, Student at Trisakti
University, Jakarta

The mere fact that you have made this work free over the Net puts me into shock. I thought
I'd let you know how much I appreciate and respect what you're doing. Shane
LeBouthillier, Computer Engineering student, University of Alberta, Canada

I have to tell you how much I look forward to reading your monthly column. As a newbie to
the world of object oriented programming, I appreciate the time and thoughtfulness that you
give to even the most elementary topic. I have downloaded your book, but you can bet that I
will purchase the hard copy when it is published. Thanks for all of your help. Dan Cashmer,
B. C. Ziegler & Co.

Just want to congratulate you on a job well done. First I stumbled upon the PDF version of
Thinking in Java. Even before I finished reading it, I ran to the store and found Thinking in
C++. Now, I have been in the computer business for over eight years, as a consultant,
software engineer, teacher/trainer, and recently as self-employed, so I'd like to think that I
have seen enough (not ‚Äúhave seen it all,‚Äù mind you, but enough). However, these books cause
my girlfriend to call me a ‚Äùgeek.‚Äù Not that I have anything against the concept‚Äîit is just that I
thought this phase was well beyond me. But I find myself truly enjoying both books, like no
other computer book I have touched or bought so far. Excellent writing style, very nice
introduction of every new topic, and lots of wisdom in the books. Well done. Simon
Goland, simonsez@smartt.com, Simon Says Consulting, Inc.

I must say that your Thinking in Java is great! That is exactly the kind of documentation I
was looking for. Especially the sections about good and poor software design using Java.
Dirk Duehr, Lexikon Verlag, Bertelsmann AG, Germany

Thank you for writing two great books (Thinking in C++, Thinking in Java). You have helped
me immensely in my progression to object oriented programming. Donald Lawson, DCL
Enterprises

Thank you for taking the time to write a really helpful book on Java. If teaching makes you
understand something, by now you must be pretty pleased with yourself. Dominic Turner,
GEAC Support

It's the best Java book I have ever read‚Äîand I read some. Jean-Yves MENGANT, Chief
Software Architect NAT-SYSTEM, Paris, France

Thinking in Java gives the best coverage and explanation. Very easy to read, and I mean the
code fragments as well. Ron Chan, Ph.D., Expert Choice, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Your book is great. I have read lots of programming books and your book still adds insights
to programming in my mind. Ningjian Wang, Information System Engineer, The
Vanguard Group

Thinking in Java is an excellent and readable book. I recommend it to all my students. Dr.
Paul Gorman, Department of Computer Science, University of Otago, Dunedin,
New Zealand

With your book, I have now understood what object oriented programming means. ... I
believe that Java is much more straightforward and often even easier than Perl. Torsten
R√∂mer, Orange Denmark

You make it possible for the proverbial free lunch to exist, not just a soup kitchen type of
lunch but a gourmet delight for those who appreciate good software and books about it. Jose
Suriol, Scylax Corporation

Thanks for the opportunity of watching this book grow into a masterpiece! IT IS THE BEST
book on the subject that I've read or browsed. Jeff Lapchinsky, Programmer, Net
Results Technologies

Your book is concise, accessible and a joy to read. Keith Ritchie, Java Research &
Development Team, KL Group Inc.

It truly is the best book I've read on Java! Daniel Eng
The best book I have seen on Java! Rich Hoffarth, Senior Architect, West Group
Thank you for a wonderful book. I'm having a lot of fun going through the chapters. Fred
Trimble, Actium Corporation

You have mastered the art of slowly and successfully making us grasp the details. You make
learning VERY easy and satisfying. Thank you for a truly wonderful tutorial. Rajesh Rau,
Software Consultant

Thinking in Java rocks the free world! Miko O'Sullivan, President, Idocs Inc.

## üçÄ00.2 About Thinking in C++:

Winner of the 1995 Software Development Magazine Jolt Award for Best Book of
the Year

‚ÄúThis book is a tremendous achievement. You owe it to yourself to have a copy on your
shelf. The chapter on iostreams is the most comprehensive and understandable
treatment of that subject I've seen to date.‚Äù
Al Stevens
Contributing Editor, Doctor Dobbs Journal

‚ÄúEckel's book is the only one to so clearly explain how to rethink program construction
for object orientation. That the book is also an excellent tutorial on the ins and outs of
C++ is an added bonus.‚Äù
Andrew Binstock
Editor, Unix Review

‚ÄúBruce continues to amaze me with his insight into C++, and Thinking in C++ is his best
collection of ideas yet. If you want clear answers to difficult questions about C++, buy
this outstanding book.‚Äù
Gary Entsminger
Author, The Tao of Objects

‚ÄúThinking in C++ patiently and methodically explores the issues of when and how to use
inlines, references, operator overloading, inheritance, and dynamic objects, as well as
advanced topics such as the proper use of templates, exceptions and multiple
inheritance. The entire effort is woven in a fabric that includes Eckel's own philosophy of
object and program design. A must for every C++ developer's bookshelf, Thinking in
C++ is the one C++ book you must have if you're doing serious development with C++.‚Äù

# üìú01 Preface
I originally approached Java as ‚Äújust another programming
language,‚Äù which in many senses it is.

But as time passed and I studied it more deeply, I began to see that the fundamental intent of
this language was different from other languages I had seen up to that point.

Programming is about managing complexity: the complexity of the problem you want to
solve, laid upon the complexity of the machine in which it is solved. Because of this
complexity, most of our programming projects fail. And yet, of all the programming
languages of which I am aware, almost none have gone all out and decided that their main
design goal would be to conquer the complexity of developing and maintaining programs. 1 Of
course, many language design decisions were made with complexity in mind, but at some
point there were always other issues that were considered essential to be added into the mix.
Inevitably, those other issues are what cause programmers to eventually ‚Äúhit the wall‚Äù with
that language. For example, C++ had to be backwards-compatible with C (to allow easy
migration for C programmers), as well as efficient. Those are both very useful goals and
account for much of the success of C++, but they also expose extra complexity that prevents
some projects from being finished (certainly, you can blame programmers and management,
but if a language can help by catching your mistakes, why shouldn't it?). As another example,
Visual BASIC (VB) was tied to BASIC, which wasn't really designed to be an extensible
language, so all the extensions piled upon VB have produced some truly unmaintainable
syntax. Perl is backwards-compatible with awk, sed, grep, and other Unix tools it was meant
to replace, and as a result it is often accused of producing ‚Äúwrite-only code‚Äù (that is, after a
while you can't read it). On the other hand, C++, VB, Perl, and other languages like Smalltalk
had some of their design efforts focused on the issue of complexity and as a result are
remarkably successful in solving certain types of problems.

What has impressed me most as I have come to understand Java is that somewhere in the
mix of Sun's design objectives, it seems that there was a goal of reducing complexity for the
programmer. As if to say, ‚ÄúWe care about reducing the time and difficulty of producing
robust code.‚Äù In the early days, this goal resulted in code that didn't run very fast (although
this has improved over time), but it has indeed produced amazing reductions in development
time‚Äîhalf or less of the time that it takes to create an equivalent C++ program. This result
alone can save incredible amounts of time and money, but Java doesn't stop there. It goes on
to wrap many of the complex tasks that have become important, such as multithreading and
network programming, in language features or libraries that can at times make those tasks
easy. And finally, it tackles some really big complexity problems: cross-platform programs,
dynamic code changes, and even security, each of which can fit on your complexity spectrum
anywhere from ‚Äúimpediment‚Äù to ‚Äúshow-stopper.‚Äù So despite the performance problems that
we've seen, the promise of Java is tremendous: It can make us significantly more productive
programmers.

In all ways‚Äîcreating the programs, working in teams, building user interfaces to
communicate with the user, running the programs on different types of machines, and easily
writing programs that communicate across the Internet‚ÄîJava increases the communication
bandwidth between people.

I think that the results of the communication revolution may not be seen from the effects of
moving large quantities of bits around. We shall see the true revolution because we will all
communicate with each other more easily: one-on-one, but also in groups and as a planet.

1 However, I believe that the Python language comes closest to doing exactly that. See www.Python.org.

I've heard it suggested that the next revolution is the formation of a kind of global mind that
results from enough people and enough interconnectedness. Java may or may not be the tool
that foments that revolution, but at least the possibility has made me feel like I'm doing
something meaningful by attempting to teach the language.

## üçÄ01.1 Java SE5 and SE6
This edition of the book benefits greatly from the improvements made to the Java language
in what Sun originally called JDK 1.5, and then later changed to JDK5 or J2SE5, then finally
they dropped the outdated ‚Äú2‚Äù and changed it to Java SE5. Many of the Java SE5 language
changes were designed to improve the experience of the programmer. As you shall see, the
Java language designers did not completely succeed at this task, but in general they made
large steps in the right direction.

One of the important goals of this edition is to completely absorb the improvements of Java
SE5/6, and to introduce and use them throughout this book. This means that this edition
takes the somewhat bold step of being ‚ÄúJava SE5/6-only,‚Äù and much of the code in the book
will not compile with earlier versions of Java; the build system will complain and stop if you
try. However, I think the benefits are worth the risk.

If you are somehow fettered to earlier versions of Java, I have covered the bases by providing
free downloads of previous editions of this book via www.MindView.net. For various
reasons, I have decided not to provide the current edition of the book in free electronic form,
but only the prior editions.

Java SE6
This book was a monumental, time-consuming project, and before it was published, Java
SE6 (code-named mustang) appeared in beta form. Although there were a few minor
changes in Java SE6 that improved some of the examples in the book, for the most part the
focus of Java SE6 did not affect the content of this book; the features were primarily speed
improvements and library features that were outside the purview of this text.
The code in this book was successfully tested with a release candidate of Java SE6, so I do not
expect any changes that will affect the content of this book. If there are any important
changes by the time Java SE6 is officially released, these will be reflected in the book's source
code, which is downloadable from www.MindView.net.

The cover indicates that this book is for ‚ÄúJava SE5/6,‚Äù which means ‚Äúwritten for Java SE5
and the very significant changes that version introduced into the language, but is equally
applicable to Java SE6.‚Äù

## üçÄ01.2 The 4 th edition
The satisfaction of doing a new edition of a book is in getting things ‚Äúright,‚Äù according to
what I have learned since the last edition came out. Often these insights are in the nature of
the saying ‚ÄúA learning experience is what you get when you don't get what you want,‚Äù and my
opportunity is to fix something embarrassing or simply tedious. Just as often, creating the
next edition produces fascinating new ideas, and the embarrassment is far outweighed by the
delight of discovery and the ability to express ideas in a better form than what I have
previously achieved.

There is also the challenge that whispers in the back of my brain, that of making the book
something that owners of previous editions will want to buy. This presses me to improve,
rewrite and reorganize everything that I can, to make the book a new and valuable experience
for dedicated readers.

Changes
The CD-ROM that has traditionally been packaged as part of this book is not part of this
edition. The essential part of that CD, the Thinking in C multimedia seminar (created for
MindView by Chuck Allison), is now available as a downloadable Flash presentation. The
goal of that seminar is to prepare those who are not familiar enough with C syntax to
understand the material presented in this book. Although two of the chapters in this book
give decent introductory syntax coverage, they may not be enough for people without an
adequate background, and Thinking in C is intended to help those people get to the necessary
level.

The Concurrency chapter (formerly called ‚ÄúMultithreading‚Äù) has been completely rewritten
to match the major changes in the Java SE5 concurrency libraries, but it still gives you a basic
foundation in the core ideas of concurrency. Without that core, it's hard to understand more
complex issues of threading. I spent many months working on this, immersed in that
netherworld called ‚Äúconcurrency,‚Äù and in the end the chapter is something that not only
provides a basic foundation but also ventures into more advanced territory.
There is a new chapter on every significant new Java SE5 language feature, and the other new
features have been woven into modifications made to the existing material. Because of my
continuing study of design patterns, more patterns have been introduced throughout the
book as well.

The book has undergone significant reorganization. Much of this has come from the teaching
process together with a realization that, perhaps, my perception of what a ‚Äúchapter‚Äù was
could stand some rethought. I have tended towards an unconsidered belief that a topic had to
be ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù to justify being a chapter. But especially while teaching design patterns, I
find that seminar attendees do best if I introduce a single pattern and then we immediately
do an exercise, even if it means I only speak for a brief time (I discovered that this pace was
also more enjoyable for me as a teacher). So in this version of the book I've tried to break
chapters up by topic, and not worry about the resulting length of the chapters. I think it has
been an improvement.

I have also come to realize the importance of code testing. Without a built-in test framework
with tests that are run every time you do a build of your system, you have no way of knowing
if your code is reliable or not. To accomplish this in the book, I created a test framework to
display and validate the output of each program. (The framework was written in Python; you
can find it in the downloadable code for this book at www.MindView.net.) Testing in general
is covered in the supplement you will find at http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava, which
introduces what I now believe are fundamental skills that all programmers should have in
their basic toolkit.

In addition, I've gone over every single example in the book and asked myself, ‚ÄúWhy did I do
it this way?‚Äù In most cases I have done some modification and improvement, both to make
the examples more consistent within themselves and also to demonstrate what I consider to
be best practices in Java coding (at least, within the limitations of an introductory text).
Many of the existing examples have had very significant redesign and reimplementation.
Examples that no longer made sense to me were removed, and new examples have been
added.

Readers have made many, many wonderful comments about the first three editions of this
book, which has naturally been very pleasant for me. However, every now and then, someone
will have complaints, and for some reason one complaint that comes up periodically is ‚ÄúThe
book is too big.‚Äù In my mind it is faint damnation indeed if ‚Äútoo many pages‚Äù is your only

gripe. (One is reminded of the Emperor of Austria's complaint about Mozart's work: ‚ÄúToo
many notes!‚Äù Not that I am in any way trying to compare myself to Mozart.) In addition, I
can only assume that such a complaint comes from someone who is yet to be acquainted with
the vastness of the Java language itself and has not seen the rest of the books on the subject.
Despite this, one of the things I have attempted to do in this edition is trim out the portions
that have become obsolete, or at least nonessential. In general, I've tried to go over
everything, remove what is no longer necessary, include changes, and improve everything I
could. I feel comfortable removing portions because the original material remains on the
Web site (www.MindView.net), in the form of the freely downloadable 1 st through 3 rd
editions of the book, and in the downloadable supplements for this book.

For those of you who still can't stand the size of the book, I do apologize. Believe it or not, I
have worked hard to keep the size down.

Note on the cover design
The cover of Thinking in Java is inspired by the American Arts & Crafts Movement that
began near the turn of the century and reached its zenith between 1900 and 1920. It began in
England as a reaction to both the machine production of the Industrial Revolution and the
highly ornamental style of the Victorian era. Arts & Crafts emphasized spare design, the
forms of nature as seen in the art nouveau movement, hand-crafting, and the importance of
the individual craftsperson, and yet it did not eschew the use of modern tools. There are
many echoes with the situation we have today: the turn of the century, the evolution from the
raw beginnings of the computer revolution to something more refined and meaningful, and
the emphasis on software craftsmanship rather than just manufacturing code.

I see Java in this same way: as an attempt to elevate the programmer away from an operating
system mechanic and toward being a ‚Äúsoftware craftsman.‚Äù

Both the author and the book/cover designer (who have been friends since childhood) find
inspiration in this movement, and both own furniture, lamps, and other pieces that are either
original or inspired by this period.

The other theme in this cover suggests a collection box that a naturalist might use to display
the insect specimens that he or she has preserved. These insects are objects that are placed
within the box objects. The box objects are themselves placed within the ‚Äúcover object,‚Äù
which illustrates the fundamental concept of aggregation in object-oriented programming. Of
course, a programmer cannot help but make the association with ‚Äúbugs,‚Äù and here the bugs
have been captured and presumably killed in a specimen jar, and finally confined within a
small display box, as if to imply Java's ability to find, display, and subdue bugs (which is truly
one of its most powerful attributes).

In this edition, I created the watercolor painting that you see as the cover background.

## üçÄ01.3 Acknowledgements
First, thanks to associates who have worked with me to give seminars, provide consulting,
and develop teaching projects: Dave Bartlett, Bill Venners, Chuck Allison, Jeremy Meyer, and
Jamie King. I appreciate your patience as I continue to try to develop the best model for
independent folks like us to work together.

Recently, no doubt because of the Internet, I have become associated with a surprisingly
large number of people who assist me in my endeavors, usually working from their own
home offices. In the past, I would have had to pay for a pretty big office space to
accommodate all these folks, but because of the Net, FedEx, and the telephone, I'm able to
benefit from their help without the extra costs. In my attempts to learn to ‚Äúplay well with
others,‚Äù you have all been very helpful, and I hope to continue learning how to make my own
work better through the efforts of others. Paula Steuer has been invaluable in taking over my
haphazard business practices and making them sane (thanks for prodding me when I don't
want to do something, Paula). Jonathan Wilcox, Esq., has sifted through my corporate
structure and turned over every possible rock that might hide scorpions, and frog-marched
us through the process of putting everything straight, legally. Thanks for your care and
persistence. Sharlynn Cobaugh has made herself an expert in sound processing and an
essential part of creating the multimedia training experiences, as well as tackling other
problems. Thanks for your perseverance when faced with intractable computer problems.

The folks at Amaio in Prague have helped me out with several projects. Daniel Will-Harris
was the original work-by-Internet inspiration, and he is of course fundamental to all my
graphic design solutions.

Over the years, through his conferences and workshops, Gerald Weinberg has become my
unofficial coach and mentor, for which I thank him.

Ervin Varga was exceptionally helpful with technical corrections on the 4 th edition‚Äîalthough
other people helped on various chapters and examples, Ervin was my primary technical
reviewer for the book, and he also took on the task of rewriting the solution guide for the 4 th
edition. Ervin found errors and made improvements to the book that were invaluable
additions to this text. His thoroughness and attention to detail are amazing, and he's far and
away the best technical reader I've ever had. Thanks, Ervin.

My weblog on Bill Venners' www.Artima.com has been a source of assistance when I've
needed to bounce ideas around. Thanks to the readers that have helped me clarify concepts
by submitting comments, including James Watson, Howard Lovatt, Michael Barker, and
others, in particular those who helped with generics.

Thanks to Mark Welsh for his continuing assistance.

Evan Cofsky continues to be very supportive by knowing off the top of his head all the arcane
details of setting up and maintaining Linux-based Web servers, and keeping the MindView
server tuned and secure.

A special thanks to my new friend, coffee, who generated nearly boundless enthusiasm for
this project. Camp4 Coffee in Crested Butte, Colorado, has become the standard hangout
when people have come up to take MindView seminars, and during seminar breaks it is the
best catering I've ever had. Thanks to my buddy Al Smith for creating it and making it such a
great place, and for being such an interesting and entertaining part of the Crested Butte
experience. And to all the Camp4 barristas who so cheerfully dole out beverages.

Thanks to the folks at Prentice Hall for continuing to give me what I want, putting up with all
my special requirements, and for going out of their way to make things run smoothly for me.
Certain tools have proved invaluable during my development process and I am very grateful
to the creators every time I use these. Cygwin (www.cygwin.com) has solved innumerable
problems for me that Windows can't/won't and I become more attached to it each day (if I
only had this 15 years ago when my brain was still hard-wired with Gnu Emacs). IBM's
Eclipse (www.eclipse.org) is a truly wonderful contribution to the development community,
and I expect
to see great things from it as it continues to evolve (how did IBM become hip? I must have
missed a memo). JetBrains IntelliJ Idea continues to forge creative new paths in
development tools.

I began using Enterprise Architect from Sparxsystems on this book, and it has rapidly
become my UML tool of choice. Marco Hunsicker's Jalopy code formatter
(www.triemax.com) came in handy on numerous occasions, and Marco was very helpful in

configuring it to my particular needs. I've also found Slava Pestov's JEdit and plug-ins to be
helpful at times (www.jedit.org) and it's quite a reasonable beginner's editor for seminars.

And of course, if I don't say it enough everywhere else, I use Python (www.Python.org)
constantly to solve problems, the brainchild of my buddy Guido Van Rossum and the gang of
goofy geniuses with whom I spent a few great days sprinting (Tim Peters, I've now framed
that mouse you borrowed, officially named the ‚ÄúTimBotMouse‚Äù). You guys need to find
healthier places to eat lunch. (Also, thanks to the entire Python community, an amazing
bunch of people.)

Lots of people sent in corrections and I am indebted to them all, but particular thanks go to
(for the 1 st edition): Kevin Raulerson (found tons of great bugs), Bob Resendes (simply
incredible), John Pinto, Joe Dante, Joe Sharp (all three were fabulous), David Combs (many
grammar and clarification corrections), Dr. Robert Stephenson, John Cook, Franklin Chen,
Zev Griner, David Karr, Leander A. Stroschein, Steve Clark, Charles A. Lee, Austin Maher,
Dennis P. Roth, Roque Oliveira, Douglas Dunn, Dejan Ristic, Neil Galarneau, David B.

Malkovsky, Steve Wilkinson, and a host of others. Prof. Ir. Marc Meurrens put in a great deal
of effort to publicize and make the electronic version of the 1 st edition of the book available in
Europe.

Thanks to those who helped me rewrite the examples to use the Swing library (for the 2 nd
edition), and for other assistance: Jon Shvarts, Thomas Kirsch, Rahim Adatia, Rajesh Jain,
Ravi Manthena, Banu Rajamani, Jens Brandt, Nitin Shivaram, Malcolm Davis, and everyone
who expressed support.

In the 4 th edition, Chris Grindstaff was very helpful during the development of the SWT
section, and Sean Neville wrote the first draft of the Flex section for me.

Kraig Brockschmidt and Gen Kiyooka have been some of the smart technical people in my
life who have become friends and have also been both influential and unusual in that they do
yoga and practice other forms of spiritual enhancement, which I find quite inspirational and
instructional.

It's not that much of a surprise to me that understanding Delphi helped me understand Java,
since there are many concepts and language design decisions in common. My Delphi friends
provided assistance by helping me gain insight into that marvelous programming
environment. They are Marco Cantu (another Italian‚Äîperhaps being steeped in Latin gives
one aptitude for programming languages?), Neil Rubenking (who used to do the
yoga/vegetarian/Zen thing until he discovered computers), and of course Zack Urlocker (the
original Delphi product manager), a long-time pal whom I've traveled the world with. We're
all indebted to the brilliance of Anders Hejlsberg, who continues to toil away at C# (which, as
you'll learn in this book, was a major inspiration for Java SE5).

My friend Richard Hale Shaw's insights and support have been very helpful (and Kim's, too).
Richard and I spent many months giving seminars together and trying to work out the
perfect learning experience for the attendees.

The book design, cover design, and cover photo were created by my friend Daniel Will-
Harris, noted author and designer (www.Will-Harris.com), who used to play with rub-on
letters in
junior high school while he awaited the invention of computers and desktop publishing, and
complained of me mumbling over my algebra problems. However, I produced the camera-
ready pages myself, so the typesetting errors are mine. Microsoft ¬Æ Word XP for Windows
was used to write the book and to create camera-ready pages in Adobe Acrobat; the book was
created directly from the Acrobat PDF files. As a tribute to the electronic age, I happened to
be overseas when I produced the final versions of the 1 st and 2 nd editions of the book‚Äîthe 1 st
edition was sent from Cape Town, South Africa, and the 2 nd edition was posted from Prague.

The 3 rd and 4 th came from Crested Butte, Colorado. The body typeface is Georgia and the
headlines are in Verdana. The cover typeface is ITC Rennie Mackintosh.

A special thanks to all my teachers and all my students (who are my teachers as well).

# üìú02 Introduction
‚ÄúHe gave man speech, and speech created thought, Which is the
measure of the Universe‚Äù‚ÄîPrometheus Unbound, Shelley

Human beings ... are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has
become the medium of expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine
that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that language
is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication and
reflection. The fact of the matter is that the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù is to a large extent
unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group.

The Status of Linguistics as a Science, 1929, Edward Sapir
Like any human language, Java provides a way to express concepts. If successful, this
medium of expression will be significantly easier and more flexible than the alternatives as
problems grow larger and more complex.

You can't look at Java as just a collection of features‚Äîsome of the features make no sense in
isolation. You can use the sum of the parts only if you are thinking about design, not simply
coding. And to understand Java in this way, you must understand the problems with the
language and with programming in general. This book discusses programming problems,
why they are problems, and the approach Java has taken to solve them. Thus, the set of
features that I explain in each chapter are based on the way I see a particular type of problem
being solved with the language. In this way I hope to move you, a little at a time, to the point
where the Java mindset becomes your native tongue.

Throughout, I'll be taking the attitude that you want to build a model in your head that allows
you to develop a deep understanding of the language; if you encounter a puzzle, you'll feed it
to your model and deduce the answer.

## üçÄ02.01 Prerequisites
This book assumes that you have some programming familiarity: You understand that a
program is a collection of statements, the idea of a subroutine/function/macro, control
statements such as ‚Äúif‚Äù and looping constructs such as ‚Äúwhile,‚Äù etc. However, you might have
learned this in many places, such as programming with a macro language or working with a
tool like Perl. As long as you've programmed to the point where you feel comfortable with the
basic ideas of programming, you'll be able to work through this book. Of course, the book will
be easier for C programmers and more so for C++ programmers, but don't count yourself out
if you're not experienced with those languages‚Äîhowever, come willing to work hard. Also,
the Thinking in C multimedia seminar that you can download from www.MindView.net will
bring you up to speed in the fundamentals necessary to learn Java. However, I will be
introducing the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and Java's basic control
mechanisms.

Although references may be made to C and C++ language features, these are not intended to
be insider comments, but instead to help all programmers put Java in perspective with those
languages, from which, after all, Java is descended. I will attempt to make these references
simple and to explain anything that I think a non-C/C++ programmer would not be familiar
with.

## üçÄ02.02 Learning Java
At about the same time that my first book, Using C++ (Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1989), came
out, I began teaching that language. Teaching programming ideas has become my profession;
I've seen nodding heads, blank faces, and puzzled expressions in audiences all over the world
since 1987. As I began giving in-house training with smaller groups of people, I discovered
something during the exercises. Even those people who were smiling and nodding were
confused about many issues. I found out, by creating and chairing the C++ track at the
Software Development Conference for a number of years (and later creating and chairing the
Java track), that I and other speakers tended to give the typical audience too many topics too
quickly. So eventually, through both variety in the audience level and the way that I
presented the material, I would end up losing some portion of the audience. Maybe it's
asking too much, but because I am one of those people resistant to traditional lecturing (and
for most people, I believe, such resistance results from boredom), I wanted to try to keep
everyone up to speed.

For a time, I was creating a number of different presentations in fairly short order. Thus, I
ended up learning by experiment and iteration (a technique that also works well in program
design). Eventually, I developed a course using everything I had learned from my teaching
experience. My company, MindView, Inc., now gives this as the public and in-house Thinking
in Java seminar; this is our main introductory seminar that provides the foundation for our
more advanced seminars. You can find details at www.MindView.net. (The introductory
seminar is also available as the Hands-On Java CD ROM. Information is available at the
same Web site.)

The feedback that I get from each seminar helps me change and refocus the material until I
think it works well as a teaching medium. But this book isn't just seminar notes; I tried to
pack as much information as I could within these pages, and structured it to draw you
through into the next subject. More than anything, the book is designed to serve the solitary
reader who is struggling with a new programming language.

## üçÄ02.03 Goals
Like my previous book, Thinking in C++, this book was designed with one thing in mind: the
way people learn a language. When I think of a chapter in the book, I think in terms of what
makes a good lesson during a seminar. Seminar audience feedback helped me understand the
difficult parts that needed illumination. In the areas where I got ambitious and included too
many features all at once, I came to know‚Äîthrough the process of presenting the material‚Äî
that if you include a lot of new features, you need to explain them all, and this easily
compounds the student's confusion.

Each chapter tries to teach a single feature, or a small group of associated features, without
relying on concepts that haven't been introduced yet. That way you can digest each piece in
the context of your current knowledge before moving on.

My goals in this book are to:
1. Present the material one simple step at a time so that you can easily digest each idea
before moving on. Carefully sequence the presentation of features so that you're
exposed to a topic before you see it in use. Of course, this isn't always possible; in
those situations, a brief introductory description is given.

2. Use examples that are as simple and short as possible. This sometimes prevents me
from tackling ‚Äúreal world‚Äù problems, but I've found that beginners are usually happier
when they can understand every detail of an example rather than being impressed by
the scope of the problem it solves. Also, there's a severe limit to the amount of code
that can be absorbed in a classroom situation. For this I will no doubt receive criticism
for using ‚Äútoy examples,‚Äù but I'm willing to accept that in favor of producing
something pedagogically useful.

3. Give you what I think is important for you to understand about the language, rather
than everything that I know. I believe there is an information importance hierarchy,
and that there are some facts that 95 percent of programmers will never need to
know‚Äîdetails that just confuse people and increase their perception of the complexity
of the language. To take an example from C, if you memorize the operator precedence
table (I never did), you can write clever code. But if you need to think about it, it will
also confuse the reader/maintainer of that code. So forget about precedence, and use
parentheses when things aren't clear.

4. Keep each section focused enough so that the lecture time‚Äîand the time between
exercise periods‚Äîis small. Not only does this keep the audience's minds more active
and involved during a hands-on seminar, but it gives the reader a greater sense of
accomplishment.

5. Provide you with a solid foundation so that you can understand the issues well enough
to move on to more difficult coursework and books.

## üçÄ02.04 Teaching from this book
The original edition of this book evolved from a one-week seminar which was, when Java was
in its infancy, enough time to cover the language. As Java grew and continued to encompass
more and more features and libraries, I stubbornly tried to teach it all in one week. At one
point, a customer asked me to teach ‚Äújust the fundamentals,‚Äù and in doing so I discovered
that trying to cram everything into a single week had become painful for both myself and for
seminarians. Java was no longer a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù language that could be taught in a week.

That experience and realization drove much of the reorganization of this book, which is now
designed to support a two-week seminar or a two-term college course. The introductory
portion ends with the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter, but you may also want to
supplement this with an introduction to JDBC, Servlets and JSPs. This provides a foundation
course, and is the core of the Hands-On Java CD ROM. The remainder of the book comprises
an intermediatelevel course, and is the material covered in the Intermediate Thinking in

Java CD ROM. Both of these CD ROMs are for sale at www.MindView.net.
Contact Prentice-Hall at www.prenhallprofessional.com for information about professor
support materials for this book.

## üçÄ02.05 JDK HTML documentation
The Java language and libraries from Sun Microsystems (a free download from
http://java.sun.com) come with documentation in electronic form, readable using a Web
browser. Many books published on Java have duplicated this documentation. So you either
already have it or you can download it, and unless necessary, this book will not repeat that
documentation, because it's usually much faster if you find the class descriptions with your
Web browser than if you look them up in a book (and the online documentation is probably
more upto-date). You'll simply be referred to ‚Äúthe JDK documentation.‚Äù This book will
provide extra descriptions of the classes only when it's necessary to supplement that
documentation so you can understand a particular example.

## üçÄ02.06 Exercises
I've discovered that simple exercises are exceptionally useful to complete a student's
understanding during a seminar, so you'll find a set at the end of each chapter.
Most exercises are designed to be easy enough that they can be finished in a reasonable
amount of time in a classroom situation while the instructor observes, making sure that all
the students are absorbing the material. Some are more challenging, but none present major
challenges.

Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java
Annotated Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ02.07 Foundations for Java
Another bonus with this edition is the free multimedia seminar that you can download from
www.MindView.net. This is the Thinking in C seminar that gives you an introduction to the
C syntax, operators, and functions that Java syntax is based upon. In previous editions of the
book this was in the Foundations for Java CD that was packaged with the book, but now the
seminar may be freely downloaded.

I originally commissioned Chuck Allison to create Thinking in C as a standalone product, but
decided to include it with the 2 nd edition of Thinking in C++ and 2 nd and 3 rd editions of
Thinking in Java because of the consistent experience of having people come to seminars
without an adequate background in basic C syntax. The thinking apparently goes ‚ÄúI'm a
smart programmer and I don't want to learn C, but rather C++ or Java, so I'll just skip C and
go directly to C++/Java.‚Äù After arriving at the seminar, it slowly dawns on folks that the
prerequisite of understanding C syntax is there for a very good reason.

Technologies have changed, and it made more sense to rework Thinking in C as a
downloadable Flash presentation rather than including it as a CD. By providing this seminar
online, I can ensure that everyone can begin with adequate preparation.

The Thinking in C seminar also allows the book to appeal to a wider audience. Even though
the Operators and Controlling Execution chapters do cover the fundamental parts of Java
that come from C, the online seminar is a gentler introduction, and assumes even less about
the student's programming background than does the book.

## üçÄ02.09 Coding standards
In the text of this book, identifiers (methods, variables, and class names) are set in bold.
Most keywords are also set in bold, except for those keywords that are used so much that the
bolding can become tedious, such as ‚Äúclass.‚Äù

I use a particular coding style for the examples in this book. As much as possible, this follows
the style that Sun itself uses in virtually all of the code you will find at its site (see
http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/index.html), and seems to be supported by most Java
development environments. If you've read my other works, you'll also notice that Sun's
coding style coincides with mine‚Äîthis pleases me, although I had nothing (that I know of) to
do with it. The subject of formatting style is good for hours of hot debate, so I'll just say I'm
not trying to dictate correct style via my examples; I have my own motivation for using the
style that I do. Because Java is a free-form programming language, you can continue to use
whatever style you're comfortable with. One solution to the coding style issue is to use a tool
like Jalopy (www.triemax.com), which assisted me in developing this book, to change
formatting to that which suits you.

The code files printed in the book are tested with an automated system, and should all work
without compiler errors.

This book focuses on and is tested with Java SE5/6. If you need to learn about earlier
releases of the language that are not covered in this edition, the 1 st through 3 rd editions 
of the book are freely downloadable at www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ02.10 Errors
No matter how many tools a writer uses to detect errors, some always creep in and these
often leap off the page for a fresh reader. If you discover anything you believe to be an error,
please use the link you will find for this book at www.MindView.net to submit the error
along with your suggested correction. Your help is appreciated.

# üìú 03. Introduction to Objects
‚ÄúWe cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances
as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement that holds
throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of
our language ‚Ä¶ we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the
organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.‚Äù
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941)

The genesis of the computer revolution was in a machine. The genesis of our programming
languages thus tends to look like that machine.

But computers are not so much machines as they are mind amplification tools (‚Äúbicycles for
the mind,‚Äù as Steve Jobs is fond of saying) and a different kind of expressive medium. As a
result, the tools are beginning to look less like machines and more like parts of our minds,
and also like other forms of expression such as writing, painting, sculpture, animation, and
filmmaking. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is part of this movement toward using the
computer as an expressive medium.

This chapter will introduce you to the basic concepts of OOP, including an overview of
development methods. This chapter, and this book, assumes that you have some
programming experience, although not necessarily in C. If you think you need more
preparation in programming before tackling this book, you should work through the
Thinking in C multimedia seminar, downloadable from www.MindView.net.

This chapter is background and supplementary material. Many people do not feel
comfortable wading into object-oriented programming without understanding the big picture
first. Thus, there are many concepts that are introduced here to give you a solid overview of
OOP. However, other people may not get the big picture concepts until they've seen some of
the mechanics first; these people may become bogged down and lost without some code to
get their hands on. If you're part of this latter group and are eager to get to the specifics 
of the language, feel free to jump past this chapter‚Äîskipping it at this point will not prevent 
you from writing programs or learning the language. However, you will want to come back here
eventually to fill in your knowledge so you can understand why objects are important and
how to design with them.

## üçÄ03.01 The progress of abstraction
All programming languages provide abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the
problems you're able to solve is directly related to the kind and quality of abstraction. By
‚Äúkind‚Äù I mean, ‚ÄúWhat is it that you are abstracting?‚Äù Assembly language is a small abstraction
of the underlying machine. Many so-called ‚Äúimperative‚Äù languages that followed (such as
FORTRAN, BASIC, and C) were abstractions of assembly language. These languages are big
improvements over assembly language, but their primary abstraction still requires you to
think in terms of the structure of the computer rather than the structure of the problem you
are trying to solve. The programmer must establish the association between the machine
model (in the ‚Äúsolution space,‚Äù which is the place where you're implementing that solution,
such as a computer) and the model of the problem that is actually being solved (in the
‚Äúproblem space,‚Äù which is the place where the problem exists, such as a business). The effort
required to perform this mapping, and the fact that it is extrinsic to the programming
language, produces programs that are difficult to write and expensive to maintain, and as a
side effect created the entire ‚Äúprogramming methods‚Äù industry.

The alternative to modeling the machine is to model the problem you're trying to solve. Early
languages such as LISP and APL chose particular views of the world (‚ÄúAll problems are
ultimately lists‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll problems are algorithmic,‚Äù respectively). Prolog casts all problems
into chains of decisions. Languages have been created for constraint-based programming and
for programming exclusively by manipulating graphical symbols. (The latter proved to be too
restrictive.) Each of these approaches may be a good solution to the particular class of
problem they're designed to solve, but when you step outside of that domain they become
awkward.

The object-oriented approach goes a step further by providing tools for the programmer to
represent elements in the problem space. This representation is general enough that the
programmer is not constrained to any particular type of problem. We refer to the elements in
the problem space and their representations in the solution space as ‚Äúobjects.‚Äù (You will also
need other objects that don't have problem-space analogs.) The idea is that the program is
allowed to adapt itself to the lingo of the problem by adding new types of objects, so when
you read the code describing the solution, you're reading words that also express the
problem. This is a more flexible and powerful language abstraction than what we've had
before. ¬π Thus, OOP allows you to describe the problem in terms of the problem, rather than
in terms of the computer where the solution will run. There's still a connection back to the
computer: Each object looks quite a bit like a little computer‚Äîit has a state, and it has
operations that you can ask it to perform. However, this doesn't seem like such a bad analogy
to objects in the real world‚Äîthey all have characteristics and behaviors.

¬π Some language designers have decided that object-oriented programming by itself is not
adequate to easily solve all programming problems, and advocate the combination of various 
approaches into multiparadigm programming languages. See Multiparadigm Programming in Leda 
by Timothy Budd (Addison-Wesley, 1995).

Alan Kay summarized five basic characteristics of Smalltalk, the first successful object-
oriented language and one of the languages upon which Java is based. These characteristics
represent a pure approach to object-oriented programming:
1. Everything is an object. Think of an object as a fancy variable; it stores data,
but you can ‚Äúmake requests‚Äù to that object, asking it to perform operations on itself. In
theory, you can take any conceptual component in the problem you're trying to solve
(dogs, buildings, services, etc.) and represent it as an object in your program.

2. A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by
sending messages. To make a request of an object, you ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù to that
object. More concretely, you can think of a message as a request to call a method that
belongs to a particular object.

3. Each object has its own memory made up of other objects. Put
another way, you create a new kind of object by making a package containing existing
objects. Thus, you can build complexity into a program while hiding it behind the
simplicity of objects.

4. Every object has a type. Using the parlance, each object is an instance of a
class, in which ‚Äúclass‚Äù is synonymous with ‚Äútype.‚Äù The most important distinguishing
characteristic of a class is ‚ÄúWhat messages can you send to it?‚Äù

5. All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages. This
is actually a loaded statement, as you will see later. Because an object of type ‚Äúcircle‚Äù is
also an object of type ‚Äúshape,‚Äù a circle is guaranteed to accept shape messages. This

means you can write code that talks to shapes and automatically handle anything that
fits the description of a shape. This substitutability is one of the powerful concepts in
OOP.

Booch offers an even more succinct description of an object:

    An object has state, behavior and identity.

This means that an object can have internal data (which gives it state), methods (to produce
behavior), and each object can be uniquely distinguished from every other object‚Äîto put this
in a concrete sense, each object has a unique address in memory. ¬≤

¬≤ This is actually a bit restrictive, since objects can conceivably exist in different machines 
and address spaces, and they can also be stored on disk. In these cases, the identity of 
the object must be determined by something other than memory address.

## üçÄ03.02 An object has an interface
Aristotle was probably the first to begin a careful study of the concept of type; he spoke of
‚Äúthe class of fishes and the class of birds.‚Äù The idea that all objects, while being unique, are
also part of a class of objects that have characteristics and behaviors in common was used
directly in the first object-oriented language, Simula-67, with its fundamental keyword class
that introduces a new type into a program.

Simula, as its name implies, was created for developing simulations such as the classic ‚Äúbank
teller problem.‚Äù In this, you have numerous tellers, customers, accounts, transactions, and
units of money‚Äîa lot of ‚Äúobjects.‚Äù Objects that are identical except for their state during a
program's execution are grouped together into ‚Äúclasses of objects,‚Äù and that's where the
keyword class came from. Creating abstract data types (classes) is a fundamental concept in
object-oriented programming. Abstract data types work almost exactly like built-in types:
You can create variables of a type (called objects or instances in object-oriented parlance)
and manipulate those variables (called sending messages or requests; you send a message
and the object figures out what to do with it). The members (elements) of each class share
some commonality: Every account has a balance, every teller can accept a deposit, etc. At the
same time, each member has its own state: Each account has a different balance, each teller
has a name. Thus, the tellers, customers, accounts, transactions, etc., can each be
represented with a unique entity in the computer program. This entity is the object, and each
object belongs to a particular class that defines its characteristics and behaviors.

So, although what we really do in object-oriented programming is create new data types,
virtually all object-oriented programming languages use the ‚Äúclass‚Äù keyword. When you see
the word ‚Äútype‚Äù think ‚Äúclass‚Äù and vice versa. ¬≥

¬≥ Some people make a distinction, stating that type determines the interface while class is 
a particular implementation of that interface.

Since a class describes a set of objects that have identical characteristics (data elements) and
behaviors (functionality), a class is really a data type because a floating point number, for
example, also has a set of characteristics and behaviors. The difference is that a programmer
defines a class to fit a problem rather than being forced to use an existing data type that was
designed to represent a unit of storage in a machine. You extend the programming language
by adding new data types specific to your needs. The programming system welcomes the new
classes and gives them all the care and type checking that it gives to built-in types.

The object-oriented approach is not limited to building simulations. Whether or not you
agree that any program is a simulation of the system you're designing, the use of OOP
techniques can easily reduce a large set of problems to a simple solution.

Once a class is established, you can make as many objects of that class as you like, and then
manipulate those objects as if they are the elements that exist in the problem you are trying
to solve. Indeed, one of the challenges of object-oriented programming is to create a one-to-
one mapping between the elements in the problem space and objects in the solution space.

But how do you get an object to do useful work for you? There needs to be a way to make a
request of the object so that it will do something, such as complete a transaction, draw
something on the screen, or turn on a switch. And each object can satisfy only certain
requests. The requests you can make of an object are defined by its interface, and the type is
what determines the interface. A simple example might be a representation of a light bulb:

    Light lt = new Light();
    lt.on();

The interface determines the requests that you can make for a particular object. However,
there must be code somewhere to satisfy that request. This, along with the hidden data,
comprises the implementation. From a procedural programming standpoint, it's not that
complicated. A type has a method associated with each possible request, and when you make
a particular request to an object, that method is called. This process is usually summarized by
saying that you ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù (make a request) to an object, and the object figures out
what to do with that message (it executes code).

Here, the name of the type/class is Light, the name of this particular Light object is lt, and
the requests that you can make of a Light object are to turn it on, turn it off, make it
brighter, or make it dimmer. You create a Light object by defining a ‚Äúreference‚Äù (lt) for that
object and calling new to request a new object of that type. To send a message to the object,
you state the name of the object and connect it to the message request with a period (dot).
From the standpoint of the user of a predefined class, that's pretty much all there is to
programming with objects.

The preceding diagram follows the format of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Each
class is represented by a box, with the type name in the top portion of the box, any data
members that you care to describe in the middle portion of the box, and the methods (the
functions that belong to this object, which receive any messages you send to that object) in
the bottom portion of the box. Often, only the name of the class and the public methods are
shown in UML design diagrams, so the middle portion is not shown, as in this case. If you're
interested only in the class name, then the bottom portion doesn't need to be shown, either.

## üçÄ03.03 An object provides services
While you're trying to develop or understand a program design, one of the best ways to think
about objects is as ‚Äúservice providers.‚Äù Your program itself will provide services to the user,
and it will accomplish this by using the services offered by other objects. Your goal is to
produce (or even better, locate in existing code libraries) a set of objects that provide the
ideal services to solve your problem.

A way to start doing this is to ask, ‚ÄúIf I could magically pull them out of a hat, what objects
would solve my problem right away?‚Äù For example, suppose you are creating a bookkeeping
program. You might imagine some objects that contain pre-defined bookkeeping input
screens, another set of objects that perform bookkeeping calculations, and an object that
handles printing of checks and invoices on all different kinds of printers. Maybe some of
these objects already exist, and for the ones that don't, what would they look like? What
services would those objects provide, and what objects would they need to fulfill their
obligations? If you keep doing this, you will eventually reach a point where you can say
either, ‚ÄúThat object seems simple enough to sit down and write‚Äù or ‚ÄúI'm sure that object 
must exist already.‚Äù This is a reasonable way to decompose a problem into a set of objects.

Thinking of an object as a service provider has an additional benefit: It helps to improve the
cohesiveness of the object. High cohesion is a fundamental quality of software design: It
means that the various aspects of a software component (such as an object, although this
could also apply to a method or a library of objects) ‚Äúfit together‚Äù well. One problem people
have when designing objects is cramming too much functionality into one object. For
example, in your check printing module, you may decide you need an object that knows all
about formatting and printing. You'll probably discover that this is too much for one object,
and that what you need is three or more objects. One object might be a catalog of all the
possible check layouts, which can be queried for information about how to print a check. One
object or set of objects can be a generic printing interface that knows all about different kinds
of printers (but nothing about bookkeeping‚Äîthis one is a candidate for buying rather than
writing yourself). And a third object could use the services of the other two to accomplish the
task. Thus, each object has a cohesive set of services it offers. In a good object-oriented
design, each object does one thing well, but doesn't try to do too much. This not only allows
the discovery of objects that might be purchased (the printer interface object), but it also
produces new objects that might be reused somewhere else (the catalog of check layouts).

Treating objects as service providers is a great simplifying tool. This is useful not only during
the design process, but also when someone else is trying to understand your code or reuse an
object. If they can see the value of the object based on what service it provides, it makes it
much easier to fit it into the design.

## üçÄ03.04 The hidden implementation
It is helpful to break up the playing field into class creators (those who create new data types)
and client programmers ‚Å¥ (the class consumers who use the data types in their applications).
The goal of the client programmer is to collect a toolbox full of classes to use for rapid
application development. The goal of the class creator is to build a class that exposes only
what's necessary to the client programmer and keeps everything else hidden. Why? Because
if it's hidden, the client programmer can't access it, which means that the class creator can
change the hidden portion at will without worrying about the impact on anyone else. The
hidden portion usually represents the tender insides of an object that could easily be
corrupted by a careless or uninformed client programmer, so hiding the implementation
reduces program bugs.

‚Å¥ I'm indebted to my friend Scott Meyers for this term.

In any relationship it's important to have boundaries that are respected by all parties
involved. When you create a library, you establish a relationship with the client programmer,
who is also a programmer, but one who is putting together an application by using your
library, possibly to build a bigger library. If all the members of a class are available to
everyone, then the client programmer can do anything with that class and there's no way to
enforce rules. Even though you might really prefer that the client programmer not directly
manipulate some of the members of your class, without access control there's no way to
prevent it. Everything's naked to the world.

So the first reason for access control is to keep client programmers' hands off portions they
shouldn't touch‚Äîparts that are necessary for the internal operation of the data type but not
part of the interface that users need in order to solve their particular problems. This is
actually a service to client programmers because they can easily see what's important to them
and what they can ignore.

The second reason for access control is to allow the library designer to change the internal
workings of the class without worrying about how it will affect the client programmer. For
example, you might implement a particular class in a simple fashion to ease development,
and then later discover that you need to rewrite it in order to make it run faster. If the
interface and implementation are clearly separated and protected, you can accomplish this
easily.

Java uses three explicit keywords to set the boundaries in a class: `public`, `private`, and
`protected`. These access specifiers determine who can use the definitions that follow.

`public` means the following element is available to everyone. The `private` keyword, on the
other hand, means that no one can access that element except you, the creator of the type,
inside methods of that type. private is a brick wall between you and the client programmer.
Someone who tries to access a private member will get a compile-time error. The

`protected` keyword acts like private, with the exception that an inheriting class has access
to protected members, but not private members. Inheritance will be introduced shortly.
Java also has a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù access, which comes into play if you don't use one of the
aforementioned specifiers. This is usually called package access because classes can access
the members of other classes in the same package (library component), but outside of the
package those same members appear to be private.

## üçÄ03.05 Reusing the implementation
Once a class has been created and tested, it should (ideally) represent a useful unit of code. It
turns out that this reusability is not nearly so easy to achieve as many would hope; it takes
experience and insight to produce a reusable object design. But once you have such a design,
it begs to be reused. Code reuse is one of the greatest advantages that object-oriented
programming languages provide.

The simplest way to reuse a class is to just use an object of that class directly, but you can 
also place an object of that class inside a new class. We call this ‚Äúcreating a member object.‚Äù
Your new class can be made up of any number and type of other objects, in any combination that
you need to achieve the functionality desired in your new class. Because you are composing a
new class from existing classes, this concept is called composition (if the composition
happens dynamically, it's usually called aggregation). Composition is often referred to as a
‚Äúhas-a‚Äù relationship, as in ‚ÄúA car has an engine.‚Äù

(This UML diagram indicates composition with the filled diamond, which states there is one
car. I will typically use a simpler form: just a line, without the diamond, to indicate an
association. ‚Åµ )

‚Åµ This is usually enough detail for most diagrams, and you don't need to get specific 
about whether you're using aggregation or composition.

Composition comes with a great deal of flexibility. The member objects of your new class are
typically private, making them inaccessible to the client programmers who are using the
class. This allows you to change those members without disturbing existing client code. You
can also change the member objects at run time, to dynamically change the behavior of your
program. Inheritance, which is described next, does not have this flexibility since the
compiler must place compile-time restrictions on classes created with inheritance.

Because inheritance is so important in object-oriented programming, it is often highly
emphasized, and the new programmer can get the idea that inheritance should be used
everywhere. This can result in awkward and overly complicated designs. Instead, you should
first look to composition when creating new classes, since it is simpler and more flexible. If
you take this approach, your designs will be cleaner. Once you've had some experience, it will
be reasonably obvious when you need inheritance.

## üçÄ03.06 Inheritance
By itself, the idea of an object is a convenient tool. It allows you to package data and
functionality together by concept, so you can represent an appropriate problem-space idea
rather than being forced to use the idioms of the underlying machine. These concepts are
expressed as fundamental units in the programming language by using the class keyword.

It seems a pity, however, to go to all the trouble to create a class and then be forced to create
a brand new one that might have similar functionality. It's nicer if we can take the existing
class, clone it, and then make additions and modifications to the clone. This is effectively
what you get with inheritance, with the exception that if the original class (called the base
class or superclass or parent class) is changed, the modified ‚Äúclone‚Äù (called the derived class
or inherited class or subclass or child class) also reflects those changes.

(The arrow in this UML diagram points from the derived class to the base class. As you will
see, there is commonly more than one derived class.)

A type does more than describe the constraints on a set of objects; it also has a relationship
with other types. Two types can have characteristics and behaviors in common, but one type
may contain more characteristics than another and may also handle more messages (or
handle them differently). Inheritance expresses this similarity between types by using the
concept of base types and derived types. A base type contains all of the characteristics and
behaviors that are shared among the types derived from it. You create a base type to

represent the core of your ideas about some objects in your system. From the base type, you
derive other types to express the different ways that this core can be realized.

For example, a trash-recycling machine sorts pieces of trash. The base type is ‚Äútrash‚Äù, and
each piece of trash has a weight, a value, and so on, and can be shredded, melted, or
decomposed. From this, more specific types of trash are derived that may have additional
characteristics (a bottle has a color) or behaviors (an aluminum can may be crushed, a steel
can is magnetic). In addition, some behaviors may be different (the value of paper depends
on its type and condition). Using inheritance, you can build a type hierarchy that expresses
the problem you're trying to solve in terms of its types.

A second example is the classic ‚Äúshape‚Äù example, perhaps used in a computer-aided design
system or game simulation. The base type is ‚Äúshape,‚Äù and each shape has a size, a color, a
position, and so on. Each shape can be drawn, erased, moved, colored, etc. From this, specific
types of shapes are derived (inherited)‚Äîcircle, square, triangle, and so on‚Äîeach of which
may have additional characteristics and behaviors. Certain shapes can be flipped, for
example. Some behaviors may be different, such as when you want to calculate the area of a
shape. The type hierarchy embodies both the similarities and differences between the shapes.

Casting the solution in the same terms as the problem is very useful because you don't need a
lot of intermediate models to get from a description of the problem to a description of the
solution. With objects, the type hierarchy is the primary model, so you go directly from the
description of the system in the real world to the description of the system in code. Indeed,
one of the difficulties people have with object-oriented design is that it's too simple to get
from the beginning to the end. A mind trained to look for complex solutions can initially be
stumped by this simplicity.

When you inherit from an existing type, you create a new type. This new type contains not
only all the members of the existing type (although the private ones are hidden away and
inaccessible), but more importantly it duplicates the interface of the base class. That is, all
the messages you can send to objects of the base class you can also send to objects of the
derived class. Since we know the type of a class by the messages we can send to it, this means
that the derived class is the same type as the base class. In the previous example, ‚ÄúA circle is
a shape.‚Äù This type equivalence via inheritance is one of the fundamental gateways in
understanding the meaning of object-oriented programming.

Since both the base class and derived class have the same fundamental interface, there must
be some implementation to go along with that interface. That is, there must be some code to
execute when an object receives a particular message. If you simply inherit a class and don't
do anything else, the methods from the base-class interface come right along into the derived
class. That means objects of the derived class have not only the same type, they also have the
same behavior, which isn't particularly interesting.

You have two ways to differentiate your new derived class from the original base class. The
first is quite straightforward: You simply add brand new methods to the derived class. These
new methods are not part of the base-class interface. This means that the base class simply
didn't do as much as you wanted it to, so you added more methods. This simple and primitive
use for inheritance is, at times, the perfect solution to your problem. However, you should
look closely for the possibility that your base class might also need these additional methods.
This process of discovery and iteration of your design happens regularly in object-oriented
programming.

Although inheritance may sometimes imply (especially in Java, where the keyword for
inheritance is extends) that you are going to add new methods to the interface, that's not
necessarily true. The second and more important way to differentiate your new class is to
change the behavior of an existing base-class method. This is referred to as overriding that
method.

To override a method, you simply create a new definition for the method in the derived class.
You're saying, ‚ÄúI'm using the same interface method here, but I want it to do something
different for my new type.‚Äù

### ‚òò Is-a vs. is-like-a relationships
There's a certain debate that can occur about inheritance: Should inheritance override only
baseclass methods (and not add new methods that aren't in the base class)? This would mean
that the derived class is exactly the same type as the base class since it has exactly the same
interface. As a result, you can exactly substitute an object of the derived class for an object of
the base class. This can be thought of as pure substitution, and it's often referred to as the
substitution principle. In a sense, this is the ideal way to treat inheritance. We often refer to
the relationship between the base class and derived classes in this case as an is-a
relationship, because you can say, ‚ÄúA circle is a shape.‚Äù A test for inheritance is to determine
whether you can state the is-a relationship about the classes and have it make sense.

There are times when you must add new interface elements to a derived type, thus extending
the interface. The new type can still be substituted for the base type, but the substitution isn't
perfect because your new methods are not accessible from the base type. This can be
described as an islike-a relationship (my term). The new type has the interface of the old type
but it also contains other methods, so you can't really say it's exactly the same. For example,
consider an air conditioner. Suppose your house is wired with all the controls for cooling;
that is, it has an interface that allows you to control cooling. Imagine that the air conditioner
breaks down and you replace it with a heat pump, which can both heat and cool. The heat
pump is-like-an air conditioner, but it can do more. Because the control system of your house
is designed only to control cooling, it is restricted to communication with the cooling part of
the new object. The interface of the new object has been extended, and the existing system
doesn't know about anything except the original interface.

Of course, once you see this design it becomes clear that the base class ‚Äúcooling system‚Äù is not
general enough, and should be renamed to ‚Äútemperature control system‚Äù so that it can also
include heating‚Äîat which point the substitution principle will work. However, this diagram
is an example of what can happen with design in the real world.

When you see the substitution principle it's easy to feel like this approach (pure substitution)
is the only way to do things, and in fact it is nice if your design works out that way. But you'll
find that there are times when it's equally clear that you must add new methods to the
interface of a derived class. With inspection both cases should be reasonably obvious.

## üçÄ03.07 Interchangeable objects with polymorphism
When dealing with type hierarchies, you often want to treat an object not as the specific type
that it is, but instead as its base type. This allows you to write code that doesn't depend on
specific types. In the shape example, methods manipulate generic shapes, unconcerned about
whether they're circles, squares, triangles, or some shape that hasn't even been defined yet.
All shapes can be drawn, erased, and moved, so these methods simply send a message to a
shape object; they don't worry about how the object copes with the message.

Such code is unaffected by the addition of new types, and adding new types is the most
common way to extend an object-oriented program to handle new situations. For example,
you can derive a new subtype of shape called pentagon without modifying the methods that
deal only with generic shapes. This ability to easily extend a design by deriving new subtypes
is one of the essential ways to encapsulate change. This greatly improves designs while
reducing the cost of software maintenance.

There's a problem, however, with attempting to treat derived-type objects as their generic
base types (circles as shapes, bicycles as vehicles, cormorants as birds, etc.). If a method is
going to tell a generic shape to draw itself, or a generic vehicle to steer, or a generic bird to
move, the compiler cannot know at compile time precisely what piece of code will be
executed. That's the whole point‚Äîwhen the message is sent, the programmer doesn't want to
know what piece of code will be executed; the draw method can be applied equally to a circle,
a square, or a triangle, and the object will execute the proper code depending on its specific
type.

If you don't have to know what piece of code will be executed, then when you add a new
subtype, the code it executes can be different without requiring changes to the method that
calls it. Therefore, the compiler cannot know precisely what piece of code is executed, so what
does it do?

For example, in the following diagram the BirdController object just works with generic
Bird objects and does not know what exact type they are. This is convenient from
BirdController's perspective because it doesn't have to write special code to determine the
exact type of Bird it's working with or that Bird's behavior. So how does it happen that,
when move( ) is called while ignoring the specific type of Bird, the right behavior will occur
(a Goose walks, flies, or swims, and a Penguin walks or swims)?

The answer is the primary twist in object-oriented programming: The compiler cannot make
a function call in the traditional sense. The function call generated by a non-OOP compiler
causes what is called early binding, a term you may not have heard before because you've
never thought about it any other way. It means the compiler generates a call to a specific
function name, and the runtime system resolves this call to the absolute address of the code
to be executed. In OOP, the program cannot determine the address of the code until run
time, so some other scheme is necessary when a message is sent to a generic object.
To solve the problem, object-oriented languages use the concept of late binding. When you
send a message to an object, the code being called isn't determined until run time. The
compiler does ensure that the method exists and performs type checking on the arguments
and return value, but it doesn't know the exact code to execute.

To perform late binding, Java uses a special bit of code in lieu of the absolute call. This code
calculates the address of the method body, using information stored in the object (this
process is covered in great detail in the Polymorphism chapter). Thus, each object can
behave differently according to the contents of that special bit of code. When you send a
message to an object, the object actually does figure out what to do with that message.
In some languages you must explicitly state that you want a method to have the flexibility of
latebinding properties (C++ uses the virtual keyword to do this). In these languages, by
default, methods are not dynamically bound. In Java, dynamic binding is the default
behavior and you don't need to remember to add any extra keywords in order to get
polymorphism.

Consider the shape example. The family of classes (all based on the same uniform interface)
was diagrammed earlier in this chapter. To demonstrate polymorphism, we want to write a
single piece of code that ignores the specific details of type and talks only to the base class.
That code is decoupled from type-specific information and thus is simpler to write and easier
to understand. And, if a new type‚Äîa Hexagon, for example‚Äîis added through inheritance,
the code you write will work just as well for the new type of Shape as it did on the existing
types. Thus, the program is extensible.

If you write a method in Java (as you will soon learn how to do):
```java
void doSomething(Shape shape) {
    shape.erase();
    // ...
    shape.draw();
}
```
This method speaks to any Shape, so it is independent of the specific type of object that it's
drawing and erasing. If some other part of the program uses the doSomething( ) method:
```java
Circle circle = new Circle();
Triangle triangle = new Triangle();
Line line= new Line();
doSomething(circle);
doSomething(triangle);
doSomething(line);
```
The calls to doSomething( ) automatically work correctly, regardless of the exact type of
the object.

This is a rather amazing trick. Consider the line:

    doSomething(circle);

What's happening here is that a Circle is being passed into a method that's expecting a
Shape. Since a Circle is a Shape it can be treated as one by doSomething( ). That is, any
message that doSomething( ) can send to a Shape, a Circle can accept. So it is a
completely safe and logical thing to do.

We call this process of treating a derived type as though it were its base type upcasting. The
name cast is used in the sense of casting into a mold and the up comes from the way the
inheritance diagram is typically arranged, with the base type at the top and the derived
classes fanning out downward. Thus, casting to a base type is moving up the inheritance
diagram: ‚Äúupcasting.‚Äù

                  +------------+
                  |    Shape   |
                  |------------|
                  |     draw() |
                  |    erase() |
                  |     move() |
                  | getColor() |
              ‚Üë   | setColor() |
         /----+   +------------+
         |              ‚Üë
      /--+  /-----------+-----------\
      |     ‚Üë           ‚Üë           ‚Üë
      | +--------+  +--------+  +----------+
      ¬∑ | Circle |  | Square |  | Triangle |
        +--------+  +--------+  +----------+

An object-oriented program contains some upcasting somewhere, because that's how you
decouple yourself from knowing about the exact type you're working with. Look at the code
in doSomething( ):

    shape.erase();
    // ...
    shape.draw();

Notice that it doesn't say, ‚ÄúIf you're a Circle, do this, if you're a Square, do that, etc.‚Äù If you
write that kind of code, which checks for all the possible types that a Shape can actually be,
it's messy and you need to change it every time you add a new kind of Shape. Here, you just
say, ‚ÄúYou're a shape, I know you can erase( ) and draw( ) yourself, do it, and take care of
the details correctly.‚Äù

What's impressive about the code in doSomething( ) is that, somehow, the right thing
happens. Calling draw( ) for Circle causes different code to be executed than when calling
draw( ) for a Square or a Line, but when the draw( ) message is sent to an anonymous
Shape, the correct behavior occurs based on the actual type of the Shape. This is amazing
because, as mentioned earlier, when the Java compiler is compiling the code for
doSomething( ), it cannot know exactly what types it is dealing with. So ordinarily, you'd
expect it to end up calling the version of erase( ) and draw( ) for the base class Shape, and
not for the specific Circle, Square, or Line. And yet the right thing happens because of
polymorphism. The compiler and runtime system handle the details; all you need to know
right now is that it does happen, and more importantly, how to design with it. When you
send a message to an object, the object will do the right thing, even when upcasting is
involved.

## üçÄ03.08 The singly rooted hierarchy
One of the issues in OOP that has become especially prominent since the introduction of C++
is whether all classes should ultimately be inherited from a single base class. In Java (as with
virtually all other OOP languages except for C++) the answer is yes, and the name of this
ultimate base class is simply Object. It turns out that the benefits of the singly rooted
hierarchy are many.

All objects in a singly rooted hierarchy have an interface in common, so they are all
ultimately the same fundamental type. The alternative (provided by C++) is that you don't
know that everything is the same basic type. From a backward-compatibility standpoint this
fits the model of C better and can be thought of as less restrictive, but when you want to do
full-on objectoriented programming you must then build your own hierarchy to provide the
same convenience that's built into other OOP languages. And in any new class library you
acquire, some other incompatible interface will be used. It requires effort (and possibly
multiple inheritance) to work the new interface into your design. Is the extra ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù
of C++ worth it? If you need it‚Äîif you have a large investment in C‚Äîit's quite valuable.
If you're starting from scratch, other alternatives such as Java can often be more productive.
All objects in a singly rooted hierarchy can be guaranteed to have certain functionality. You
know you can perform certain basic operations on every object in your system. All objects can
easily be created on the heap, and argument passing is greatly simplified.

A singly rooted hierarchy makes it much easier to implement a garbage collector, which is
one of the fundamental improvements of Java over C++. And since information about the
type of an object is guaranteed to be in all objects, you'll never end up with an object whose
type you cannot determine. This is especially important with system-level operations, such as
exception handling, and to allow greater flexibility in programming.

## üçÄ03.09 Containers
In general, you don't know how many objects you're going to need to solve a particular
problem, or how long they will last. You also don't know how to store those objects. How can
you know how much space to create if that information isn't known until run time?

The solution to most problems in object-oriented design seems flippant: You create another
type of object. The new type of object that solves this particular problem holds references to
other objects. Of course, you can do the same thing with an array, which is available in most
languages. But this new object, generally called a container (also called a collection, but the
Java library uses that term in a different sense so this book will use ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù), will expand
itself whenever necessary to accommodate everything you place inside it. So you don't need
to know how many objects you're going to hold in a container. Just create a container object
and let it take care of the details.

Fortunately, a good OOP language comes with a set of containers as part of the package. In
C++, it's part of the Standard C++ Library and is often called the Standard Template Library
(STL). Smalltalk has a very complete set of containers. Java also has numerous containers in
its standard library. In some libraries, one or two generic containers is considered good
enough for all needs, and in others (Java, for example) the library has different types of
containers for different needs: several different kinds of List classes (to hold sequences),
Maps (also known as associative arrays, to associate objects with other objects), Sets (to
hold one of each type of object), and more components such as queues, trees, stacks, etc.

From a design standpoint, all you really want is a container that can be manipulated to solve
your problem. If a single type of container satisfied all of your needs, there'd be no reason to
have different kinds. There are two reasons that you need a choice of containers. First,
containers provide different types of interfaces and external behavior. A stack has a different
interface and behavior than a queue, which is different from a set or a list. One of these might
provide a more flexible solution to your problem than the other. Second, different containers
have different efficiencies for certain operations. 

For example, there are two basic types of
List: ArrayList and LinkedList. Both are simple sequences that can have identical
interfaces and external behaviors. But certain operations can have significantly different
costs. Randomly accessing elements in an ArrayList is a constant-time operation; it takes
the same amount of time regardless of the element you select. However, in a LinkedList it is
expensive to move through the list to randomly select an element, and it takes longer to find
an element that is farther down the list. On the other hand, if you want to insert an element
in the middle of a sequence, it's cheaper in a LinkedList than in an ArrayList. These and
other operations have different efficiencies depending on the underlying structure of the
sequence. You might start building your program with a LinkedList and, when tuning for
performance, change to an ArrayList. Because of the abstraction via the interface List, you
can change from one to the other with minimal impact on your code.

### ‚òò Parameterized types (generics)
Before Java SE5, containers held the one universal type in Java: Object. The singly rooted
hierarchy means that everything is an Object, so a container that holds Objects can hold
anything. ‚Å∂ This made containers easy to reuse.

‚Å∂ They do not hold primitives, but Java SE5 autoboxing makes this restriction almost a 
non-issue. This is discussed in detail later in the book.

To use such a container, you simply add object references to it and later ask for them back.
But, since the container held only Objects, when you added an object reference into the
container it was upcast to Object, thus losing its character. When fetching it back, you got an
Object reference, and not a reference to the type that you put in. So how do you turn it back
into something that has the specific type of the object that you put into the container?
Here, the cast is used again, but this time you're not casting up the inheritance hierarchy to a
more general type. Instead, you cast down the hierarchy to a more specific type. This manner
of casting is called downcasting. With upcasting, you know, for example, that a Circle is a
type of Shape so it's safe to upcast, but you don't know that an Object is necessarily a
Circle or a Shape so it's hardly safe to downcast unless you know exactly what you're
dealing with.

It's not completely dangerous, however, because if you downcast to the wrong thing you'll get
a runtime error called an exception, which will be described shortly. When you fetch object
references from a container, though, you must have some way to remember exactly what they
are so you can perform a proper downcast.

Downcasting and the runtime checks require extra time for the running program and extra
effort from the programmer. Wouldn't it make sense to somehow create the container so that
it knows the types that it holds, eliminating the need for the downcast and a possible
mistake? The solution is called a parameterized type mechanism. A parameterized type is a
class that the compiler can automatically customize to work with particular types. For
example, with a parameterized container, the compiler could customize that container so that
it would accept only Shapes and fetch only Shapes.

One of the big changes in Java SE5 is the addition of parameterized types, called generics in
Java. You'll recognize the use of generics by the angle brackets with types inside; for example,
an ArrayList that holds Shape can be created like this:

    ArrayList<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<Shape>();

There have also been changes to many of the standard library components in order to take
advantage of generics. As you will see, generics have an impact on much of the code in this
book.

## üçÄ03.10 Object creation & lifetime
One critical issue when working with objects is the way they are created and destroyed. Each
object requires resources, most notably memory, in order to exist. When an object is no
longer needed it must be cleaned up so that these resources are released for reuse. In simple
programming situations the question of how an object is cleaned up doesn't seem too
challenging: You create the object, use it for as long as it's needed, and then it should be
destroyed. However, it's not hard to encounter situations that are more complex.

Suppose, for example, you are designing a system to manage air traffic for an airport. (The
same model might also work for managing crates in a warehouse, or a video rental system, or
a kennel for boarding pets.) At first it seems simple: Make a container to hold airplanes, then
create a new airplane and place it in the container for each airplane that enters the air-traffic-control zone. 
For cleanup, simply clean up the appropriate airplane object when a plane leaves the zone.

But perhaps you have some other system to record data about the planes; perhaps data that
doesn't require such immediate attention as the main controller function. Maybe it's a record
of the flight plans of all the small planes that leave the airport. So you have a second
container of small planes, and whenever you create a plane object you also put it in this
second container if it's a small plane. Then some background process performs operations on
the objects in this container during idle moments.

Now the problem is more difficult: How can you possibly know when to destroy the objects?
When you're done with the object, some other part of the system might not be. This same
problem can arise in a number of other situations, and in programming systems (such as
C++) in which you must explicitly delete an object when you're done with it this can become
quite complex.

Where is the data for an object and how is the lifetime of the object controlled? C++ takes the
approach that control of efficiency is the most important issue, so it gives the programmer a
choice. For maximum runtime speed, the storage and lifetime can be determined while the
program is being written, by placing the objects on the stack (these are sometimes called
automatic or scoped variables) or in the static storage area. This places a priority on the
speed of storage allocation and release, and this control can be very valuable in some
situations. However, you sacrifice flexibility because you must know the exact quantity,
lifetime, and type of objects while you're writing the program. If you are trying to solve a
more general problem such as computer-aided design, warehouse management, or air-traffic
control, this is too restrictive.

The second approach is to create objects dynamically in a pool of memory called the heap. In
this approach, you don't know until run time how many objects you need, what their lifetime
is, or what their exact type is. Those are determined at the spur of the moment while the
program is running. If you need a new object, you simply make it on the heap at the point
that you need it. Because the storage is managed dynamically, at run time, the amount of
time required to allocate storage on the heap can be noticeably longer than the time to create
storage on the stack. Creating storage on the stack is often a single assembly instruction to
move the stack pointer down and another to move it back up. The time to create heap storage
depends on the design of the storage mechanism.

The dynamic approach makes the generally logical assumption that objects tend to be
complicated, so the extra overhead of finding storage and releasing that storage will not have
an important impact on the creation of an object. In addition, the greater flexibility is
essential to solve the general programming problem.

Java uses dynamic memory allocation, exclusively. ‚Å∑ Every time you want to create an object,
you use the new operator to build a dynamic instance of that object.

‚Å∑ Primitive types, which you'll learn about later, are a special case.

There's another issue, however, and that's the lifetime of an object. With languages that allow
objects to be created on the stack, the compiler determines how long the object lasts and can
automatically destroy it. However, if you create it on the heap the compiler has no knowledge
of its lifetime. In a language like C++, you must determine programmatically when to destroy
the object, which can lead to memory leaks if you don't do it correctly (and this is a common
problem in C++ programs). Java provides a feature called a garbage collector that
automatically discovers when an object is no longer in use and destroys it. A garbage
collector is much more convenient because it reduces the number of issues that you must
track and the code you must write. More importantly, the garbage collector provides a much
higher level of insurance against the insidious problem of memory leaks, which has brought
many a C++ project to its knees.

With Java, the garbage collector is designed to take care of the problem of releasing the
memory (although this doesn't include other aspects of cleaning up an object). The garbage
collector ‚Äúknows‚Äù when an object is no longer in use, and it then automatically releases the
memory for that object. This, combined with the fact that all objects are inherited from the
single root class Object and that you can create objects only one way‚Äîon the heap‚Äîmakes
the process of programming in Java much simpler than programming in C++. You have far
fewer decisions to make and hurdles to overcome.

## üçÄ03.11 Exception handling: dealing with errors
Ever since the beginning of programming languages, error handling has been a particularly
difficult issue. Because it's so hard to design a good error-handling scheme, many languages
simply ignore the issue, passing the problem on to library designers who come up with
halfway measures that work in many situations but that can easily be circumvented, generally
by just ignoring them. A major problem with most error-handling schemes is that they rely
on programmer vigilance in following an agreed-upon convention that is not enforced by the
language. If the programmer is not vigilant‚Äîoften the case if they are in a hurry‚Äîthese
schemes can easily be forgotten.

Exception handling wires error handling directly into the programming language and
sometimes even the operating system. An exception is an object that is ‚Äúthrown‚Äù from the site
of the error and can be ‚Äúcaught‚Äù by an appropriate exception handler designed to handle that
particular type of error. It's as if exception handling is a different, parallel path of execution
that can be taken when things go wrong. And because it uses a separate execution path, it
doesn't need to interfere with your normally executing code. This tends to make that code
simpler to write because you aren't constantly forced to check for errors. In addition, a
thrown exception is unlike an error value that's returned from a method or a flag that's set by
a method in order to indicate an error condition‚Äîthese can be ignored. An exception cannot
be ignored, so it's guaranteed to be dealt with at some point. Finally, exceptions provide a
way to reliably recover from a bad situation. Instead of just exiting the program, you are
often able to set things right and restore execution, which produces much more robust
programs.

Java's exception handling stands out among programming languages, because in Java,
exception handling was wired in from the beginning and you're forced to use it. It is the
single acceptable way to report errors. If you don't write your code to properly handle
exceptions, you'll get a compile-time error message. This guaranteed consistency can
sometimes make error handling much easier.

It's worth noting that exception handling isn't an object-oriented feature, although in object-
oriented languages the exception is normally represented by an object. Exception handling
existed before object-oriented languages.

## üçÄ03.12 Concurrent programming
A fundamental concept in computer programming is the idea of handling more than one task
at a time. Many programming problems require that the program stop what it's doing, deal
with some other problem, and then return to the main process. The solution has been
approached in many ways. Initially, programmers with low-level knowledge of the machine
wrote interrupt service routines, and the suspension of the main process was initiated
through a hardware interrupt. Although this worked well, it was difficult and non-portable,
so it made moving a program to a new type of machine slow and expensive.

Sometimes, interrupts are necessary for handling time-critical tasks, but there's a large class
of problems in which you're simply trying to partition the problem into separately running
pieces (tasks) so that the whole program can be more responsive. Within a program, these
separately running pieces are called threads, and the general concept is called concurrency.
A common example of concurrency is the user interface. By using tasks, a user can press a
button and get a quick response rather than being forced to wait until the program finishes
its current task.

Ordinarily, tasks are just a way to allocate the time of a single processor. But if the operating
system supports multiple processors, each task can be assigned to a different processor, and
they can truly run in parallel. One of the convenient features of concurrency at the language
level is that the programmer doesn't need to worry about whether there are many processors
or just one. The program is logically divided into tasks, and if the machine has more than one
processor, then the program runs faster, without any special adjustments.

All this makes concurrency sound pretty simple. There is a catch: shared resources. If you
have more than one task running that's expecting to access the same resource, you have a
problem. For example, two processes can't simultaneously send information to a printer. To
solve the problem, resources that can be shared, such as the printer, must be locked while
they are being used. So a task locks a resource, completes its task, and then releases the lock
so that someone else can use the resource.

Java's concurrency is built into the language, and Java SE5 has added significant additional
library support.

## üçÄ03.13 Java and the Internet
If Java is, in fact, yet another computer programming language, you may question why it is
so important and why it is being promoted as a revolutionary step in computer
programming. The answer isn't immediately obvious if you're coming from a traditional
programming perspective. Although Java is very useful for solving traditional standalone
programming problems, it is also important because it solves programming problems for the
World Wide Web.

### ‚òò What is the Web?
The Web can seem a bit of a mystery at first, with all this talk of ‚Äúsurfing,‚Äù ‚Äúpresence,‚Äù and
‚Äúhome pages.‚Äù It's helpful to step back and see what it really is, but to do this you must
understand client/server systems, another aspect of computing that's full of confusing issues.

#### Client/server computing
The primary idea of a client/server system is that you have a central repository of
information‚Äî some kind of data, usually in a database‚Äîthat you want to distribute on
demand to some set of people or machines. A key to the client/server concept is that the
repository of information is centrally located so that it can be changed and so that those
changes will propagate out to the information consumers. Taken together, the information
repository, the software that distributes the information, and the machine(s) where the
information and software reside are called ‚Äúthe server.‚Äù The software that resides on the
consumer machine, communicates with the server, fetches the information, processes it, and
then displays it on the consumer machine is called the client.

The basic concept of client/server computing, then, is not so complicated. The problems arise
because you have a single server trying to serve many clients at once. Generally, a database
management system is involved, so the designer ‚Äúbalances‚Äù the layout of data into tables for
optimal use. In addition, systems often allow a client to insert new information into a server.
This means you must ensure that one client's new data doesn't walk over another client's new
data, or that data isn't lost in the process of adding it to the database (this is called
transaction processing). As client software changes, it must be built, debugged, and installed
on the client machines, which turns out to be more complicated and expensive than you
might think. It's especially problematic to support multiple types of computers and operating
systems. Finally, there's the all-important performance issue: You might have hundreds of
clients making requests of your server at any moment, so a small delay can be critical. To
minimize latency, programmers work hard to offload processing tasks, often to the client
machine, but sometimes to other machines at the server site, using so-called middleware.
(Middleware is also used to improve maintainability.)

The simple idea of distributing information has so many layers of complexity that the whole
problem can seem hopelessly enigmatic. And yet it's crucial: Client/server computing
accounts for roughly half of all programming activities. It's responsible for everything from
taking orders and credit-card transactions to the distribution of any kind of data‚Äîstock
market, scientific, government, you name it. What we've come up with in the past is
individual solutions to individual problems, inventing a new solution each time. These were
hard to create and hard to use, and the user had to learn a new interface for each one. The
entire client/server problem needed to be solved in a big way.

#### The Web as a giant server
The Web is actually one giant client/server system. It's a bit worse than that, since you have
all the servers and clients coexisting on a single network at once. You don't need to know
that, because all you care about is connecting to and interacting with one server at a time
(even though you might be hopping around the world in your search for the correct server).

Initially it was a simple one-way process. You made a request of a server and it handed you a
file, which your machine's browser software (i.e., the client) would interpret by formatting
onto your local machine. But in short order people began wanting to do more than just
deliver pages from a server. They wanted full client/server capability so that the client could
feed information back to the server, for example, to do database lookups on the server, to add
new information to the server, or to place an order (which requires special security
measures). These are the changes we've been seeing in the development of the Web.

The Web browser was a big step forward: the concept that one piece of information can be
displayed on any type of computer without change. However, the original browsers were still
rather primitive and rapidly bogged down by the demands placed on them. They weren't
particularly interactive, and tended to clog up both the server and the Internet because
whenever you needed to do something that required programming you had to send
information back to the server to be processed. It could take many seconds or minutes to find
out you had misspelled something in your request. Since the browser was just a viewer it
couldn't perform even the simplest computing tasks. (On the other hand, it was safe, because
it couldn't execute any programs on your local machine that might contain bugs or viruses.)
To solve this problem, different approaches have been taken. To begin with, graphics
standards have been enhanced to allow better animation and video within browsers. The
remainder of the problem can be solved only by incorporating the ability to run programs on
the client end, under the browser. This is called client-side programming.

### ‚òò Client-side programming
The Web's initial server-browser design provided for interactive content, but the interactivity
was completely provided by the server. The server produced static pages for the client
browser, which would simply interpret and display them. Basic HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) contains simple mechanisms for data gathering: text-entry boxes, check
boxes, radio boxes, lists and dropdown lists, as well as a button that could only be
programmed to reset the data on the form or ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù the data on the form back to the
server. This submission passes through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) provided on
all Web servers. The text within the submission tells CGI what to do with it. The most
common action is to run a program located on the server in a directory that's typically called
‚Äúcgi-bin.‚Äù (If you watch the address window at the top of your browser when you push a
button on a Web page, you can sometimes see ‚Äúcgi-bin‚Äù within all the gobbledygook there.)
These programs can be written in most languages. Perl has been a common choice because it
is designed for text manipulation and is interpreted, so it can be installed on any server
regardless of processor or operating system. However, Python (www.Python.org) has been
making inroads because of its greater power and simplicity.

Many powerful Web sites today are built strictly on CGI, and you can in fact do nearly
anything with CGI. However, Web sites built on CGI programs can rapidly become overly
complicated to maintain, and there is also the problem of response time. The response of a
CGI program depends on how much data must be sent, as well as the load on both the server
and the Internet. (On top of this, starting a CGI program tends to be slow.) The initial
designers of the Web did not foresee how rapidly this bandwidth would be exhausted for the
kinds of applications people developed. For example, any sort of dynamic graphing is nearly
impossible to perform with consistency because a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) file
must be created and moved from the server to the client for each version of the graph. In
addition, you've no doubt experienced the process of data validation for a Web input form.

You press the submit button on a page; the data is shipped back to the server; the server
starts a CGI program that discovers an error, formats an HTML page informing you of the
error, and then sends the page back to you; you must then back up a page and try again. 
Not only is this slow, it's inelegant.

The solution is client-side programming. Most desktop computers that run Web browsers are
powerful engines capable of doing vast work, and with the original static HTML approach
they are sitting there, just idly waiting for the server to dish up the next page. Client-side
programming means that the Web browser is harnessed to do whatever work it can, and the
result for the user is a much speedier and more interactive experience at your Web site.

The problem with discussions of client-side programming is that they aren't very different
from discussions of programming in general. The parameters are almost the same, but the
platform is different; a Web browser is like a limited operating system. In the end, you must
still program, and this accounts for the dizzying array of problems and solutions produced by
client-side programming. The rest of this section provides an overview of the issues and
approaches in client-side programming.

#### Plug-ins
One of the most significant steps forward in client-side programming is the development of
the plug-in. This is a way for a programmer to add new functionality to the browser by
downloading a piece of code that plugs itself into the appropriate spot in the browser. It tells
the browser, ‚ÄúFrom now on you can perform this new activity.‚Äù (You need to download the
plug-in only once.) Some fast and powerful behavior is added to browsers via plug-ins, but
writing a plug-in is not a trivial task, and isn't something you'd want to do as part of the
process of building a particular site. The value of the plug-in for client-side programming is
that it allows an expert programmer to develop extensions and add those extensions to a
browser without the permission of the browser manufacturer. Thus, plug-ins provide a ‚Äúback
door‚Äù that allows the creation of new client-side programming languages (although not all
languages are implemented as plug-ins).

#### Scripting languages
Plug-ins resulted in the development of browser scripting languages. With a scripting
language, you embed the source code for your client-side program directly into the HTML
page, and the plug-in that interprets that language is automatically activated while the HTML
page is being displayed. Scripting languages tend to be reasonably easy to understand and,
because they are simply text that is part of an HTML page, they load very quickly as part of
the single server hit required to procure that page. The trade-off is that your code is exposed
for everyone to see (and steal). Generally, however, you aren't doing amazingly sophisticated
things with scripting languages, so this is not too much of a hardship.

One scripting language that you can expect a Web browser to support without a plug-in is
JavaScript (this has only a passing resemblance to Java and you'll have to climb an additional
learning curve to use it. It was named that way just to grab some of Java's marketing
momentum). Unfortunately, most Web browsers originally implemented JavaScript in a
different way from the other Web browsers, and even from other versions of themselves. The
standardization of JavaScript in the form of ECMAScript has helped, but it has taken a long
time for the various browsers to catch up (and it didn't help that Microsoft was pushing its
own agenda in the form of VBScript, which also had vague similarities to JavaScript). In
general, you must program in a kind of least-common-denominator form of JavaScript in
order to be able to run on all browsers. Dealing with errors and debugging JavaScript can
only be described as a mess. As proof of its difficulty, only recently has anyone created a truly
complex piece of JavaScript (Google, in GMail), and that required excessive dedication and
expertise.

This points out that the scripting languages used inside Web browsers are really intended to
solve specific types of problems, primarily the creation of richer and more interactive
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, a scripting language might solve 80 percent of the
problems encountered in client-side programming. Your problems might very well fit
completely within that 80 percent, and since scripting languages can allow easier and faster
development, you should probably consider a scripting language before looking at a more
involved solution such as Java programming.

#### Java
If a scripting language can solve 80 percent of the client-side programming problems, what
about the other 20 percent‚Äîthe ‚Äúreally hard stuff‚Äù? Java is a popular solution for this. Not
only is it a powerful programming language built to be secure, cross-platform, and
international, but Java is being continually extended to provide language features and
libraries that elegantly handle problems that are difficult in traditional programming
languages, such as concurrency, database access, network programming, and distributed
computing. Java allows client-side programming via the applet and with Java Web Start.

An applet is a mini-program that will run only under a Web browser. The applet is
downloaded automatically as part of a Web page (just as, for example, a graphic is
automatically downloaded). When the applet is activated, it executes a program. This is part
of its beauty‚Äîit provides you with a way to automatically distribute the client software from
the server at the time the user needs the client software, and no sooner. The user gets the
latest version of the client software without fail and without difficult reinstallation. Because
of the way Java is designed, the programmer needs to create only a single program, and that
program automatically works with all computers that have browsers with built-in Java
interpreters. (This safely includes the vast majority of machines.) Since Java is a full-fledged
programming language, you can do as much work as possible on the client before and after
making requests of the server. For example, you won't need to send a request form across the
Internet to discover that you've gotten a date or some other parameter wrong, and your client
computer can quickly do the work of plotting data instead of waiting for the server to make a
plot and ship a graphic image back to you. Not only do you get the immediate win of speed
and responsiveness, but the general network traffic and load on servers can be reduced,
preventing the entire Internet from slowing down.

#### Alternatives
To be honest, Java applets have not particularly lived up to their initial fanfare. When Java
first appeared, what everyone seemed most excited about was applets, because these would
finally allow serious client-side programmability, to increase responsiveness and decrease
bandwidth requirements for Internet-based applications. People envisioned vast
possibilities.

Indeed, you can find some very clever applets on the Web. But the overwhelming move to
applets never happened. The biggest problem was probably that the 10 MB download
necessary to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) was too scary for the average user.
The fact that Microsoft chose not to include the JRE with Internet Explorer may have sealed
its fate. In any event, Java applets didn't happen on a large scale.

Nonetheless, applets and Java Web Start applications are still valuable in some situations.
Anytime you have control over user machines, for example within a corporation, it is
reasonable to distribute and update client applications using these technologies, and this can
save considerable time, effort, and money, especially if you need to do frequent updates.
In the Graphical User Interfaces chapter, we will look at one promising new technology,
Macromedia's Flex, which allows you to create Flash-based applet-equivalents. Because the
Flash Player is available on upwards of 98 percent of all Web browsers (including Windows,
Linux and the Mac) it can be considered an accepted standard. Installing or upgrading the
Flash Player is quick and easy. The ActionScript language is based on ECMAScript so it is
reasonably familiar, but Flex allows you to program without worrying about browser
specifics‚Äîthus it is far more attractive than JavaScript. For client-side programming, this is
an alternative worth considering.

#### .NET and C#
For a while, the main competitor to Java applets was Microsoft's ActiveX, although that
required that the client be running Windows. Since then, Microsoft has produced a full
competitor to Java in the form of the .NET platform and the C# programming language. The
.NET platform is roughly the same as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM; the software platform
on which Java programs execute) and Java libraries, and C# bears unmistakable similarities
to Java. This is certainly the best work that Microsoft has done in the arena of programming
languages and programming environments. Of course, they had the considerable advantage
of being able to see what worked well and what didn't work so well in Java, and build upon
that, but build they have. This is the first time since its inception that Java has had any real
competition. As a result, the Java designers at Sun have taken a hard look at C# and why
programmers might want to move to it, and have responded by making fundamental
improvements to Java in Java SE5.

Currently, the main vulnerability and important question concerning .NET is whether
Microsoft will allow it to be completely ported to other platforms. They claim there's no
problem doing this, and the Mono project (www.go-mono.com) has a partial
implementation of .NET working on Linux, but until the implementation is complete and
Microsoft has not decided to squash any part of it, .NET as a cross-platform solution is still a
risky bet.

#### Internet vs. intranet
The Web is the most general solution to the client/server problem, so it makes sense to use
the same technology to solve a subset of the problem, in particular the classic client/server
problem within a company. With traditional client/server approaches you have the problem
of multiple types of client computers, as well as the difficulty of installing new client software,
both of which are handily solved with Web browsers and client-side programming. When
Web technology is used for an information network that is restricted to a particular company,
it is referred to as an intranet. Intranets provide much greater security than the Internet,
since you can physically control access to the servers within your company. In terms of
training, it seems that once people understand the general concept of a browser it's much
easier for them to deal with differences in the way pages and applets look, so the learning
curve for new kinds of systems seems to be reduced.

The security problem brings us to one of the divisions that seems to be automatically forming
in the world of client-side programming. If your program is running on the Internet, you
don't know what platform it will be working under, and you want to be extra careful that you
don't disseminate buggy code. You need something cross-platform and secure, like a
scripting language or Java.

If you're running on an intranet, you might have a different set of constraints. It's not
uncommon that your machines could all be Intel/Windows platforms. On an intranet, you're
responsible for the quality of your own code and can repair bugs when they're discovered. In
addition, you might already have a body of legacy code that you've been using in a more
traditional client/server approach, whereby you must physically install client programs every
time you do an upgrade. The time wasted in installing upgrades is the most compelling
reason to move to browsers, because upgrades are invisible and automatic (Java Web Start is
also a solution to this problem). If you are involved in such an intranet, the most sensible
approach to take is the shortest path that allows you to use your existing code base, rather
than trying to recode your programs in a new language.

When faced with this bewildering array of solutions to the client-side programming problem,
the best plan of attack is a cost-benefit analysis. Consider the constraints of your problem
and what would be the shortest path to your solution. Since client-side programming is still
programming, it's always a good idea to take the fastest development approach for your
particular situation. This is an aggressive stance to prepare for inevitable encounters with the
problems of program development.

### ‚òò Server-side programming
This whole discussion has ignored the issue of server-side programming, which is arguably
where Java has had its greatest success. What happens when you make a request of a server?
Most of the time the request is simply ‚ÄúSend me this file.‚Äù Your browser then interprets the
file in some appropriate fashion: as an HTML page, a graphic image, a Java applet, a script
program, etc.

A more complicated request to a server generally involves a database transaction. A common
scenario involves a request for a complex database search, which the server then formats into
an HTML page and sends to you as the result. (Of course, if the client has more intelligence
via Java or a scripting language, the raw data can be sent and formatted at the client end,
which will be faster and less load on the server.) Or you might want to register your name in a
database when you join a group or place an order, which will involve changes to that
database. These database requests must be processed via some code on the server side, which
is generally referred to as server-side programming. Traditionally, server-side programming
has been performed using Perl, Python, C++, or some other language to create CGI
programs, but more sophisticated systems have since appeared. These include Java-based
Web servers that allow you to perform all your server-side programming in Java by writing
what are called servlets. Servlets and their offspring, JSPs, are two of the most compelling
reasons that companies that develop Web sites are moving to Java, especially because they
eliminate the problems of dealing with differently abled browsers. Server-side programming
topics are covered in Thinking in Enterprise Java at www.MindView.net.

Despite all this talk about Java on the Internet, it is a general-purpose programming
language that can solve the kinds of problems that you can solve with other languages. Here,
Java's strength is not only in its portability, but also its programmability, its robustness, its
large, standard library and the numerous third-party libraries that are available and that
continue to be developed.

## üçÄ03.14 Summary
You know what a procedural program looks like: data definitions and function calls. To find
the meaning of such a program, you must work at it, looking through the function calls and
low-level concepts to create a model in your mind. This is the reason we need intermediate
representations when designing procedural programs‚Äîby themselves, these programs tend
to be confusing because the terms of expression are oriented more toward the computer than
to the problem you're solving.

Because OOP adds many new concepts on top of what you find in a procedural language,
your natural assumption may be that the resulting Java program will be far more
complicated than the equivalent procedural program. Here, you'll be pleasantly surprised: A
well-written Java program is generally far simpler and much easier to understand than a
procedural program. What you'll see are the definitions of the objects that represent concepts
in your problem space (rather than the issues of the computer representation) and messages
sent to those objects to represent the activities in that space. One of the delights of object-
oriented programming is that, with a well-designed program, it's easy to understand the code
by reading it. Usually, there's a lot less code as well, because many of your problems will be
solved by reusing existing library code.

OOP and Java may not be for everyone. It's important to evaluate your own needs and decide
whether Java will optimally satisfy those needs, or if you might be better off with another
programming system (including the one you're currently using). If you know that your needs
will be very specialized for the foreseeable future and if you have specific constraints that
may not be satisfied by Java, then you owe it to yourself to investigate the alternatives (in
particular, I recommend looking at Python; see www.Python.org). If you still choose Java as
your language, you'll at least understand what the options were and have a clear vision of
why you took that direction.

# üìú 04. Everything Is an Object

‚ÄúIf we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat
different world.‚Äù
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)

Although it is based on C++, Java is more of a ‚Äúpure‚Äù object-oriented
language.

Both C++ and Java are hybrid languages, but in Java the designers felt that the hybridization
was not as important as it was in C++. A hybrid language allows multiple programming
styles; the reason C++ is hybrid is to support backward compatibility with the C language.
Because C++ is a superset of the C language, it includes many of that language's undesirable
features, which can make some aspects of C++ overly complicated.

The Java language assumes that you want to do only object-oriented programming. This
means that before you can begin you must shift your mindset into an object-oriented world
(unless it's already there). The benefit of this initial effort is the ability to program in a
language that is simpler to learn and to use than many other OOP languages. In this chapter
you'll see the basic components of a Java program and learn that (almost) everything in Java
is an object.

## üçÄ04.01 You manipulate objects with references
Each programming language has its own means of manipulating elements in memory.
Sometimes the programmer must be constantly aware of what type of manipulation is going
on. Are you manipulating the element directly, or are you dealing with some kind of indirect
representation (a pointer in C or C++) that must be treated with a special syntax?
All this is simplified in Java. You treat everything as an object, using a single consistent
syntax. Although you treat everything as an object, the identifier you manipulate is actually a
‚Äúreference‚Äù to an object. ¬π You might imagine a television (the object) and a remote control
(the reference). As long as you're holding this reference, you have a connection to the
television, but when someone says, ‚ÄúChange the channel‚Äù or ‚ÄúLower the volume,‚Äù what you're
manipulating is the reference, which in turn modifies the object. If you want to move around
the room and still control the television, you take the remote/reference with you, not the
television.

¬π This can be a flashpoint. There are those who say, ‚ÄúClearly, it's a pointer,‚Äù but 
this presumes an underlying implementation. Also, Java references are much more akin to 
C++ references than to pointers in their syntax. In the 1 st edition of this book, I chose 
to invent a new term, ‚Äúhandle,‚Äù because C++ references and Java references have some
important differences. I was coming out of C++ and did not want to confuse the C++ programmers whom I assumed would be the largest audience for Java. In the 2 nd edition, 
I decided that ‚Äúreference‚Äù was the more commonly used term, and that anyone changing from 
C++ would have a lot more to cope with than the terminology of references, so they might
as well jump in with both feet. However, there are people who disagree even with the term 
‚Äúreference.‚Äù I read in one book where it was ‚Äúcompletely wrong to say that Java supports 
pass by reference,‚Äù because Java object identifiers (according to that author) are actually 
‚Äúobject references.‚Äù And (he goes on) everything is actually pass by value. So you're not 
passing by reference, you're ‚Äúpassing an object reference by value.‚Äù One could argue for 
the precision of such convoluted explanations, but I think my approach simplifies the understanding
of the concept without hurting anything (well, the language lawyers may claim that I'm lying 
to you, but I'll say that I'm providing an appropriate abstraction).

Also, the remote control can stand on its own, with no television. That is, just because you
have a reference doesn't mean there's necessarily an object connected to it. So if you want to
hold a word or sentence, you create a String reference:

    String s;

But here you've created only the reference, not an object. If you decided to send a message to
s at this point, you'll get an error because s isn't actually attached to anything (there's no
television). A safer practice, then, is always to initialize a reference when you create it:

    String s = "asdf";

However, this uses a special Java feature: Strings can be initialized with quoted text.
Normally, you must use a more general type of initialization for objects.

## üçÄ04.02 You must create all the objects
When you create a reference, you want to connect it with a new object. You do so, in general,
with the new operator. The keyword new says, ‚ÄúMake me a new one of these objects.‚Äù So in
the preceding example, you can say:

    String s = new String("asdf");

Not only does this mean ‚ÄúMake me a new String,‚Äù but it also gives information about how to
make the String by supplying an initial character string.
Of course, Java comes with a plethora of ready-made types in addition to String. What's
more important is that you can create your own types. In fact, creating new types is the
fundamental activity in Java programming, and it's what you'll be learning about in the rest
of this book.

### ‚òò Where storage lives
It's useful to visualize some aspects of how things are laid out while the program is running‚Äî
in particular how memory is arranged. There are five different places to store data:
1. Registers. This is the fastest storage because it exists in a place different from that of
other storage: inside the processor. However, the number of registers is severely
limited, so registers are allocated as they are needed. You don't have direct control,
nor do you see any evidence in your programs that registers even exist (C & C++, on
the other hand, allow you to suggest register allocation to the compiler).

2. `The stack`. This lives in the general random-access memory (RAM) area, but has
direct support from the processor via its stack pointer. The stack pointer is moved
down to create new memory and moved up to release that memory. This is an
extremely fast and efficient way to allocate storage, second only to registers. The Java
system must know, while it is creating the program, the exact lifetime of all the items
that are stored on the stack. This constraint places limits on the flexibility of your
programs, so while some Java storage exists on the stack‚Äîin particular, object
references‚ÄîJava objects themselves are not placed on the stack.

3. `The heap`. This is a general-purpose pool of memory (also in the RAM area) where all
Java objects live. The nice thing about the heap is that, unlike the stack, the compiler
doesn't need to know how long that storage must stay on the heap. Thus, there's a
great deal of flexibility in using storage on the heap. Whenever you need an object, you
simply write the code to create it by using new, and the storage is allocated on the
heap when that code is executed. Of course there's a price you pay for this flexibility: It
may take more time to allocate and clean up heap storage than stack storage (if you
even could create objects on the stack in Java, as you can in C++).

4. `Constant storage`. Constant values are often placed directly in the program code,
which is safe since they can never change. Sometimes constants are cordoned off by
themselves so that they can be optionally placed in read-only memory (ROM), in
embedded systems. ¬≤

5. `Non-RAM storage`. If data lives completely outside a program, it can exist while the
program is not running, outside the control of the program. The two primary
examples of this are streamed objects, in which objects are turned into streams of
bytes, generally to be sent to another machine, and persistent objects, in which the
objects are placed on disk so they will hold their state even when the program is
terminated. The trick with these types of storage is turning the objects into something
that can exist on the other medium, and yet can be resurrected into a regular RAM-
based object when necessary. Java provides support for lightweight persistence, and
mechanisms such as JDBC and Hibernate provide more sophisticated support for
storing and retrieving object information in databases.

¬≤ An example of this is the string pool. All literal strings and string-valued constant 
expressions are interned automatically and put into special static storage.

### ‚òò Special case: primitive types
One group of types, which you'll use quite often in your programming, gets special treatment.
You can think of these as ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù types. The reason for the special treatment is that to
create an object with new‚Äîespecially a small, simple variable‚Äîisn't very efficient, because
new places objects on the heap. For these types Java falls back on the approach taken by C
and C++. That is, instead of creating the variable by using new, an ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù variable is
created that is not a reference. The variable holds the value directly, and it's placed on the
stack, so it's much more efficient.

Java determines the size of each primitive type. These sizes don't change from one machine
architecture to another as they do in most languages. This size invariance is one reason Java
programs are more portable than programs in most other languages.

| Primitive type  | Size | Minimum | Maximum | Wrapper type |
|-----------------|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| boolean  | ‚Äî       | ‚Äî         |  ‚Äî        | Boolean
| char     | 16 bits | Unicode 0 | Unicode 2^16 - 1 | Character
| byte     | 8 bits  | -128      | +127 Byte |
| short    | 16 bits | -2^15     | +2^15 -1  | Short
| int      | 32 bits | -2^31     | +2^31 -1  | Integer
| long     | 64 bits | -2^63     | +2^63 -1  | Long
| float    | 32 bits | IEEE754   | IEEE754   | Float
| double   | 64 bits | IEEE754   | IEEE754   | Double
| void     | ‚Äî       | ‚Äî         | ‚Äî         | Void

All numeric types are signed, so don't look for unsigned types.

The size of the boolean type is not explicitly specified; it is only defined to be able to take
the literal values true or false.

The ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù classes for the primitive data types allow you to make a non-primitive object
on the heap to represent that primitive type. For example:

    char c = 'x';
    Character ch = new Character(c);

Or you could also use:

    Character ch = new Character('x');

Java SE5 autoboxing will automatically convert from a primitive to a wrapper type:

    Character ch = 'x';

and back:

    char c = ch;

The reasons for wrapping primitives will be shown in a later chapter.

### ‚òò High-precision numbers
Java includes two classes for performing high-precision arithmetic: BigInteger and
BigDecimal. Although these approximately fit into the same category as the ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù
classes, neither one has a primitive analogue.

Both classes have methods that provide analogues for the operations that you perform on
primitive types. That is, you can do anything with a BigInteger or BigDecimal that you
can with an int or float, it's just that you must use method calls instead of operators. Also,
since there's more involved, the operations will be slower. You're exchanging speed for
accuracy.

BigInteger supports arbitrary-precision integers. This means that you can accurately
represent integral values of any size without losing any information during operations.
BigDecimal is for arbitrary-precision fixed-point numbers; you can use these for accurate
monetary calculations, for example.

Consult the JDK documentation for details about the constructors and methods you can call
for these two classes.

### ‚òò Arrays in Java
Virtually all programming languages support some kind of arrays. Using arrays in C and C++
is perilous because those arrays are only blocks of memory. If a program accesses the array
outside of its memory block or uses the memory before initialization (common programming
errors), there will be unpredictable results.

One of the primary goals of Java is safety, so many of the problems that plague programmers
in C and C++ are not repeated in Java. A Java array is guaranteed to be initialized and cannot
be accessed outside of its range. The range checking comes at the price of having a small
amount of memory overhead on each array as well as verifying the index at run time, but the
assumption is that the safety and increased productivity are worth the expense (and Java can
sometimes optimize these operations).

When you create an array of objects, you are really creating an array of references, and each
of those references is automatically initialized to a special value with its own keyword: null.
When Java sees null, it recognizes that the reference in question isn't pointing to an object.
You must assign an object to each reference before you use it, and if you try to use a reference
that's still null, the problem will be reported at run time. Thus, typical array errors are
prevented in Java.

You can also create an array of primitives. Again, the compiler guarantees initialization
because it zeroes the memory for that array.

Arrays will be covered in detail in later chapters.

## üçÄ04.03 You never need to destroy an object
In most programming languages, the concept of the lifetime of a variable occupies a
significant portion of the programming effort. How long does the variable last? If you are
supposed to destroy it, when should you? Confusion over variable lifetimes can lead to a lot
of bugs, and this section shows how Java greatly simplifies the issue by doing all the cleanup
work for you.

### ‚òò Scoping
Most procedural languages have the concept of scope. This determines both the visibility and
lifetime of the names defined within that scope. In C, C++, and Java, scope is determined by
the placement of curly braces {}. So for example:
```java
{
    int x = 12;
    // Only x available
    {
        int q = 96;
        // Both x & q available
    }
    // Only x available
    // q is "out of scope"
}
```
A variable defined within a scope is available only to the end of that scope.
Any text after a '//' to the end of a line is a comment.

Indentation makes Java code easier to read. Since Java is a free-form language, the extra
spaces, tabs, and carriage returns do not affect the resulting program.
You cannot do the following, even though it is legal in C and C++:

```java
{
    int x = 12;
    {
        int x = 96; // Illegal
    }
}
```

The compiler will announce that the variable x has already been defined. Thus the C and C++
ability to ‚Äúhide‚Äù a variable in a larger scope is not allowed, because the Java designers
thought that it led to confusing programs.

### ‚òò Scope of objects
Java objects do not have the same lifetimes as primitives. When you create a Java object
using new, it hangs around past the end of the scope. Thus if you use:

```java
{
    String s = new String("a string");
} // End of scope
```
the reference s vanishes at the end of the scope. However, the String object that s was
pointing to is still occupying memory. In this bit of code, there is no way to access the object
after the end of the scope, because the only reference to it is out of scope. In later chapters
you'll see how the reference to the object can be passed around and duplicated during the
course of a program.

It turns out that because objects created with new stay around for as long as you want them,
a whole slew of C++ programming problems simply vanish in Java. In C++ you must not only
make sure that the objects stay around for as long as you need them, you must also destroy
the objects when you're done with them.

That brings up an interesting question. If Java leaves the objects lying around, what keeps
them from filling up memory and halting your program? This is exactly the kind of problem
that would occur in C++. This is where a bit of magic happens. Java has a garbage collector,
which looks at all the objects that were created with new and figures out which ones are not
being referenced anymore. Then it releases the memory for those objects, so the memory can
be used for new objects. This means that you never need to worry about reclaiming memory
yourself. You simply create objects, and when you no longer need them, they will go away by
themselves. This eliminates a certain class of programming problem: the so-called ‚Äúmemory
leak,‚Äù in which a programmer forgets to release memory.


## üçÄ04.04 Creating new data types: class
If everything is an object, what determines how a particular class of object looks and
behaves? Put another way, what establishes the type of an object? You might expect there to
be a keyword called ‚Äútype,‚Äù and that certainly would have made sense. Historically, however,
most objectoriented languages have used the keyword class to mean ‚ÄúI'm about to tell you
what a new type of object looks like.‚Äù The class keyword (which is so common that it will not
usually be boldfaced throughout this book) is followed by the name of the new type. For
example:

    class ATypeName { /* Class body goes here */ }

This introduces a new type, although the class body consists only of a comment (the stars and
slashes and what is inside, which will be discussed later in this chapter), so there is not too
much that you can do with it. However, you can create an object of this type using new:

    ATypeName a = new ATypeName();

But you cannot tell it to do much of anything (that is, you cannot send it any interesting
messages) until you define some methods for it.

### ‚òò Fields and methods
When you define a class (and all you do in Java is define classes, make objects of those
classes, and send messages to those objects), you can put two types of elements in your class:
fields (sometimes called data members), and methods (sometimes called member functions).

A field is an object of any type that you can talk to via its reference, or a primitive type. If it is
a reference to an object, you must initialize that reference to connect it to an actual object
(using new, as seen earlier).

Each object keeps its own storage for its fields; ordinary fields are not shared among objects.
Here is an example of a class with some fields:
```java
class DataOnly {
    int i;
    double d;
    boolean b;
}
```
This class doesn't do anything except hold data. But you can create an object like this:

    DataOnly data = new DataOnly();

You can assign values to the fields, but you must first know how to refer to a member of an
object. This is accomplished by stating the name of the object reference, followed by a period
(dot), followed by the name of the member inside the object:

    objectReference.member

For example:

    data.i = 47;
    data.d = 1.1;
    data.b = false;

It is also possible that your object might contain other objects that contain data you'd like to
modify. For this, you just keep ‚Äúconnecting the dots.‚Äù For example:

    myPlane.leftTank.capacity = 100;

The DataOnly class cannot do much of anything except hold data, because it has no
methods. To understand how those work, you must first understand arguments and return
values, which will be described shortly.

### ‚òò Default values for primitive members
When a primitive data type is a member of a class, it is guaranteed to get a default value if
you do not initialize it:

    Primitive type    Default
    boolean           false
    char              '\u0000' (null)
    byte              (byte)0
    short             (short)0
    int               0
    long              0L
    float             0.0f
    double            0.0d

The default values are only what Java guarantees when the variable is used as a member of a
class. This ensures that member variables of primitive types will always be initialized
(something C++ doesn't do), reducing a source of bugs. However, this initial value may not
be correct or even legal for the program you are writing. It's best to always explicitly initialize
your variables.

This guarantee doesn't apply to local variables‚Äîthose that are not fields of a class. Thus, if
within a method definition you have:

    int x;

Then x will get some arbitrary value (as in C and C++); it will not automatically be initialized
to zero. You are responsible for assigning an appropriate value before you use x. If you forget,
Java definitely improves on C++: You get a compile-time error telling you the variable might
not have been initialized. (Many C++ compilers will warn you about uninitialized variables,
but in Java these are errors.)

## üçÄ04.05 Methods, arguments, and return values
In many languages (like C and C++), the term function is used to describe a named
subroutine. The term that is more commonly used in Java is method, as in ‚Äúa way to do
something.‚Äù If you want, you can continue thinking in terms of functions. It's really only a
syntactic difference, but this book follows the common Java usage of the term ‚Äúmethod.‚Äù
Methods in Java determine the messages an object can receive. The fundamental parts of a
method are the name, the arguments, the return type, and the body. Here is the basic form:

    ReturnType methodName( /* Argument list */ ) {
        /* Method body */
    }

The return type describes the value that comes back from the method after you call it. The
argument list gives the types and names for the information that you want to pass into the
method. The method name and argument list (which is called the signature of the method)
uniquely identify that method.

Methods in Java can be created only as part of a class. A method can be called only for an
object, ¬≥ and that object must be able to perform that method call. If you try to call the wrong
method for an object, you'll get an error message at compile time. You call a method for an
object by naming the object followed by a period (dot), followed by the name of the method
and its argument list, like this:

    objectName.methodName(arg1, arg2, arg3);

¬≥ static methods, which you'll learn about soon, can be called for the class, without an object.

For example, suppose you have a method f( ) that takes no arguments and returns a value of
type int. Then, if you have an object called a for which f( ) can be called, you can say this:

    int x = a.f();

The type of the return value must be compatible with the type of x. This act of calling a
method is commonly referred to as sending a message to an object. In the preceding
example, the message is f( ) and the object is a. Object-oriented programming is often
summarized as simply ‚Äúsending messages to objects.‚Äù

### ‚òò The argument list
The method argument list specifies what information you pass into the method. As you might
guess, this information‚Äîlike everything else in Java‚Äîtakes the form of objects. So, what you
must specify in the argument list are the types of the objects to pass in and the name to use
for each one. As in any situation in Java where you seem to be handing objects around, you
are actually passing references. 4 The type of the reference must be correct, however. If the
argument is supposed to be a String, you must pass in a String or the compiler will give an
error. Consider a method that takes a String as its argument. Here is the definition, which
must be placed within a class definition for it to be compiled:

    int storage(String s) {
        return s.length() * 2;
    }

This method tells you how many bytes are required to hold the information in a particular
String. (The size of each char in a String is 16 bits, or two bytes, to support Unicode
characters.) The argument is of type String and is called s. Once s is passed into the method,
you can treat it just like any other object. (You can send messages to it.) Here, the length( )
method is called, which is one of the methods for Strings; it returns the number of
characters in a string.

You can also see the use of the return keyword, which does two things. First, it means
‚ÄúLeave the method, I'm done.‚Äù Second, if the method produces a value, that value is placed
right after the return statement. In this case, the return value is produced by evaluating the
expression `s.length( ) * 2`.

You can return any type you want, but if you don't want to return anything at all, you do 
so by indicating that the method returns void. Here are some examples:
```java
boolean flag() { return true; }
double naturalLogBase() { return 2.718; }
void nothing() { return; }
void nothing2() {}
```

When the return type is void, then the return keyword is used only to exit the method, and
is therefore unnecessary when you reach the end of the method. You can return from a
method at any point, but if you've given a non-void return type, then the compiler will force
you (with error messages) to return the appropriate type of value regardless of where you
return.

At this point, it can look like a program is just a bunch of objects with methods that take
other objects as arguments and send messages to those other objects. That is indeed much of
what goes on, but in the following chapter you'll learn how to do the detailed low-level work
by making decisions within a method. For this chapter, sending messages will suffice.

## üçÄ04.06 Building a Java program
There are several other issues you must understand before seeing your first Java program.

### ‚òò Name visibility
A problem in any programming language is the control of names. If you use a name in one
module of the program, and another programmer uses the same name in another module,
how do you distinguish one name from another and prevent the two names from ‚Äúclashing‚Äù?
In C this is a particular problem because a program is often an unmanageable sea of names.
C++ classes (on which Java classes are based) nest functions within classes so they cannot
clash with function names nested within other classes. However, C++ still allows global data
and global functions, so clashing is still possible. To solve this problem, C++ introduced
namespaces using additional keywords.

Java was able to avoid all of this by taking a fresh approach. To produce an unambiguous
name for a library, the Java creators want you to use your Internet domain name in reverse
since domain names are guaranteed to be unique. Since my domain name is
MindView.net, my utility library of foibles would be named
net.mindview.utility.foibles. After your reversed domain name, the dots are intended to
represent subdirectories.

In Java 1.0 and Java 1.1 the domain extensions com, edu, org, net, etc., were capitalized by
convention, so the library would appear: NET.mindview.utility.foibles. Partway through
the development of Java 2, however, it was discovered that this caused problems, so now the
entire package name is lowercase.

This mechanism means that all of your files automatically live in their own namespaces, and
each class within a file must have a unique identifier‚Äîthe language prevents name clashes for
you.

### ‚òò Using other components
Whenever you want to use a predefined class in your program, the compiler must know how
to locate it. Of course, the class might already exist in the same source-code file that it's being
called from. In that case, you simply use the class‚Äîeven if the class doesn't get defined until
later in the file (Java eliminates the so-called ‚Äúforward referencing‚Äù problem).

What about a class that exists in some other file? You might think that the compiler should
be smart enough to simply go and find it, but there is a problem. Imagine that you want to
use a class with a particular name, but more than one definition for that class exists
(presumably these are different definitions). Or worse, imagine that you're writing a
program, and as you're building it you add a new class to your library that conflicts with the
name of an existing class.

To solve this problem, you must eliminate all potential ambiguities. This is accomplished by
telling the Java compiler exactly what classes you want by using the import keyword.
import tells the compiler to bring in a package, which is a library of classes. (In other
languages, a library could consist of functions and data as well as classes, but remember that
all code in Java must be written inside a class.)

Most of the time you'll be using components from the standard Java libraries that come with
your compiler. With these, you don't need to worry about long, reversed domain names; you
just say, for example:

    import java.util.ArrayList;

to tell the compiler that you want to use Java's ArrayList class. However, util contains a
number of classes, and you might want to use several of them without declaring them all
explicitly. This is easily accomplished by using `*` to indicate a wild card:

    import java.util.*;

It is more common to import a collection of classes in this manner than to import classes
individually.

### ‚òò The static keyword
Ordinarily, when you create a class you are describing how objects of that class look and how
they will behave. You don't actually get an object until you create one using new, and at that
point storage is allocated and methods become available.

There are two situations in which this approach is not sufficient. One is if you want to have
only a single piece of storage for a particular field, regardless of how many objects of that
class are created, or even if no objects are created. The other is if you need a method that isn't
associated with any particular object of this class. That is, you need a method that you can
call even if no objects are created.

You can achieve both of these effects with the static keyword. When you say something is
static, it means that particular field or method is not tied to any particular object instance of
that class. So even if you've never created an object of that class you can call a static method
or access a static field. With ordinary, non-static fields and methods, you must create an
object and use that object to access the field or method, since non-static fields and methods
must know the particular object they are working with. ‚Å¥

‚Å¥ Of course, since static methods don't need any objects to be created before they are used, 
they cannot directly access non-static members or methods by simply calling those other members
without referring to a named object (since non-static members and methods must be tied to a 
particular object).

Some object-oriented languages use the terms class data and class methods, meaning that
the data and methods exist only for the class as a whole, and not for any particular objects of
the class. Sometimes the Java literature uses these terms too.

To make a field or method static, you simply place the keyword before the definition. For
example, the following produces a static field and initializes it:
```java
class StaticTest {
    static int i = 47;
}
```
Now even if you make two StaticTest objects, there will still be only one piece of storage for
StaticTest.i. Both objects will share the same i. Consider:

    StaticTest st1 = new StaticTest();
    StaticTest st2 = new StaticTest();

At this point, both st1.i and st2.i have the same value of 47 since they refer to the same 
piece of memory.

There are two ways to refer to a static variable. As the preceding example indicates, you can
name it via an object, by saying, for example, st2.i. You can also refer to it directly through
its class name, something you cannot do with a non-static member.

    StaticTest.i++;

The ++ operator adds one to the variable. At this point, both st1.i and st2.i will have the
value 48.

Using the class name is the preferred way to refer to a static variable. Not only does it
emphasize that variable's static nature, but in some cases it gives the compiler better
opportunities for optimization.

Similar logic applies to static methods. You can refer to a static method either through an
object as you can with any method, or with the special additional syntax
ClassName.method( ). You define a static method in a similar way:
```java
class Incrementable {
    static void increment() { StaticTest.i++; }
}
```
You can see that the Incrementable method increment( ) increments the static data i
using the ++ operator. You can call increment( ) in the typical way, through an object:

    Incrementable sf = new Incrementable();
    sf.increment();

Or, because increment( ) is a static method, you can call it directly through its class:

    Incrementable.increment();

Although static, when applied to a field, definitely changes the way the data is created (one
for each class versus the non-static one for each object), when applied to a method it's not so
dramatic. An important use of static for methods is to allow you to call that method without
creating an object. This is essential, as you will see, in defining the main( ) method that is
the entry point for running an application.

## üçÄ04.07 Your first Java program
Finally, here's the first complete program. It starts by printing a string, and then the date,
using the Date class from the Java standard library.
```java
// HelloDate.java
import java.util.*;
public class HelloDate {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, it's: ");
        System.out.println(new Date());
    }
}
```

At the beginning of each program file, you must place any necessary import statements to
bring in extra classes you'll need for the code in that file. Note that I say ‚Äúextra‚Äù. That's
because there's a certain library of classes that are automatically brought into every Java file:
java.lang. Start up your Web browser and look at the documentation from Sun. (If you
haven't downloaded the JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com, do so now. ‚Åµ Note
that this documentation doesn't come packed with the JDK; you must do a separate
download to get it.) If you look at the list of the packages, you'll see all the different class
libraries that come with Java. Select java.lang. This will bring up a list of all the classes that
are part of that library. Since java.lang is implicitly included in every Java code file, these
classes are automatically available. There's no Date class listed in java.lang, which means
you must import another library to use that. If you don't know the library where a particular
class is, or if you want to see all of the classes, you can select ‚ÄúTree‚Äù in the Java
documentation. Now you can find every single class that comes with Java. Then you can use
the browser's ‚Äúfind‚Äù function to find Date. When you do you'll see it listed as
java.util.Date, which lets you know that it's in the util library and that you must import
java.util.* in order to use Date.

‚Åµ The Java compiler and documentation from Sun tend to change regularly, and the best place 
to get them is directly from Sun. By downloading it yourself, you will get the most recent version.

If you go back to the beginning, select java.lang and then System, you'll see that the
System class has several fields, and if you select out, you'll discover that it's a static
PrintStream object. Since it's static, you don't need to create anything with new. The out
object is always there, and you can just use it. What you can do with this out object is
determined by its type: PrintStream. Conveniently, PrintStream is shown in the
description as a hyperlink, so if you click on that, you'll see a list of all the methods you can
call for PrintStream. There are quite a few, and these will be covered later in the book. For
now all we're interested in is println( ), which in effect means ‚ÄúPrint what I'm giving you
out to the console and end with a newline.‚Äù Thus, in any Java program you write you can
write something like this:

    System.out.println("A String of things");

whenever you want to display information to the console.
The name of the class is the same as the name of the file. When you're creating a standalone
program such as this one, one of the classes in the file must have the same name as the file.
(The compiler complains if you don't do this.) That class must contain a method called
main( ) with this signature and return type:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

The public keyword means that the method is available to the outside world (described in
detail in the Access Control chapter). The argument to main( ) is an array of String objects.
The args won't be used in this program, but the Java compiler insists that they be there
because they hold the arguments from the command line.
The line that prints the date is quite interesting:

    System.out.println(new Date());

The argument is a Date object that is being created just to send its value (which is
automatically converted to a String) to println( ). As soon as this statement is finished,
that Date is unnecessary, and the garbage collector can come along and get it anytime. We
don't need to worry about cleaning it up.

When you look at the JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com, you will see that
System has many other methods that allow you to produce interesting effects (one of Java's
most powerful assets is its large set of standard libraries). For example:

```java
//: object/ShowProperties.java
public class ShowProperties {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.getProperties().list(System.out);
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
        System.out.println(
            System.getProperty("java.library.path"));
    }
} ///:~
```
The first line in main( ) displays all of the ‚Äúproperties‚Äù from the system where you are
running the program, so it gives you environment information. The list( ) method sends the
results to its argument, System.out. You will see later in the book that you can send the
results elsewhere, to a file, for example. You can also ask for a specific property‚Äîin this case,
the user name and java.library.path. (The unusual comments at the beginning and end
will be explained a little later.)

### ‚òò Compiling and running
To compile and run this program, and all the other programs in this book, you must first
have a Java programming environment. There are a number of third-party development
environments, but in this book I will assume that you are using the Java Developer's Kit
(JDK) from Sun, which is free. If you are using another development system, ‚Å∂ you will need
to look in the documentation for that system to determine how to compile and run programs.
Get on the Internet and go to http://java.sun.com. There you will find information and links
that will lead you through the process of downloading and installing the JDK for your
particular platform.

‚Å∂ IBM's ‚Äújikes‚Äù compiler is a common alternative, as it is significantly faster than Sun's 
javac (although if you're building groups of files using Ant, there's not too much of a 
difference). There are also open-source projects to create Java compilers, runtime environments, 
and libraries.

Once the JDK is installed, and you've set up your computer's path information so that it will
find javac and java, download and unpack the source code for this book (you can find it at
www.MindView.net). This will create a subdirectory for each chapter in this book. Move to
the subdirectory named objects and type:

    javac HelloDate.java

This command should produce no response. If you get any kind of an error message, it means
you haven't installed the JDK properly and you need to investigate those problems.
On the other hand, if you just get your command prompt back, you can type:

    java HelloDate

and you'll get the message and the date as output.

This is the process you can use to compile and run each of the programs in this book.
However, you will see that the source code for this book also has a file called build.xml in
each chapter, and this contains ‚ÄúAnt‚Äù commands for automatically building the files for that

chapter. Buildfiles and Ant (including where to download it) are described more fully in the
supplement you will find at http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava, but once you have Ant
installed (from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant) you can just type 'ant' at the command
prompt to compile and run the programs in each chapter. If you haven't installed Ant yet, you
can just type the javac and java commands by hand.

## üçÄ04.08 Comments and embedded documentation
There are two types of comments in Java. The first is the traditional C-style comment that
was inherited by C++. These comments begin with a `/*` and continue, possibly across many
lines, until a `*/`. Note that many programmers will begin each line of a continued comment
with a * , so you'll often see:

    /* This is a comment
    * that continues
    * across lines
    */

Remember, however, that everything inside the `/*` and `*/` is ignored, so there's no difference in saying:

    /* This is a comment that
    continues across lines */

The second form of comment comes from C++. It is the single-line comment, which starts
with a // and continues until the end of the line. This type of comment is convenient and
commonly used because it's easy. You don't need to hunt on the keyboard to find / and then *
(instead, you just press the same key twice), and you don't need to close the comment. So you
will often see:

    // This is a one-line comment

### ‚òò Comment documentation
Possibly the biggest problem with documenting code has been maintaining that
documentation. If the documentation and the code are separate, it becomes tedious to
change the documentation every time you change the code. The solution seems simple: Link
the code to the documentation. The easiest way to do this is to put everything in the same file.
To complete the picture, however, you need a special comment syntax to mark the
documentation and a tool to extract those comments and put them in a useful form. This is
what Java has done.

The tool to extract the comments is called Javadoc, and it is part of the JDK installation. It
uses some of the technology from the Java compiler to look for special comment tags that you
put in your programs. It not only extracts the information marked by these tags, but it also
pulls out the class name or method name that adjoins the comment. This way you can get
away with the minimal amount of work to generate decent program documentation.

The output of Javadoc is an HTML file that you can view with your Web browser. Thus,
Javadoc allows you to create and maintain a single source file and automatically generate
useful documentation. Because of Javadoc, you have a straightforward standard for creating
documentation, so you can expect or even demand documentation with all Java libraries.

In addition, you can write your own Javadoc handlers, called doclets, if you want to perform
special operations on the information processed by Javadoc (to produce output in a different
format, for example). Doclets are introduced in the supplement at
http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava.

What follows is only an introduction and overview of the basics of Javadoc. A thorough
description can be found in the JDK documentation. When you unpack the documentation,
look in the ‚Äútooldocs‚Äù subdirectory (or follow the ‚Äútooldocs‚Äù link).

### ‚òò Syntax
All of the Javadoc commands occur only within `/**` comments. The comments end with `*/` as
usual. There are two primary ways to use Javadoc: Embed HTML or use ‚Äúdoc tags.‚Äù
Standalone doc tags are commands that start with an '@' and are placed at the beginning of
a comment line. (A leading `*`, however, is ignored.) Inline doc tags can appear anywhere
within a Javadoc comment and also start with an '@' but are surrounded by curly braces.
There are three ‚Äútypes‚Äù of comment documentation, which correspond to the element the
comment precedes: class, field, or method. That is, a class comment appears right before the
definition of a class, a field comment appears right in front of the definition of a field, and a
method comment appears right in front of the definition of a method. As a simple example:

```java
//: object/Documentation1.java
/** A class comment */
public class Documentation1 {
    /** A field comment */
    public int i;
    /** A method comment */
    public void f() {}
} ///:~
```
Note that Javadoc will process comment documentation for only public and protected
members. Comments for private and package-access members (see the Access Control
chapter) are ignored, and you'll see no output. (However, you can use the -private flag to
include private members as well.) This makes sense, since only public and protected
members are available outside the file, which is the client programmer's perspective.
The output for the preceding code is an HTML file that has the same standard format as all
the rest of the Java documentation, so users will be comfortable with the format and can
easily navigate your classes. It's worth entering the preceding code, sending it through
Javadoc, and viewing the resulting HTML file to see the results.

### ‚òò Embedded HTML
Javadoc passes HTML commands through to the generated HTML document. This allows
you full use of HTML; however, the primary motive is to let you format code, such as:

```java
//: object/Documentation2.java
/**
* <pre>
* System.out.println(new Date());
* </pre>
*/
///:~
```
You can also use HTML just as you would in any other Web document to format the regular
text in your descriptions:

```java
//: object/Documentation3.java
/**
* You can <em>even</em> insert a list:
* <ol>
* <li> Item one
* <li> Item two
* <li> Item three
* </ol>
*/
///:~
```
Note that within the documentation comment, asterisks at the beginning of a line are thrown
away by Javadoc, along with leading spaces. Javadoc reformats everything so that it
conforms to the standard documentation appearance. Don't use headings such as <h1> or
<hr> as embedded HTML, because Javadoc inserts its own headings and yours will interfere
with them.

All types of comment documentation‚Äîclass, field, and method‚Äîcan support embedded
HTML.

### ‚òò Some example tags
Here are some of the Javadoc tags available for code documentation. Before trying to do
anything serious using Javadoc, you should consult the Javadoc reference in the JDK
documentation to learn all the different ways that you can use Javadoc.

@see
This tag allows you to refer to the documentation in other classes. Javadoc will generate
HTML with the @see tags hyperlinked to the other documentation. The forms are:

@see classname

@see fully-qualified-classname

@see fully-qualified-classname#method-name
Each one adds a hyperlinked ‚ÄúSee Also‚Äù entry to the generated documentation. Javadoc will
not check the hyperlinks you give it to make sure they are valid.

{@link package.class#member label}
Very similar to @see, except that it can be used inline and uses the label as the hyperlink text
rather than ‚ÄúSee Also.‚Äù

{@docRoot}
Produces the relative path to the documentation root directory. Useful for explicit
hyperlinking to pages in the documentation tree.

{@inheritDoc}
Inherits the documentation from the nearest base class of this class into the current doc
comment.

@version
This is of the form:

@version version-information
in which version-information is any significant information you see fit to include. When
the - version flag is placed on the Javadoc command line, the version information will be
called out specially in the generated HTML documentation.

@author
This is of the form:

    @author author-information

in which author-information is, presumably, your name, but it could also include your
email address or any other appropriate information. When the -author flag is placed on the
Javadoc command line, the author information will be called out specially in the generated
HTML documentation.

You can have multiple author tags for a list of authors, but they must be placed consecutively.
All the author information will be lumped together into a single paragraph in the generated
HTML.

@since
This tag allows you to indicate the version of this code that began using a particular feature.
You'll see it appearing in the HTML Java documentation to indicate what version of the JDK
is used.

@param
This is used for method documentation, and is of the form:

@param parameter-name description
in which parameter-name is the identifier in the method parameter list, and description
is text that can continue on subsequent lines. The description is considered finished when a
new documentation tag is encountered. You can have any number of these, presumably one
for each parameter.

@return
This is used for method documentation, and looks like this:

@return description
in which description gives you the meaning of the return value. It can continue on
subsequent lines.

@throws
Exceptions will be demonstrated in the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter. Briefly,
they are objects that can be ‚Äúthrown‚Äù out of a method if that method fails. Although only one
exception object can emerge when you call a method, a particular method might produce any
number of different types of exceptions, all of which need descriptions. So the form for the
exception tag is:

    @throws fully-qualified-class-name description

in which fully-qualified-class-name gives an unambiguous name of an exception class that's
defined somewhere, and description (which can continue on subsequent lines) tells you why
this particular type of exception can emerge from the method call.

@deprecated
This is used to indicate features that were superseded by an improved feature. The
deprecated tag is a suggestion that you no longer use this particular feature, since sometime
in the future it is likely to be removed. A method that is marked @deprecated causes the
compiler to issue a warning if it is used. In Java SE5, the @deprecated Javadoc tag has
been superseded by the @Deprecated annotation (you'll learn about these in the
Annotations chapter).

### ‚òò Documentation example
Here is the first Java program again, this time with documentation comments added:

```java
//: object/HelloDate.java
import java.util.*;

/** The first Thinking in Java example program.
* Displays a string and today's date.
* @author Bruce Eckel
* @author www.MindView.net
* @version 4.0
*/
public class HelloDate {
    /** Entry point to class & application.
    * @param args array of string arguments
    * @throws exceptions No exceptions thrown
    */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, it's: ");
        System.out.println(new Date());
    }
} /* Output: (55% match)
Hello, it's:
Wed Oct 05 14:39:36 MDT 2005
*///:~
```
The first line of the file uses my own technique of putting a '//:' as a special marker for the
comment line containing the source file name. That line contains the path information to the
file (object indicates this chapter) followed by the file name. The last line also finishes with a
comment, and this one ('///:~') indicates the end of the source code listing, which allows it to
be automatically updated into the text of this book after being checked with a compiler and
executed.

The /* Output: tag indicates the beginning of the output that will be generated by this file.
In this form, it can be automatically tested to verify its accuracy. In this case, the (55%
match) indicates to the testing system that the output will be fairly different from one run to
the next so it should only expect a 55 percent correlation with the output shown here. Most
examples in this book that produce output will contain the output in this commented form,
so you can see the output and know that it is correct.

## üçÄ04.09 Coding style
The style described in the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language ‚Å∑ is to
capitalize the first letter of a class name. If the class name consists of several words, they are
run together (that is, you don't use underscores to separate the names), and the first letter of
each embedded word is capitalized, such as:

    class AllTheColorsOfTheRainbow { // ...

This is sometimes called ‚Äúcamel-casing.‚Äù For almost everything else‚Äîmethods, fields
(member variables), and object reference names‚Äîthe accepted style is just as it is for classes
except that the first letter of the identifier is lowercase. For example:
```java
class AllTheColorsOfTheRainbow {
    int anIntegerRepresentingColors;
    void changeTheHueOfTheColor(int newHue) {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```
The user must also type all these long names, so be merciful.
The Java code you will see in the Sun libraries also follows the placement of open-and-close
curly braces that you see used in this book.

‚Å∑ http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/index.html. To preserve space in this book and seminar 
presentations, not all of these guidelines could be followed, but you'll see that the style I 
use here matches the Java standard as much as possible.

## üçÄ04.10 Summary
The goal of this chapter is just enough Java to understand how to write a simple program.
You've also gotten an overview of the language and some of its basic ideas. However, the
examples so far have all been of the form ‚ÄúDo this, then do that, then do something else.‚Äù The
next two chapters will introduce the basic operators used in Java programming, and then
show you how to control the flow of your program.

Exercises
Normally, exercises will be distributed throughout the chapters, but in this chapter you were
learning how to write basic programs so all the exercises were delayed until the end.
The number in parentheses after each exercise number is an indicator of how difficult the
exercise is, in a ranking from 1-10.

Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java 
Annotated Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a class containing an int and a char that are not initialized, and
print their values to verify that Java performs default initialization.

Exercise 2: (1) Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, create a ‚Äúhello,
world‚Äù program that simply displays that statement. You need only a single method in your
class (the ‚Äúmain‚Äù one that gets executed when the program starts). Remember to make it
static and to include the argument list, even though you don't use the argument list. Compile
the program with javac and run it using java. If you are using a different development
environment than the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.

Exercise 3: (1) Find the code fragments involving ATypeName and turn them into a
program that compiles and runs.

Exercise 4: (1) Turn the DataOnly code fragments into a program that compiles and
runs.

Exercise 5: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that the values of the data in DataOnly
are assigned to and printed in main( ).

Exercise 6: (2) Write a program that includes and calls the storage( ) method defined
as a code fragment in this chapter.

Exercise 7: (1) Turn the Incrementable code fragments into a working program.

Exercise 8: (3) Write a program that demonstrates that, no matter how many objects
you create of a particular class, there is only one instance of a particular static field in that
class.

Exercise 9: (2) Write a program that demonstrates that autoboxing works for all the
primitive types and their wrappers.

Exercise 10: (2) Write a program that prints three arguments taken from the command
line. To do this, you'll need to index into the command-line array of Strings.

Exercise 11: (1) Turn the AllTheColorsOfTheRainbow example into a program that
compiles and runs.

Exercise 12: (2) Find the code for the second version of HelloDate.java, which is the
simple comment documentation example. Execute Javadoc on the file and view the results
with your Web browser.

Exercise 13: (1) Run Documentation1.java, Documentation2.java, and
Documentation3.java through Javadoc. Verify the resulting documentation with your
Web browser.

Exercise 14: (1) Add an HTML list of items to the documentation in the previous
exercise.

Exercise 15: (1) Take the program in Exercise 2 and add comment documentation to it.
Extract this comment documentation into an HTML file using Javadoc and view it with
your Web browser.

Exercise 16: (1) In the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, locate the Overloading.java
example and add Javadoc documentation. Extract this comment documentation into an
HTML file using Javadoc and view it with your Web browser.

# üìú 05. Operators
At the lowest level, data in Java is manipulated using operators.
Because Java was inherited from C++, most of these operators will be familiar to C and C++
programmers. Java has also added some improvements and simplifications.

If you're familiar with C or C++ syntax, you can skim through this chapter and the next,
looking for places where Java is different from those languages. However, if you find yourself
floundering a bit in these two chapters, make sure you go through the multimedia seminar
Thinking in C, freely downloadable from www.MindView.net. It contains audio lectures,
slides, exercises, and solutions specifically designed to bring you up to speed with the
fundamentals necessary to learn Java.

## üçÄ05.01 Simpler print statements
In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the Java print statement:

    System.out.println("Rather a lot to type");

You may observe that this is not only a lot to type (and thus many redundant tendon hits),
but also rather noisy to read. Most languages before and after Java have taken a much
simpler approach to such a commonly used statement.

The Access Control chapter introduces the concept of the static import that was added to
Java SE5, and creates a tiny library to simplify writing print statements. However, you don't
need to know those details in order to begin using that library. We can rewrite the program
from the last chapter using this new library:

```java
//: operators/HelloDate.java
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class HelloDate {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Hello, it's: ");
        print(new Date());
    }
} /* Output: (55% match)
Hello, it's:
Wed Oct 05 14:39:05 MDT 2005
*///:~
```
The results are much cleaner. Notice the insertion of the static keyword in the second
import statement.

In order to use this library, you must download this book's code package from
www.MindView.net or one of its mirrors. Unzip the code tree and add the root directory of
that code tree to your computer's CLASSPATH environment variable. (You'll eventually get a
full introduction to the classpath, but you might as well get used to struggling with it early.
Alas, it is one of the more common battles you will have with Java.)

Although the use of net.mindview.util.Print nicely simplifies most code, it is not
justifiable everywhere. If there are only a small number of print statements in a program, I
forego the import and write out the full System.out.println( ).

Exercise 1: (1) Write a program that uses the ‚Äúshort‚Äù and normal form of print
statement.

## üçÄ05.02 Using Java operators
An operator takes one or more arguments and produces a new value. The arguments are in a
different form than ordinary method calls, but the effect is the same. Addition and unary plus
(+), subtraction and unary minus (-), multiplication (`*`), division (/), and assignment (=) all
work much the same in any programming language.

All operators produce a value from their operands. In addition, some operators change the
value of an operand. This is called a side effect. The most common use for operators that
modify their operands is to generate the side effect, but you should keep in mind that the
value produced is available for your use, just as in operators without side effects.
Almost all operators work only with primitives. The exceptions are '=', '==' and '!=', which
work with all objects (and are a point of confusion for objects). In addition, the String class
supports '+' and '+='.

## üçÄ05.03 Precedence
Operator precedence defines how an expression evaluates when several operators are
present. Java has specific rules that determine the order of evaluation. The easiest one to
remember is that multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

Programmers often forget the other precedence rules, so you should use parentheses to make
the order of evaluation explicit. For example, look at statements (1) and (2):

```java
//: operators/Precedence.java

public class Precedence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
        int a = x + y - 2/2 + z; // (1)
        int b = x + (y - 2)/(2 + z); // (2)
        System.out.println("a = " + a + " b = " + b);
    }
} /* Output:
a = 5 b = 1
*///:~
```
These statements look roughly the same, but from the output you can see that they have very
different meanings which depend on the use of parentheses.

Notice that the System.out.println( ) statement involves the '+' operator. In this context,
'+' means ‚Äústring concatenation‚Äù and, if necessary, ‚Äústring conversion.‚Äù When the compiler
sees a String followed by a '+' followed by a non-String, it attempts to convert the non-
String into a String. As you can see from the output, it successfully converts from int into
String for a and b.

## üçÄ05.04 Assignment
Assignment is performed with the operator =. It means ‚ÄúTake the value of the right-hand side
(often called the rvalue) and copy it into the left-hand side (often called the lvalue)‚Äù. An
rvalue is any constant, variable, or expression that produces a value, but an lvalue must be a
distinct, named variable. (That is, there must be a physical space to store the value.) For
instance, you can assign a constant value to a variable:

    a = 4;

but you cannot assign anything to a constant value‚Äîit cannot be an lvalue. (You can't say 4 =
a;.)
Assignment of primitives is quite straightforward. Since the primitive holds the actual value
and not a reference to an object, when you assign primitives, you copy the contents from one
place to another. For example, if you say a = b for primitives, then the contents of b are
copied into a. If you then go on to modify a, b is naturally unaffected by this modification. As
a programmer, this is what you can expect for most situations.

When you assign objects, however, things change. Whenever you manipulate an object, what
you're manipulating is the reference, so when you assign ‚Äúfrom one object to another,‚Äù you're
actually copying a reference from one place to another. This means that if you say c = d for
objects, you end up with both c and d pointing to the object that, originally, only d pointed
to. Here's an example that demonstrates this behavior:

```java
//: operators/Assignment.java
// Assignment with objects is a bit tricky.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Tank {
    int level;
}

public class Assignment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Tank t1 = new Tank();
        Tank t2 = new Tank();
        t1.level = 9;
        t2.level = 47;
        print("1: t1.level: " + t1.level +
            ", t2.level: " + t2.level);
        t1 = t2;
        print("2: t1.level: " + t1.level +
            ", t2.level: " + t2.level);
        t1.level = 27;
        print("3: t1.level: " + t1.level +
            ", t2.level: " + t2.level);
    }
}
/* Output:
1: t1.level: 9, t2.level: 47
2: t1.level: 47, t2.level: 47
3: t1.level: 27, t2.level: 27
*/ //:~
```
The Tank class is simple, and two instances (t1 and t2) are created within main( ). The
level field within each Tank is given a different value, and then t2 is assigned to t1, and t1 is
changed. In many programming languages you expect t1 and t2 to be independent at all
times, but because you've assigned a reference, changing the t1 object appears to change the
t2 object as well! This is because both t1 and t2 contain the same reference, which is
pointing to the same object. (The original reference that was in t1, that pointed to the object
holding a value of 9, was overwritten during the assignment and effectively lost; its object
will be cleaned up by the garbage collector.)

This phenomenon is often called aliasing, and it's a fundamental way that Java works with
objects. But what if you don't want aliasing to occur in this case? You could forego the
assignment and say:

    t1.level = t2.level;

This retains the two separate objects instead of discarding one and tying t1 and t2 to the
same object. You'll soon realize that manipulating the fields within objects is messy and goes
against good object-oriented design principles. This is a nontrivial topic, so you should keep
in mind that assignment for objects can add surprises.

Exercise 2: (1) Create a class containing a float and use it to demonstrate aliasing.

### ‚òò Aliasing during method calls
Aliasing will also occur when you pass an object into a method:

```java
//: operators/PassObject.java
// Passing objects to methods may not be
// what you're used to.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Letter {
    char c;
}

public class PassObject {
    static void f(Letter y) {
        y.c = 'z';
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Letter x = new Letter();
        x.c = 'a';
        print("1: x.c: " + x.c);
        f(x);
        print("2: x.c: " + x.c);
    }
}
/* Output:
1: x.c: a
2: x.c: z
*/ //:~
```
In many programming languages, the method f( ) would appear to be making a copy of its
argument Letter y inside the scope of the method. But once again a reference is being
passed, so the line

    y.c = 'z';

is actually changing the object outside of f( ).
Aliasing and its solution is a complex issue which is covered in one of the online supplements
for this book. However, you should be aware of it at this point so you can watch for pitfalls.

Exercise 3: (1) Create a class containing a float and use it to demonstrate aliasing
during method calls.

## üçÄ05.05 Mathematical operators
The basic mathematical operators are the same as the ones available in most programming
languages: addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), multiplication (`*`) and modulus (%,
which produces the remainder from integer division). Integer division truncates, rather than
rounds, the result.

Java also uses the shorthand notation from C/C++ that performs an operation and an
assignment at the same time. This is denoted by an operator followed by an equal sign, and is
consistent with all the operators in the language (whenever it makes sense). For example, to
add 4 to the variable x and assign the result to x, use: x += 4.

This example shows the use of the mathematical operators:

```java
//: operators/MathOps.java
// Demonstrates the mathematical operators.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class MathOps {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a seeded random number generator:
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        int i, j, k;
        // Choose value from 1 to 100:
        j = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;
        print("j : " + j);
        k = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;
        print("k : " + k);
        i = j + k;
        print("j + k : " + i);
        i = j - k;
        print("j - k : " + i);
        i = k / j;
        print("k / j : " + i);
        i = k * j;
        print("k * j : " + i);
        i = k % j;
        print("k % j : " + i);
        j %= k;
        print("j %= k : " + j);
        // Floating-point number tests:
        float u, v, w; // Applies to doubles, too
        v = rand.nextFloat();
        print("v : " + v);
        w = rand.nextFloat();
        print("w : " + w);
        u = v + w;
        print("v + w : " + u);
        u = v - w;
        print("v - w : " + u);
        u = v * w;
        print("v * w : " + u);
        u = v / w;
        print("v / w : " + u);
        // The following also works for char,
        // byte, short, int, long, and double:
        u += v;
        print("u += v : " + u);
        u -= v;
        print("u -= v : " + u);
        u *= v;
        print("u *= v : " + u);
        u /= v;
        print("u /= v : " + u);
    }
}
/* Output:
j : 59

*/ //:~
```
To generate numbers, the program first creates a Random object. If you create a Random
object with no arguments, Java uses the current time as a seed for the random number
generator, and will thus produce different output for each execution of the program.

However, in the examples in this book, it is important that the output shown at the end of the
examples be as consistent as possible, so that this output can be verified with external tools.
By providing a seed (an initialization value for the random number generator that will always
produce the same sequence for a particular seed value) when creating the Random object,
the same random numbers will be generated each time the program is executed, so the
output is verifiable. 1 To generate more varying output, feel free to remove the seed in the
examples in the book.

The program generates a number of different types of random numbers with the Random
object simply by calling the methods nextInt( ) and nextFloat( ) (you can also call
nextLong( ) or nextDouble( )). The argument to nextInt( ) sets the upper bound on the
generated number. The lower bound is zero, which we don't want because of the possibility of
a divide-by-zero, so the result is offset by one.

Exercise 4: (2) Write a program that calculates velocity using a constant distance and a
constant time.

### ‚òò Unary minus and plus operators
The unary minus (-) and unary plus (+) are the same operators as binary minus and plus.
The compiler figures out which use is intended by the way you write the expression. For
instance, the statement

1 The number 47 was considered a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù at a college I attended, and it stuck.

    x = -a;

has an obvious meaning. The compiler is able to figure out:

    x = a * -b;

but the reader might get confused, so it is sometimes clearer to say:

    x = a * (-b);

Unary minus inverts the sign on the data. Unary plus provides symmetry with unary minus,
although it doesn't have any effect.

## üçÄ05.06 Auto increment and decrement
Java, like C, has a number of shortcuts. Shortcuts can make code much easier to type, and
either easier or harder to read.

Two of the nicer shortcuts are the increment and decrement operators (often referred to as
the auto-increment and auto-decrement operators). The decrement operator is -- and means
‚Äúdecrease by one unit.‚Äù The increment operator is ++ and means ‚Äúincrease by one unit.‚Äù
If a is an int, for example, the expression ++a is equivalent to (a = a + 1). Increment and
decrement operators not only modify the variable, but also produce the value of the variable
as a result.

There are two versions of each type of operator, often called the prefix and postfix versions.
Preincrement means the ++ operator appears before the variable, and post-increment
means the ++ operator appears after the variable. Similarly, pre-decrement means the --
operator appears before the variable, and post-decrement means the -- operator appears
after the variable. For pre-increment and pre-decrement (i.e., ++a or --a), the operation is
performed and the value is produced. For post-increment and post-decrement (i.e., a++ or
a--), the value is produced, then the operation is performed. As an example:

```java
//: operators/AutoInc.java
// Demonstrates the ++ and -- operators.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class AutoInc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        print("i : " + i);
        print("++i : " + ++i); // Pre-increment
        print("i++ : " + i++); // Post-increment
        print("i : " + i);
        print("--i : " + --i); // Pre-decrement
        print("i-- : " + i--); // Post-decrement
        print("i : " + i);
    }
}/* Output:
i : 1
++i : 2
i++ : 2
i : 3
--i : 2
i-- : 2
i : 1
*///:~
```
You can see that for the prefix form, you get the value after the operation has been
performed, but with the postfix form, you get the value before the operation is performed.
These are the only operators, other than those involving assignment, that have side effects‚Äî
they change the operand rather than using just its value.

The increment operator is one explanation for the name C++, implying ‚Äúone step beyond C.‚Äù
In an early Java speech, Bill Joy (one of the Java creators), said that ‚ÄúJava=C++--‚Äù 
(C plus plus minus minus), suggesting that Java is C++ with the unnecessary hard parts removed,
and therefore a much simpler language. As you progress in this book, you'll see that many
parts are simpler, and yet in other ways Java isn't much easier than C++.

## üçÄ05.07 Relational operators
Relational operators generate a boolean result. They evaluate the relationship between the
values of the operands. A relational expression produces true if the relationship is true, and
false if the relationship is untrue. The relational operators are less than (<), greater than
(>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), equivalent (==) and not
equivalent (!=). Equivalence and nonequivalence work with all primitives, but the other
comparisons won't work with type boolean. Because boolean values can only be true or
false, ‚Äúgreater than‚Äù and ‚Äúless than‚Äù doesn't make sense.

### ‚òò Testing object equivalence
The relational operators == and != also work with all objects, but their meaning often
confuses the first-time Java programmer. Here's an example:

```java
//: operators/Equivalence.java

public class Equivalence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer n1 = new Integer(47);
        Integer n2 = new Integer(47);
        System.out.println(n1 == n2);
        System.out.println(n1 != n2);
    }
} /* Output:
false
true
*///:~
```
The statement System.out.println(n1 == n2) will print the result of the boolean
comparison within it. Surely the output should be ‚Äútrue‚Äù and then ‚Äúfalse,‚Äù since both Integer
objects are the same. But while the contents of the objects are the same, the references are
not the same. The operators == and != compare object references, so the output is actually
‚Äúfalse‚Äù and then ‚Äútrue.‚Äù Naturally, this surprises people at first.

What if you want to compare the actual contents of an object for equivalence? You must use
the special method equals( ) that exists for all objects (not primitives, which work fine with
== and !=). Here's how it's used:

```java
//: operators/EqualsMethod.java
public class EqualsMethod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer n1 = new Integer(47);
        Integer n2 = new Integer(47);
        System.out.println(n1.equals(n2));
    }
}/* Output:
true
*///:~
```
The result is now what you expect. Ah, but it's not as simple as that. If you create your own
class, like this:

```java
//: operators/EqualsMethod2.java
// Default equals() does not compare contents.

class Value {
    int i;
}

public class EqualsMethod2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Value v1 = new Value();
        Value v2 = new Value();
        v1.i = v2.i = 100;
        System.out.println(v1.equals(v2));
    }
} /* Output:
false
*///:~
```
things are confusing again: The result is false. This is because the default behavior of
equals( ) is to compare references. So unless you override equals( ) in your new class you
won't get the desired behavior. Unfortunately, you won't learn about overriding until the
Reusing Classes chapter and about the proper way to define equals( ) until the Containers
in Depth chapter, but being aware of the way equals( ) behaves might save you some grief in
the meantime.

Most of the Java library classes implement equals( ) so that it compares the contents of
objects instead of their references.

Exercise 5: (2) Create a class called Dog containing two Strings: name and says. In
main( ), create two dog objects with names ‚Äúspot‚Äù (who says, ‚ÄúRuff!‚Äù) and ‚Äúscruffy‚Äù
(who says, ‚ÄúWurf!‚Äù). Then display their names and what they say.

Exercise 6: (3) Following Exercise 5, create a new Dog reference and assign it to spot's
object. Test for comparison using == and equals( ) for all references.

## üçÄ05.08 Logical operators
Each of the logical operators AND (&&), OR (||) and NOT (!) produces a boolean value of
true or false based on the logical relationship of its arguments. This example uses the
relational and logical operators:

```java
//: operators/Bool.java
// Relational and logical operators.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Bool {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        int i = rand.nextInt(100);
        int j = rand.nextInt(100);
        print("i = " + i);
        print("j = " + j);
        print("i > j is " + (i > j));
        print("i < j is " + (i < j));
        print("i >= j is " + (i >= j));
        print("i <= j is " + (i <= j));
        print("i == j is " + (i == j));
        print("i != j is " + (i != j));
        // Treating an int as a boolean is not legal Java:
        //! print("i && j is " + (i && j));
        //! print("i || j is " + (i || j));
        //! print("!i is " + !i);
        print("(i < 10) && (j < 10) is " +
            ((i < 10) && (j < 10)));
        print("(i < 10) || (j < 10) is " +
            ((i < 10) || (j < 10)));
    }
} /* Output:
i = 58
j = 55
i > j is true
i < j is false
i >= j is true
i <= j is false
i == j is false
i != j is true
(i < 10) && (j < 10) is false
(i < 10) || (j < 10) is false
*///:~
```
You can apply AND, OR, or NOT to boolean values only. You can't use a non-boolean as if
it were a boolean in a logical expression as you can in C and C++. You can see the failed
attempts at doing this commented out with a '//!' (this comment syntax enables automatic
removal of comments to facilitate testing). The subsequent expressions, however, produce
boolean values using relational comparisons, then use logical operations on the results.

Note that a boolean value is automatically converted to an appropriate text form if it is used
where a String is expected.

You can replace the definition for int in the preceding program with any other primitive data
type except boolean. Be aware, however, that the comparison of floating point numbers is
very strict. A number that is the tiniest fraction different from another number is still ‚Äúnot
equal.‚Äù A number that is the tiniest bit above zero is still nonzero.

Exercise 7: (3) Write a program that simulates coin-flipping.

### ‚òò Short-circuiting
When dealing with logical operators, you run into a phenomenon called ‚Äúshort-circuiting.‚Äù
This means that the expression will be evaluated only until the truth or falsehood of the
entire expression can be unambiguously determined. As a result, the latter parts of a logical
expression might not be evaluated. Here's an example that demonstrates short-circuiting:

```java
//: operators/ShortCircuit.java
// Demonstrates short-circuiting behavior
// with logical operators.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ShortCircuit {
    static boolean test1(int val) {
        print("test1(" + val + ")");
        print("result: " + (val < 1));
        return val < 1;
    }
    static boolean test2(int val) {
        print("test2(" + val + ")");
        print("result: " + (val < 2));
        return val < 2;
    }
    static boolean test3(int val) {
        print("test3(" + val + ")");
        print("result: " + (val < 3));
        return val < 3;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean b = test1(0) && test2(2) && test3(2);
        print("expression is " + b);
    }
}/* Output:
test1(0)
result: true
test2(2)
result: false
expression is false
*///:~
```
Each test performs a comparison against the argument and returns true or false. It also
prints information to show you that it's being called. The tests are used in the expression:

    test1(0) && test2(2) && test3(2)

You might naturally think that all three tests would be executed, but the output shows
otherwise. The first test produced a true result, so the expression evaluation continues.
However, the second test produced a false result. Since this means that the whole expression
must be false, why continue evaluating the rest of the expression? It might be expensive. The
reason for shortcircuiting, in fact, is that you can get a potential performance increase if all
the parts of a logical expression do not need to be evaluated.

## üçÄ05.09 Literals
Ordinarily, when you insert a literal value into a program, the compiler knows exactly what
type to make it. Sometimes, however, the type is ambiguous. When this happens, you must
guide the compiler by adding some extra information in the form of characters associated
with the literal value. The following code shows these characters:

```java
//: operators/Literals.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;
public class Literals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i1 = 0x2f; // Hexadecimal (lowercase)
        print("i1: " + Integer.toBinaryString(i1));
        int i2 = 0X2F; // Hexadecimal (uppercase)
        print("i2: " + Integer.toBinaryString(i2));
        int i3 = 0177; // Octal (leading zero)
        print("i3: " + Integer.toBinaryString(i3));
        char c = 0xffff; // max char hex value
        print("c: " + Integer.toBinaryString(c));
        byte b = 0x7f; // max byte hex value
        print("b: " + Integer.toBinaryString(b));
        short s = 0x7fff; // max short hex value
        print("s: " + Integer.toBinaryString(s));
        long n1 = 200 L; // long suffix
        long n2 = 200 l; // long suffix (but can be confusing)
        long n3 = 200;
        float f1 = 1;
        float f2 = 1 F; // float suffix
        float f3 = 1 f; // float suffix
        double d1 = 1 d; // double suffix
        double d2 = 1 D; // double suffix
        // (Hex and Octal also work with long)
    }
} /* Output:
i1: 101111
i2: 101111
i3: 1111111
c: 1111111111111111
b: 1111111
s: 111111111111111
*///:~
```
A trailing character after a literal value establishes its type. Uppercase or lowercase L means
long (however, using a lowercase l is confusing because it can look like the number one).
Uppercase or lowercase F means float. Uppercase or lowercase D means double.

Hexadecimal (base 16), which works with all the integral data types, is denoted by a leading
0x or 0X followed by 0-9 or a-f either in uppercase or lowercase. If you try to initialize a
variable with a value bigger than it can hold (regardless of the numerical form of the value),
the compiler will give you an error message. Notice in the preceding code the maximum
possible hexadecimal values for char, byte, and short. If you exceed these, the compiler will
automatically make the value an int and tell you that you need a narrowing cast for the
assignment (casts are defined later in this chapter). You'll know you've stepped over the line.
Octal (base 8) is denoted by a leading zero in the number and digits from 0-7.

There is no literal representation for binary numbers in C, C++, or Java. However, when
working with hexadecimal and octal notation, it's useful to display the binary form of the
results. This is easily accomplished with the static toBinaryString( ) methods from the
Integer and Long classes. Notice that when passing smaller types to
Integer.toBinaryString( ), the type is automatically converted to an int.

Exercise 8: (2) Show that hex and octal notations work with long values. Use
Long.toBinaryString( ) to display the results.

### ‚òò Exponential notation
Exponents use a notation that I've always found rather dismaying:

```java
//: operators/Exponents.java
// "e" means "10 to the power."

public class Exponents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Uppercase and lowercase 'e' are the same:
        float expFloat = 1.39e-43 f;
        expFloat = 1.39E-43 f;
        System.out.println(expFloat);
        double expDouble = 47e47 d; // 'd' is optional
        double expDouble2 = 47e47; // Automatically double
        System.out.println(expDouble);
    }
} /* Output:
1.39E-43
4.7E48
*///:~
```
In science and engineering, 'e' refers to the base of natural logarithms, approximately 2.718.
(A more precise double value is available in Java as Math.E.) This is used in exponentiation
expressions such as 1.39 x e -43 , which means 1.39 x 2.718 -43 . However, when the 
FORTRAN programming language was invented, they decided that e would mean ‚Äúten to the power‚Äù,
which is an odd decision because FORTRAN was designed for science and engineering, and
one would think its designers would be sensitive about introducing such an ambiguity. ¬≤ At
any rate, this custom was followed in C, C++ and now Java. So if you're used to thinking in
terms of e as the base of natural logarithms, you must do a mental translation when you see
an expression such as 1.39 e-43f in Java; it means 1.39 x 10 -43 .

Note that you don't need to use the trailing character when the compiler can figure out the
appropriate type. With

    long n3 = 200;

there's no ambiguity, so an L after the 200 would be superfluous. However, with

    float f4 = 1e-43f; // 10 to the power

the compiler normally takes exponential numbers as doubles, so without the trailing f, it will
give you an error telling you that you must use a cast to convert double to float.

Exercise 9: (1) Display the largest and smallest numbers for both float and double
exponential notation.

¬≤ John Kirkham writes, ‚ÄúI started computing in 1962 using FORTRAN II on an IBM 1620. 
At that time, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, FORTRAN was an all uppercase 
language. This probably started because many of the early input devices were old teletype units 
that used 5 bit Baudot code, which had no lowercase capability. The 'E' in the exponential 
notation was also always uppercase and was never confused with the natural logarithm base 'e', which is always lowercase. The 'E' simply stood for exponential, which was for the base of 
the number system used‚Äîusually 10. At the time octal was also widely used by programmers. 
Although I never saw it used, if I had seen an octal number in exponential notation I would 
have considered it to be base 8. The first time I remember seeing an exponential using a 
lowercase 'e' was in the late 1970s and I also found it confusing. The problem arose as 
lowercase crept into FORTRAN, not at its beginning. We actually had functions to use if you 
really wanted to use the natural logarithm base, but they were all uppercase.‚Äù

## üçÄ05.10 Bitwise operators
The bitwise operators allow you to manipulate individual bits in an integral primitive data
type. Bitwise operators perform Boolean algebra on the corresponding bits in the two
arguments to produce the result.

The bitwise operators come from C's low-level orientation, where you often manipulate
hardware directly and must set the bits in hardware registers. Java was originally designed to
be embedded in TV set-top boxes, so this low-level orientation still made sense. However,
you probably won't use the bitwise operators much.

The bitwise AND operator (&) produces a one in the output bit if both input bits are one;
otherwise, it produces a zero. The bitwise OR operator (|) produces a one in the output bit if
either input bit is a one and produces a zero only if both input bits are zero. The bitwise
EXCLUSIVE OR, or XOR (^), produces a one in the output bit if one or the other input bit is
a one, but not both. The bitwise NOT (~, also called the ones complement operator) is a
unary operator; it takes only one argument. (All other bitwise operators are binary
operators.) Bitwise NOT produces the opposite of the input bit‚Äîa one if the input bit is zero,
a zero if the input bit is one.

The bitwise operators and logical operators use the same characters, so it is helpful to have a
mnemonic device to help you remember the meanings: Because bits are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, there is only
one character in the bitwise operators.

Bitwise operators can be combined with the = sign to unite the operation and assignment:
&=, |= and ^= are all legitimate. (Since ~ is a unary operator, it cannot be combined with
the = sign.)

The boolean type is treated as a one-bit value, so it is somewhat different. You can perform
a bitwise AND, OR, and XOR, but you can't perform a bitwise NOT (presumably to prevent
confusion with the logical NOT). For booleans, the bitwise operators have the same effect as
the logical operators except that they do not short circuit. Also, bitwise operations on
booleans include an XOR logical operator that is not included under the list of ‚Äúlogical‚Äù
operators. You cannot use booleans in shift expressions, which are described next.

Exercise 10: (3) Write a program with two constant values, one with alternating binary
ones and zeroes, with a zero in the least-significant digit, and the second, also alternating,
with a one in the least-significant digit (hint: It's easiest to use hexadecimal constants for
this). Take these two values and combine them in all possible ways using the bitwise
operators, and display the results using Integer.toBinaryString( ).

## üçÄ05.11 Shift operators
The shift operators also manipulate bits. They can be used solely with primitive, integral
types. The left-shift operator (<<) produces the operand to the left of the operator after it has
been shifted to the left by the number of bits specified to the right of the operator (inserting
zeroes at the lower-order bits). The signed right-shift operator (>>) produces the operand to
the left of the operator after it has been shifted to the right by the number of bits specified to
the right of the operator. The signed right shift >> uses sign extension: If the value is
positive, zeroes are inserted at the higher-order bits; if the value is negative, ones are inserted
at the higher-order bits. Java has also added the unsigned right shift >>>, which uses zero
extension: Regardless of the sign, zeroes are inserted at the higher-order bits. This operator
does not exist in C or C++.

**If you shift a char, byte, or short, it will be promoted to int before the shift takes place**, and
the result will be an int. Only the five low-order bits of the right-hand side will be used. This
prevents you from shifting more than the number of bits in an int. If you're operating on a
long, you'll get a long result. Only the six low-order bits of the right-hand side will be used,
so you can't shift more than the number of bits in a long.

Shifts can be combined with the equal sign (<<= or >>= or >>>=). The lvalue is replaced by
the lvalue shifted by the rvalue. There is a problem, however, with the unsigned right shift
combined with assignment. If you use it with byte or short, you don't get the correct results.
Instead, these are promoted to int and right shifted, but then truncated as they are assigned
back into their variables, so you get -1 in those cases. The following example demonstrates
this:

```java
//: operators/URShift.java
// Test of unsigned right shift.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class URShift {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = -1;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(i));
        i >>>= 10;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(i));
        long l = -1;
        print(Long.toBinaryString(l));
        l >>>= 10;
        print(Long.toBinaryString(l));
        short s = -1;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(s));
        s >>>= 10;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(s));
        byte b = -1;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(b));
        b >>>= 10;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(b));
        b = -1;
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(b));
        print(Integer.toBinaryString(b>>>10));
    }
} /* Output:

In the last shift, the resulting value is not assigned back into b, but is printed directly, so the
correct behavior occurs.

The two methods at the end, printBinaryInt( ) and printBinaryLong( ), take an int or a
long, respectively, and print it out in binary format along with a descriptive string. As well as
demonstrating the effect of all the bitwise operators for int and long, this example also
shows the minimum, maximum, +1, and -1 values for int and long so you can see what they
look like. Note that the high bit represents the sign: 0 means positive and 1 means negative.
The output for the int portion is displayed above.

The binary representation of the numbers is referred to as signed twos complement.
Exercise 11: (3) Start with a number that has a binary one in the most significant
position (hint: Use a hexadecimal constant). Using the signed right-shift operator, right shift
it all the way through all of its binary positions, each time displaying the result using
Integer.toBinaryString( ).

Exercise 12: (3) Start with a number that is all binary ones. Left shift it, then use the
unsigned right-shift operator to right shift through all of its binary positions, each time
displaying the result using Integer.toBinaryString( ).

Exercise 13: (1) Write a method that displays char values in binary form. Demonstrate
it using several different characters.

## üçÄ05.12 Ternary if-else operator
The ternary operator, also called the conditional operator, is unusual because it has three
operands. It is truly an operator because it produces a value, unlike the ordinary if-else
statement that you'll see in the next section of this chapter. The expression is of the form:

    boolean-exp ? value0 : value1

If boolean-exp evaluates to true, value0 is evaluated, and its result becomes the value
produced by the operator. If boolean-exp is false, value1 is evaluated and its result becomes
the value produced by the operator.

Of course, you could use an ordinary if-else statement (described later), but the ternary
operator is much terser. Although C (where this operator originated) prides itself on being a
terse language, and the ternary operator might have been introduced partly for efficiency,
you should be somewhat wary of using it on an everyday basis‚Äîit's easy to produce
unreadable code.

The conditional operator is different from if-else because it produces a value. Here's an
example comparing the two:

```java
//: operators/TernaryIfElse.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class TernaryIfElse {
    static int ternary(int i) {
        return i < 10 ? i * 100 : i * 10;
    }
    static int standardIfElse(int i) {
        if (i < 10)
            return i * 100;
        else
            return i * 10;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(ternary(9));
        print(ternary(10));
        print(standardIfElse(9));
        print(standardIfElse(10));
    }
} /* Output:
900
100
900
100
*///:~
```
You can see that this code in ternary( ) is more compact than what you'd need to write
without the ternary operator, in standardIfElse( ). However, standardIfElse( ) is easier
to understand, and doesn't require a lot more typing. So be sure to ponder your reasons when
choosing the ternary operator‚Äîit's generally warranted when you're setting a variable to one
of two values.

## üçÄ05.13 String operator + and +=
There's one special usage of an operator in Java: The + and += operators can be used to
concatenate strings, as you've already seen. It seems a natural use of these operators even
though it doesn't fit with the traditional way that they are used.

This capability seemed like a good idea in C++, so operator overloading was added to C++ to
allow the C++ programmer to add meanings to almost any operator. Unfortunately, operator
overloading combined with some of the other restrictions in C++ turns out to be a fairly
complicated feature for programmers to design into their classes. Although operator
overloading would have been much simpler to implement in Java than it was in C++ (as has
been demonstrated in the C# language, which does have straightforward operator
overloading), this feature was still considered too complex, so Java programmers cannot
implement their own overloaded operators like C++ and C# programmers can.

The use of the String operators has some interesting behavior. If an expression begins with a
String, then all operands that follow must be Strings (remember that the compiler
automatically turns a double-quoted sequence of characters into a String):

```java
//: operators/StringOperators.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class StringOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 0, y = 1, z = 2;
        String s = "x, y, z ";
        print(s + x + y + z);
        print(x + " " + s); // Converts x to a String
        s += "(summed) = "; // Concatenation operator
        print(s + (x + y + z));
        print("" + x); // Shorthand for Integer.toString()
    }
}/* Output:
x, y, z 012
0 x, y, z
x, y, z (summed) = 3
0
*///:~
```
Note that the output from the first print statement is 'o12' instead of just '3', which is what
you'd get if it was summing the integers. This is because the Java compiler converts x, y, and
z into their String representations and concatenates those strings, instead of adding them
together first. The second print statement converts the leading variable into a String, so the
string conversion does not depend on what comes first. Finally, you see the use of the +=
operator to append a string to s, and the use of parentheses to control the order of evaluation
of the expression so that the ints are actually summed before they are displayed.

Notice the last example in main( ): you will sometimes see an empty String followed by a +
and a primitive as a way to perform the conversion without calling the more cumbersome
explicit method (Integer.toString( ), in this case).

## üçÄ05.14 Common pitfalls when using operators
One of the pitfalls when using operators is attempting to leave out the parentheses when you
are even the least bit uncertain about how an expression will evaluate. This is still true in
Java.

An extremely common error in C and C++ looks like this:

    while(x = y) {
        // ....
    }

The programmer was clearly trying to test for equivalence (==) rather than do an
assignment. In C and C++ the result of this assignment will always be true if y is nonzero,
and you'll probably get an infinite loop. In Java, the result of this expression is not a
boolean, but the compiler expects a boolean and won't convert from an int, so it will
conveniently give you a compile-time error and catch the problem before you ever try to run
the program. So the pitfall never happens in Java. (The only time you won't get a compile-
time error is when x and y are boolean, in which case x = y is a legal expression, and in the
preceding example, probably an error.)

A similar problem in C and C++ is using bitwise AND and OR instead of the logical versions.
Bitwise AND and OR use one of the characters (& or |) while logical AND and OR use two
(&& and ||). Just as with = and ==, it's easy to type just one character instead of two. In
Java, the compiler again prevents this, because it won't let you cavalierly use one type where
it doesn't belong.

## üçÄ05.15 Casting operators
The word cast is used in the sense of ‚Äúcasting into a mold.‚Äù Java will automatically change
one type of data into another when appropriate. For instance, if you assign an integral value
to a floating point variable, the compiler will automatically convert the int to a float. Casting
allows you to make this type conversion explicit, or to force it when it wouldn't normally
happen.
To perform a cast, put the desired data type inside parentheses to the left of any value. You
can see this in the following example:

```java
//: operators/Casting.java

public class Casting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 200;
        long lng = (long) i;
        lng = i; // "Widening," so cast not really required
        long lng2 = (long) 200;
        lng2 = 200;
        // A "narrowing conversion":
        i = (int) lng2; // Cast required
    }
} ///:~
```
As you can see, it's possible to perform a cast on a numeric value as well as on a variable.
Notice that you can introduce superfluous casts; for example, the compiler will automatically
promote an int value to a long when necessary. However, you are allowed to use superfluous
casts to make a point or to clarify your code. In other situations, a cast may be essential just
to get the code to compile.

In C and C++, casting can cause some headaches. In Java, casting is safe, with the exception
that when you perform a so-called narrowing conversion (that is, when you go from a data
type that can hold more information to one that doesn't hold as much), you run the risk of
losing information. Here the compiler forces you to use a cast, in effect saying, ‚ÄúThis can be a
dangerous thing to do‚Äîif you want me to do it anyway you must make the cast explicit.‚Äù With
a widening conversion an explicit cast is not needed, because the new type will more than
hold the information from the old type so that no information is ever lost.

Java allows you to cast any primitive type to any other primitive type, except for boolean,
which doesn't allow any casting at all. Class types do not allow casting. To convert one to the
other, there must be special methods. (You'll find out later in this book that objects can be
cast within a family of types; an Oak can be cast to a Tree and vice versa, but not to a
foreign type such as a Rock.)

### ‚òò Truncation and rounding
When you are performing narrowing conversions, you must pay attention to issues of
truncation and rounding. For example, if you cast from a floating point value to an integral
value, what does Java do? For example, if you have the value 29.7 and you cast it to an int, is
the resulting value 30 or 29? The answer to this can be seen in this example:

```java
//: operators/CastingNumbers.java
// What happens when you cast a float
// or double to an integral value?
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class CastingNumbers {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double above = 0.7, below = 0.4;
float fabove = 0.7f, fbelow = 0.4f;
print("(int)above: " + (int)above);
print("(int)below: " + (int)below);
print("(int)fabove: " + (int)fabove);
 print("(int)fbelow: " + (int)fbelow);
}
} /* Output:
(int)above: 0
(int)below: 0
(int)fabove: 0
(int)fbelow: 0
*///:~
```
So the answer is that casting from a float or double to an integral value always truncates
the number. If instead you want the result to be rounded, use the round( ) methods in
java.lang.Math:

```java
//: operators/RoundingNumbers.java
// Rounding floats and doubles.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class RoundingNumbers {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double above = 0.7, below = 0.4;
float fabove = 0.7f, fbelow = 0.4f;
print("Math.round(above): " + Math.round(above));
print("Math.round(below): " + Math.round(below));
print("Math.round(fabove): " + Math.round(fabove));
print("Math.round(fbelow): " + Math.round(fbelow));
}
} /* Output:
Math.round(above): 1
Math.round(below): 0
Math.round(fabove): 1
Math.round(fbelow): 0
*///:~
```
Since the round( ) is part of java.lang, you don't need an extra import to use it.

### ‚òò Promotion
You'll discover that if you perform any mathematical or bitwise operations on primitive data
types that are smaller than an int (that is, char, byte, or short), those values will be
promoted to int before performing the operations, and the resulting value will be of type int.
So if you want to assign back into the smaller type, you must use a cast. (And, since you're
assigning back into a smaller type, you might be losing information.) In general, the largest
data type in an expression is the one that determines the size of the result of that expression;
if you multiply a float and a double, the result will be double; if you add an int and a
long, the result will be long.

## üçÄ05.16 Java has no ‚Äúsizeof‚Äù
In C and C++, the sizeof( ) operator tells you the number of bytes allocated for data items.
The most compelling reason for sizeof( ) in C and C++ is for portability. Different data types
might be different sizes on different machines, so the programmer must discover how big
those types are when performing operations that are sensitive to size. For example, one
computer might store integers in 32 bits, whereas another might store integers as 16 bits.
Programs could store larger values in integers on the first machine. As you might imagine,
portability is a huge headache for C and C++ programmers.

Java does not need a sizeof( ) operator for this purpose, because all the data types are the
same size on all machines. You do not need to think about portability on this level‚Äîit is
designed into the language.

## üçÄ05.17 A compendium of operators
The following example shows which primitive data types can be used with particular
operators. Basically, it is the same example repeated over and over, but using different
primitive data types. The file will compile without error because the lines that fail are
commented out with a //!.

```java
//: operators/AllOps.java
// Tests all the operators on all the primitive data types
// to show which ones are accepted by the Java compiler.
public class AllOps {
    // To accept the results of a boolean test:
    void f(boolean b) {}
    void boolTest(boolean x, boolean y) {
        // Arithmetic operators:
        //! x = x * y;
        //! x = x / y;
        //! x = x % y;
        //! x = x + y;
        //! x = x - y;
        //! x++;
        //! x--;
        //! x = +y;
        //! x = -y;
        // Relational and logical:

        //! f(x >= y);
        //! f(x < y);

Note that boolean is quite limited. You can assign to it the values true and false, and you
can test it for truth or falsehood, but you cannot add booleans or perform any other type of
operation on them.

In char, byte, and short, you can see the effect of promotion with the arithmetic operators.
Each arithmetic operation on any of those types produces an int result, which must be
explicitly cast back to the original type (a narrowing conversion that might lose information)
to assign back to that type. With int values, however, you do not need to cast, because
everything is already an int. Don't be lulled into thinking everything is safe, though. If you
multiply two ints that are big enough, you'll overflow the result. The following example
demonstrates this:

```java
//: operators/Overflow.java
// Surprise! Java lets you overflow.

public class Overflow {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("big = " + big);
        int bigger = big * 4;
        System.out.println("bigger = " + bigger);
    }
}/* Output:
big = 2147483647
bigger = -4
*///:~
```
You get no errors or warnings from the compiler, and no exceptions at run time. Java is good,
but it's not that good.

Compound assignments do not require casts for char, byte, or short, even though they are
performing promotions that have the same results as the direct arithmetic operations. On the
other hand, the lack of the cast certainly simplifies the code.

You can see that, with the exception of boolean, any primitive type can be cast to any other
primitive type. Again, you must be aware of the effect of a narrowing conversion when
casting to a smaller type; otherwise, you might unknowingly lose information during the cast.

Exercise 14: (3) Write a method that takes two String arguments and uses all the
boolean comparisons to compare the two Strings and print the results. For the == and !=,
also perform the equals( ) test. In main( ), call your method with some different String
objects.

## üçÄ05.18 Summary
If you've had experience with any languages that use C-like syntax, you can see that the
operators in Java are so similar that there is virtually no learning curve. If you found this
chapter challenging, make sure you view the multimedia presentation Thinking in C,
available at www.MindView.net.

Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java 
Annotated Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net.

# üìú 06. Controlling Execution
Like a sentient creature, a program must manipulate its world and
make choices during execution. In Java you make choices with
execution control statements.

Java uses all of C's execution control statements, so if you've programmed with C or C++,
then most of what you see will be familiar. Most procedural programming languages have
some kind of control statements, and there is often overlap among languages. In Java, the
keywords include if-else, while, do-while, for, return, break, and a selection statement
called switch. Java does not, however, support the much-maligned goto (which can still be
the most expedient way to solve certain types of problems). You can still do a goto-like jump,
but it is much more constrained than a typical goto.

## üçÄ06.01 true and false
All conditional statements use the truth or falsehood of a conditional expression to determine
the execution path. An example of a conditional expression is `a == b`. This uses the
conditional operator == to see if the value of a is equivalent to the value of b. The expression
returns `true` or `false`. Any of the relational operators you've seen in the previous chapter can
be used to produce a conditional statement. Note that Java doesn't allow you to use a number
as a boolean, even though it's allowed in C and C++ (where truth is nonzero and falsehood
is zero). If you want to use a non-boolean in a boolean test, such as `if(a)`, you must first
convert it to a boolean value by using a conditional expression, such as `if(a != 0)`.

## üçÄ06.02 if-else
The if-else statement is the most basic way to control program flow. The else is optional, so
you can use if in two forms:

    if(Boolean-expression)
    statement

or

    if(Boolean-expression)
        statement
    else
        statement

The Boolean-expression must produce a boolean result. The statement is either a simple
statement terminated by a semicolon, or a compound statement, which is a group of simple
statements enclosed in braces. Whenever the word ‚Äústatement‚Äù is used, it always implies that
the statement can be simple or compound.

As an example of if-else, here is a test( ) method that will tell you whether a guess is above,
below, or equivalent to a target number:

```java
//: control/IfElse.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class IfElse {

    static int result = 0;
    static void test(int testval, int target) {
        if (testval > target)
            result = +1;
        else if (testval < target)
            result = -1;
        else
            result = 0; // Match
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(10, 5);
        print(result);
        test(5, 10);
        print(result);
        test(5, 5);
        print(result);
    }
}/* Output:
1
-1
0
*///:~
```
In the middle of test( ), you'll also see an ‚Äúelse if,‚Äù which is not a new keyword but just an
else followed by a new if statement.

Although Java, like C and C++ before it, is a ‚Äúfree-form‚Äù language, it is conventional to indent
the body of a control flow statement so the reader can easily determine where it begins and
ends.

## üçÄ06.03 Iteration
Looping is controlled by while, do-while and for, which are sometimes classified as
iteration statements. A statement repeats until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates
to false. The form for a while loop is:

    while(Boolean-expression)
    statement

The Boolean-expression is evaluated once at the beginning of the loop and again before each
further iteration of the statement.

Here's a simple example that generates random numbers until a particular condition is met:

```java
//: control/WhileTest.java
// Demonstrates the while loop.

public class WhileTest {
    static boolean condition() {
        boolean result = Math.random() < 0.99;
        System.out.print(result + ", ");
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while (condition())
            System.out.println("Inside 'while'");
        System.out.println("Exited 'while'");
    }
} /* (Execute to see output) */ //:~
```
The condition( ) method uses the static method random( ) in the Math library, which
generates a double value between 0 and 1. (It includes 0, but not 1.) The result value comes
from the comparison operator <, which produces a boolean result. If you print a boolean
value, you automatically get the appropriate string ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù The conditional
expression for the while says: ‚Äúrepeat the statements in the body as long as condition( )
returns true.‚Äù

### ‚òò do-while
The form for do-while is

    do
    statement
    while(Boolean-expression);

The sole difference between while and do-while is that the statement of the do-while
always executes at least once, even if the expression evaluates to false the first time. In a
while, if the conditional is false the first time the statement never executes. In practice, do-
while is less common than while.

### ‚òò for
A for loop is perhaps the most commonly used form of iteration. This loop performs
initialization before the first iteration. Then it performs conditional testing and, at the end of
each iteration, some form of ‚Äústepping.‚Äù The form of the for loop is:

    for(initialization; Boolean-expression; step)
    statement

Any of the expressions initialization, Boolean-expression or step can be empty. The
expression is tested before each iteration, and as soon as it evaluates to false, execution will
continue at the line following the for statement. At the end of each loop, the step executes.
for loops are usually used for ‚Äúcounting‚Äù tasks:

```java
//: control/ListCharacters.java
// Demonstrates "for" loop by listing
// all the lowercase ASCII letters.
public class ListCharacters {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (char c = 0; c < 128; c++)
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c))
                System.out.println("value: " + (int) c + " character: " + c);
    }
} /* Output:
value: 97 character: a
value: 98 character: b
value: 99 character: c
value: 100 character: d
value: 101 character: e
value: 102 character: f
value: 103 character: g
value: 104 character: h
value: 105 character: i
value: 106 character: j
...
*///:~
```
Note that the variable c is defined at the point where it is used, inside the control expression
of the for loop, rather than at the beginning of main( ). The scope of c is the statement
controlled by the for.

This program also uses the java.lang.Character ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù class, which not only wraps the
primitive char type in an object, but also provides other utilities. Here, the static
isLowerCase( ) method is used to detect whether the character in question is a lowercase
letter.

Traditional procedural languages like C require that all variables be defined at the beginning
of a block so that when the compiler creates a block, it can allocate space for those variables.
In Java and C++, you can spread your variable declarations throughout the block, defining
them at the point that you need them. This allows a more natural coding style and makes
code easier to understand.

Exercise 1: (1) Write a program that prints values from 1 to 100.

Exercise 2: (2) Write a program that generates 25 random int values. For each value,
use an if-else statement to classify it as greater than, less than, or equal to a second
randomly generated value.

Exercise 3: (1) Modify Exercise 2 so that your code is surrounded by an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù while
loop. It will then run until you interrupt it from the keyboard (typically by pressing Control-
C).

Exercise 4: (3) Write a program that uses two nested for loops and the modulus
operator (%) to detect and print prime numbers (integral numbers that are not evenly
divisible by any other numbers except for themselves and 1).

Exercise 5: (4) Repeat Exercise 10 from the previous chapter, using the ternary operator
and a bitwise test to display the ones and zeroes, instead of Integer.toBinaryString( ).

### ‚òò The comma operator
Earlier in this chapter I stated that the comma operator (not the comma separator, which is
used to separate definitions and method arguments) has only one use in Java: in the control
expression of a for loop. In both the initialization and step portions of the control
expression, you can have a number of statements separated by commas, and those
statements will be evaluated sequentially.

Using the comma operator, you can define multiple variables within a for statement, but
they must be of the same type:

```java
//: control/CommaOperator.java

public class CommaOperator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1, j = i + 10; i < 5; i++, j = i * 2) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i + " j = " + j);
        }
    }
}/* Output:
i = 1 j = 11
i = 2 j = 4
i = 3 j = 6
i = 4 j = 8
*///:~
```
The int definition in the for statement covers both i and j. The initialization portion can
have any number of definitions of one type. The ability to define variables in a control
expression is limited to the for loop. You cannot use this approach with any of the other
selection or iteration statements.

You can see that in both the initialization and step portions, the statements are evaluated in
sequential order.

## üçÄ06.04 Foreach syntax
Java SE5 introduces a new and more succinct for syntax, for use with arrays and containers
(you'll learn more about these in the Arrays and Containers in Depth chapter). This is often
called the foreach syntax, and it means that you don't have to create an int to count through
a sequence of items‚Äîthe foreach produces each item for you, automatically.

For example, suppose you have an array of float and you'd like to select each element in that
array:

```java
//: control/ForEachFloat.java
import java.util.*;

public class ForEachFloat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        float f[] = new float[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            f[i] = rand.nextFloat();
        for (float x: f)
            System.out.println(x);
    }
}/* Output:
0.72711575
0.39982635
0.5309454
0.0534122
0.16020656
0.57799757
0.18847865
0.4170137
0.51660204
0.73734957
*///:~
```
The array is populated using the old for loop, because it must be accessed with an index. You
can see the foreach syntax in the line:

    for(float x : f) {

This defines a variable x of type float and sequentially assigns each element of f to x.
Any method that returns an array is a candidate for use with foreach. For example, the
String class has a method toCharArray( ) that returns an array of char, so you can easily
iterate through the characters in a string:

```java
//: control/ForEachString.java

public class ForEachString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(char c : "An African Swallow".toCharArray() )
            System.out.print(c + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
A n A f r i c a n S w a l l o w
*///:~
```
As you'll see in the Holding Your Objects chapter, foreach will also work with any object that
is Iterable.

Many for statements involve stepping through a sequence of integral values, like this:

    for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)

For these, the foreach syntax won't work unless you want to create an array of int first. To
simplify this task, I've created a method called range( ) in net.mindview.util.Range that
automatically generates the appropriate array. My intent is for range( ) to be used as a
static import:

```java
//: control/ForEachInt.java
import static net.mindview.util.Range.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ForEachInt {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i: range(10)) // 0..9
            printnb(i + " ");
        print();
        for (int i: range(5, 10)) // 5..9
            printnb(i + " ");
        print();
        for (int i: range(5, 20, 3)) // 5..20 step 3
            printnb(i + " ");
        print();
    }
} /* Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5 6 7 8 9
5 8 11 14 17
*///:~
```
The range( ) method has been overloaded, which means the same method name can be
used with different argument lists (you'll learn about overloading soon). The first overloaded
form of range( ) just starts at zero and produces values up to but not including the top end
of the range. The second form starts at the first value and goes until one less than the second,
and the third form has a step value so it increases by that value. range( ) is a very simple
version of what's called a generator, which you'll see later in the book.

Note that although range( ) allows the use of the foreach syntax in more places, and thus
arguably increases readability, it is a little less efficient, so if you are tuning for performance
you may want to use a profiler, which is a tool that measures the performance of your code.
You'll note the use of printnb( ) in addition to print( ). The printnb( ) method does not
emit a newline, so it allows you to output a line in pieces.

The foreach syntax not only saves time when typing in code. More importantly, it is far easier
to read and says what you are trying to do (get each element of the array) rather than giving
the details of how you are doing it (‚ÄúI'm creating this index so I can use it to select each of the
array elements.‚Äù). The foreach syntax will be used whenever possible in this book.

## üçÄ06.05 return
Several keywords represent unconditional branching, which simply means that the branch
happens without any test. These include return, break, continue, and a way to jump to a
labeled statement which is similar to the goto in other languages.

The return keyword has two purposes: It specifies what value a method will return (if it
doesn't have a void return value) and it causes the current method to exit, returning that
value. The preceding test( ) method can be rewritten to take advantage of this:

```java
//: control/IfElse2.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class IfElse2 {
    static int test(int testval, int target) {
        if (testval > target)
            return +1;
        else if (testval < target)
            return -1;
        else
            return 0; // Match
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(test(10, 5));
        print(test(5, 10));
        print(test(5, 5));
    }
}/* Output:
1
-1
0
*///:~
```
There's no need for else, because the method will not continue after executing a return.
If you do not have a return statement in a method that returns void, there's an implicit
return at the end of that method, so it's not always necessary to include a return statement.
However, if your method states it will return anything other than void, you must ensure
every code path will return a value.

Exercise 6: (2) Modify the two test( ) methods in the previous two programs so that
they take two extra arguments, begin and end, and so that testval is tested to see if it is
within the range between (and including) begin and end.

## üçÄ06.06 break and continue
You can also control the flow of the loop inside the body of any of the iteration statements by
using break and continue. break quits the loop without executing the rest of the
statements in the loop. continue stops the execution of the current iteration and goes back
to the beginning of the loop to begin the next iteration.

This program shows examples of break and continue within for and while loops:

```java
//: control/BreakAndContinue.java
// Demonstrates break and continue keywords.
import static net.mindview.util.Range.*;

public class BreakAndContinue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            if (i == 74) break; // Out of for loop
            if (i % 9 != 0) continue; // Next iteration
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        // Using foreach:
        for (int i: range(100)) {
            if (i == 74) break; // Out of for loop
            if (i % 9 != 0) continue; // Next iteration
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        int i = 0;
        // An "infinite loop":
        while (true) {
            i++;
            int j = i * 27;
            if (j == 1269) break; // Out of loop
            if (i % 10 != 0) continue; // Top of loop
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}/* Output:
0 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72
0 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72
10 20 30 40
*///:~
```
In the for loop, the value of i never gets to 100 because the break statement breaks out of
the loop when i is 74. Normally, you'd use a break like this only if you didn't know when the
terminating condition was going to occur. The continue statement causes execution to go
back to the top of the iteration loop (thus incrementing i) whenever i is not evenly divisible
by 9. When it is, the value is printed.

The second for loop shows the use of foreach, and that it produces the same results.
Finally, you see an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù while loop that would, in theory, continue forever. However,
inside the loop there is a break statement that will break out of the loop. In addition, you'll
see that the continue statement moves control back to the top of the loop without
completing anything after that continue statement. (Thus printing happens in the second
loop only when the value of i is divisible by 10.) In the output, the value 0 is printed, because
0 % 9 produces 0.

A second form of the infinite loop is for(;;). The compiler treats both while(true) and
for(;;) in the same way, so whichever one you use is a matter of programming taste.
Exercise 7: (1) Modify Exercise 1 so that the program exits by using the break keyword
at value 99. Try using return instead.

## üçÄ06.07 The infamous ‚Äúgoto‚Äù
The goto keyword has been present in programming languages from the beginning. Indeed,
goto was the genesis of program control in assembly language: ‚ÄúIf condition A, then jump
here; otherwise, jump there.‚Äù If you read the assembly code that is ultimately generated by
virtually any compiler, you'll see that program control contains many jumps (the Java
compiler produces its own ‚Äúassembly code,‚Äù but this code is run by the Java Virtual Machine
rather than directly on a hardware CPU).

A goto is a jump at the source-code level, and that's what brought it into disrepute. If a
program will always jump from one point to another, isn't there some way to reorganize the
code so the flow of control is not so jumpy? goto fell into true disfavor with the publication
of the famous ‚ÄúGoto considered harmful‚Äù paper by Edsger Dijkstra, and since then goto-
bashing has been a popular sport, with advocates of the cast-out keyword scurrying for cover.
As is typical in situations like this, the middle ground is the most fruitful. The problem is not
the use of goto, but the overuse of goto; in rare situations goto is actually the best way to
structure control flow.

Although goto is a reserved word in Java, it is not used in the language; Java has no goto.
However, it does have something that looks a bit like a jump tied in with the break and
continue keywords. It's not a jump but rather a way to break out of an iteration statement.
The reason it's often thrown in with discussions of goto is because it uses the same
mechanism: a label.

A label is an identifier followed by a colon, like this:

    label1:

The only place a label is useful in Java is right before an iteration statement. And that means
right before‚Äîit does no good to put any other statement between the label and the iteration.
And the sole reason to put a label before an iteration is if you're going to nest another
iteration or a switch (which you'll learn about shortly) inside it. That's because the break
and continue keywords will normally interrupt only the current loop, but when used with a
label, they'll interrupt the loops up to where the label exists:
```java
label1:
outer-iteration {
    inner-iteration {
        //...
        break; // (1)
        //...
        continue; // (2)
        //...
        continue label1; // (3)
        //...
        break label1; // (4)
    }
}
```

In (1), the break breaks out of the inner iteration and you end up in the outer iteration. In
(2), the continue moves back to the beginning of the inner iteration. But in (3), the
continue label1 breaks out of the inner iteration and the outer iteration, all the way back to
label1. Then it does in fact continue the iteration, but starting at the outer iteration. In (4),
the break label1 also breaks all the way out to label1, but it does not reenter the iteration.
It actually does break out of both iterations.

Here is an example using for loops:

```java
//: control/LabeledFor.java
// For loops with "labeled break" and "labeled continue."
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class LabeledFor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
outer: // Can't have statements here
        for (; true;) { // infinite loop
inner: // Can't have statements here
            for (; i < 10; i++) {
                print("i = " + i);
                if (i == 2) {
                    print("continue");
                    continue;
                }
                if (i == 3) {
                    print("break");
                    i++; // Otherwise i never
                    // gets incremented.
                    break;
                }
                if (i == 7) {
                    print("continue outer");
                    i++; // Otherwise i never
                    // gets incremented.
                    continue outer;
                }
                if (i == 8) {
                    print("break outer");
                    break outer;
                }
                for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
                    if (k == 3) {
                        print("continue inner");
                        continue inner;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    // Can't break or continue to labels here
    }
}/* Output:
i = 0
continue inner

break
i = 4
continue inner
i = 5

continue inner
i = 7
continue outer
i = 8
break outer
*///:~
```
Note that break breaks out of the for loop, and that the increment expression doesn't occur
until the end of the pass through the for loop. Since break skips the increment expression,
the increment is performed directly in the case of i == 3. The continue outer statement in
the case of i == 7 also goes to the top of the loop and also skips the increment, so it too is
incremented directly.

If not for the break outer statement, there would be no way to get out of the outer loop
from within an inner loop, since break by itself can break out of only the innermost loop.
(The same is true for continue.)

Of course, in the cases where breaking out of a loop will also exit the method, you can simply
use a return.

Here is a demonstration of labeled break and continue statements with while loops:

```java
//: control/LabeledWhile.java
// While loops with "labeled break" and "labeled continue."
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class LabeledWhile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        outer:
            while (true) {
                print("Outer while loop");
                while (true) {
                    i++;
                    print("i = " + i);
                    if (i == 1) {
                        print("continue");
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (i == 3) {
                        print("continue outer");
                        continue outer;
                    }
                    if (i == 5) {
                        print("break");
                        break;
                    }
                    if (i == 7) {
                        print("break outer");
                        break outer;
                    }
                }
            }
    }
}/* Output:
Outer while loop

```
The same rules hold true for while:
1. A plain continue goes to the top of the innermost loop and continues.
2. A labeled continue goes to the label and reenters the loop right after that label.
3. A break ‚Äúdrops out of the bottom‚Äù of the loop.
4. A labeled break drops out of the bottom of the end of the loop denoted by the label.

It's important to remember that the only reason to use labels in Java is when you have nested
loops and you want to break or continue through more than one nested level.

In Dijkstra's ‚ÄúGoto considered harmful‚Äù paper, what he specifically objected to was the labels,
not the goto. He observed that the number of bugs seems to increase with the number of
labels in a program, and that labels and gotos make programs difficult to analyze. Note that
Java labels don't suffer from this problem, since they are constrained in their placement and
can't be used to transfer control in an ad hoc manner. It's also interesting to note that this is a
case where a language feature is made more useful by restricting the power of the statement.

## üçÄ06.08 switch
The switch is sometimes called a selection statement. The switch statement selects from
among pieces of code based on the value of an integral expression. Its general form is:

    switch(integral-selector) {
    case integral-value1 : statement; break;
    case integral-value2 : statement; break;
    case integral-value3 : statement; break;
    case integral-value4 : statement; break;
    case integral-value5 : statement; break;
    // ...
    default: statement;
    }

Integral-selector is an expression that produces an integral value. The switch compares the
result of integral-selector to each integral-value. If it finds a match, the corresponding
statement (a single statement or multiple statements; braces are not required) executes. If no
match occurs, the default statement executes.

You will notice in the preceding definition that each case ends with a break, which causes
execution to jump to the end of the switch body. This is the conventional way to build a
switch statement, but the break is optional. If it is missing, the code for the following case
statements executes until a break is encountered. Although you don't usually want this kind
of behavior, it can be useful to an experienced programmer. Note that the last statement,
following the default, doesn't have a break because the execution just falls through to
where the break would have taken it anyway. You could put a break at the end of the
default statement with no harm if you considered it important for style's sake.

The switch statement is a clean way to implement multiway selection (i.e., selecting from
among a number of different execution paths), but it requires a selector that evaluates to an
integral value, such as int or char. If you want to use, for example, a string or a floating
point number as a selector, it won't work in a switch statement. For non-integral types, you
must use a series of if statements. At the end of the next chapter, you'll see that Java SE5's
new enum feature helps ease this restriction, as enums are designed to work nicely with
switch.

Here's an example that creates letters randomly and determines whether they're vowels or
consonants:

```java
//: control/VowelsAndConsonants.java
// Demonstrates the switch statement.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class VowelsAndConsonants {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            int c = rand.nextInt(26) + 'a';
            printnb((char) c + ", " + c + ": ");
            switch (c) {
                case 'a':
                case 'e':
                case 'i':
                case 'o':
                case 'u': print("vowel");
                break;
                case 'y':
                case 'w': print("Sometimes a vowel");
                break;
                default:
                    print("consonant");
            }
        }
    }
}/* Output:
y, 121: Sometimes a vowel
n, 110: consonant
z, 122: consonant
b, 98: consonant
r, 114: consonant
n, 110: consonant
y, 121: Sometimes a vowel
g, 103: consonant
c, 99: consonant
f, 102: consonant
o, 111: vowel
w, 119: Sometimes a vowel
z, 122: consonant

```
Since Random.nextInt(26) generates a value between 0 and 26, you need only add an
offset of 'a' to produce the lowercase letters. The single-quoted characters in the case
statements also produce integral values that are used for comparison.

Notice how the cases can be ‚Äústacked‚Äù on top of each other to provide multiple matches for a
particular piece of code. You should also be aware that it's essential to put the break
statement at the end of a particular case; otherwise, control will simply drop through and
continue processing on the next case.

In the statement:

    int c = rand.nextInt(26) + 'a';

Random.nextInt( ) produces a random int value from 0 to 25, which is added to the value
of 'a'. This means that 'a' is automatically converted to an int to perform the addition.
In order to print c as a character, it must be cast to char; otherwise, you'll produce integral
output.

Exercise 8: (2) Create a switch statement that prints a message for each case, and put
the switch inside a for loop that tries each case. Put a break after each case and test it,
then remove the breaks and see what happens.

Exercise 9: (4) A Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
34, and so on, where each number (from the third on) is the sum of the previous two. Create
a method that takes an integer as an argument and displays that many Fibonacci numbers
starting from the beginning, e.g., If you run java Fibonacci 5 (where Fibonacci is the
name of the class) the output will be: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

Exercise 10: (5) A vampire number has an even number of digits and is formed by
multiplying a pair of numbers containing half the number of digits of the result. The digits
are taken from the original number in any order. Pairs of trailing zeroes are not allowed.
Examples include:

    1260 = 21 * 60
    1827 = 21 * 87
    2187 = 27 * 81

Write a program that finds all the 4-digit vampire numbers. (Suggested by Dan Forhan.)

## üçÄ06.09 Summary
This chapter concludes the study of fundamental features that appear in most programming
languages: calculation, operator precedence, type casting, and selection and iteration. Now
you're ready to begin taking steps that move you closer to the world of object-oriented
programming. The next chapter will cover the important issues of initialization and cleanup
of objects, followed in the subsequent chapter by the essential concept of implementation
hiding.

Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java Annotated 
Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net.

# üìú 07. Initialization & Cleanup
As the computer revolution progresses, ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù programming has
become one of the major culprits that makes programming expensive.

Two of these safety issues are initialization and cleanup. Many C bugs occur when the
programmer forgets to initialize a variable. This is especially true with libraries when users
don't know how to initialize a library component, or even that they must. Cleanup is a special
problem because it's easy to forget about an element when you're done with it, since it no
longer concerns you. Thus, the resources used by that element are retained and you can
easily end up running out of resources (most notably, memory).

C++ introduced the concept of a constructor, a special method automatically called when an
object is created. Java also adopted the constructor, and in addition has a garbage collector
that automatically releases memory resources when they're no longer being used. This
chapter examines the issues of initialization and cleanup, and their support in Java.

## üçÄ07.01 Guaranteed initialization with the constructor
You can imagine creating a method called initialize( ) for every class you write. The name is
a hint that it should be called before using the object. Unfortunately, this means the user
must remember to call that method. In Java, the class designer can guarantee initialization of
every object by providing a constructor. If a class has a constructor, Java automatically calls
that constructor when an object is created, before users can even get their hands on it. So
initialization is guaranteed.

The next challenge is what to name this method. There are two issues. The first is that any
name you use could clash with a name you might like to use as a member in the class. The
second is that because the compiler is responsible for calling the constructor, it must always
know which method to call. The C++ solution seems the easiest and most logical, so it's also
used in Java: The name of the constructor is the same as the name of the class. It makes
sense that such a method will be called automatically during initialization.
Here's a simple class with a constructor:

```java
//: initialization/SimpleConstructor.java
// Demonstration of a simple constructor.

class Rock {
    Rock() { // This is the constructor
        System.out.print("Rock ");
    }
}

public class SimpleConstructor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            new Rock();
    }
} /* Output:
Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock Rock
*///:~
```
Now, when an object is created:

    new Rock();

storage is allocated and the constructor is called. It is guaranteed that the object will be
properly initialized before you can get your hands on it.

Note that the coding style of making the first letter of all methods lowercase does not apply to
constructors, since the name of the constructor must match the name of the class exactly.
A constructor that takes no arguments is called the default constructor. The Java documents
typically use the term no-arg constructor, but ‚Äúdefault constructor‚Äù has been in use for many
years before Java appeared, so I will tend to use that. But like any method, the constructor
can also have arguments to allow you to specify how an object is created. The preceding
example can easily be changed so the constructor takes an argument:

```java
//: initialization/SimpleConstructor2.java
// Constructors can have arguments.

class Rock2 {
    Rock2(int i) {
        System.out.print("Rock " + i + " ");
    }
}

public class SimpleConstructor2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
            new Rock2(i);
    }
}/* Output:
Rock 0 Rock 1 Rock 2 Rock 3 Rock 4 Rock 5 Rock 6 Rock 7
*///:~
```
Constructor arguments provide you with a way to provide parameters for the initialization of
an object. For example, if the class Tree has a constructor that takes a single integer
argument denoting the height of the tree, you create a Tree object like this:

    Tree t = new Tree(12); // 12-foot tree

If Tree(int) is your only constructor, then the compiler won't let you create a Tree object
any other way.

Constructors eliminate a large class of problems and make the code easier to read. In the
preceding code fragment, for example, you don't see an explicit call to some initialize( )
method that is conceptually separate from creation. In Java, creation and initialization are
unified concepts‚Äîyou can't have one without the other.

The constructor is an unusual type of method because it has no return value. This is distinctly
different from a void return value, in which the method returns nothing but you still have
the option to make it return something else. Constructors return nothing and you don't have
an option (the new expression does return a reference to the newly created object, but the
constructor itself has no return value). If there were a return value, and if you could select
your own, the compiler would somehow need to know what to do with that return value.

Exercise 1: (1) Create a class containing an uninitialized String reference. Demonstrate
that this reference is initialized by Java to null.

Exercise 2: (2) Create a class with a String field that is initialized at the point of
definition, and another one that is initialized by the constructor. What is the difference
between the two approaches?

## üçÄ07.02 Method overloading
One of the important features in any programming language is the use of names. When you
create an object, you give a name to a region of storage. A method is a name for an action.
You refer to all objects and methods by using names. Well-chosen names create a system that
is easier for people to understand and change. It's a lot like writing prose‚Äîthe goal is to
communicate with your readers.

A problem arises when mapping the concept of nuance in human language onto a
programming language. Often, the same word expresses a number of different meanings‚Äîit's
overloaded. This is useful, especially when it comes to trivial differences. You say, ‚ÄúWash the
shirt,‚Äù ‚ÄúWash the car,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWash the dog.‚Äù It would be silly to be forced to say, ‚ÄúshirtWash
the shirt,‚Äù ‚ÄúcarWash the car,‚Äù and ‚ÄúdogWash the dog‚Äù just so the listener doesn't need to
make any distinction about the action performed. Most human languages are redundant, so
even if you miss a few words, you can still determine the meaning. You don't need unique
identifiers‚Äîyou can deduce meaning from context.

Most programming languages (C in particular) require you to have a unique identifier for
each method (often called functions in those languages). So you could not have one function
called print( ) for printing integers and another called print( ) for printing floats‚Äîeach
function requires a unique name.

In Java (and C++), another factor forces the overloading of method names: the constructor.
Because the constructor's name is predetermined by the name of the class, there can be only
one constructor name. But what if you want to create an object in more than one way? For
example, suppose you build a class that can initialize itself in a standard way or by reading
information from a file. You need two constructors, the default constructor and one that
takes a String as an argument, which is the name of the file from which to initialize the
object. Both are constructors, so they must have the same name‚Äîthe name of the class. Thus,
method overloading is essential to allow the same method name to be used with different
argument types. And although method overloading is a must for constructors, it's a general
convenience and can be used with any method.

Here's an example that shows both overloaded constructors and overloaded methods:

```java
//: initialization/Overloading.java
// Demonstration of both constructor
// and ordinary method overloading.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Tree {
    int height;
    Tree() {
        print("Planting a seedling");
        height = 0;
    }
    Tree(int initialHeight) {
        height = initialHeight;
        print("Creating new Tree that is " +
            height + " feet tall");
    }
    void info() {
        print("Tree is " + height + " feet tall");
    }
    void info(String s) {
        print(s + ": Tree is " + height + " feet tall");
    }
}

public class Overloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            Tree t = new Tree(i);
            t.info();
            t.info("overloaded method");
        }
        // Overloaded constructor:
        new Tree();
    }
} /* Output:
Creating new Tree that is 0 feet tall
Tree is 0 feet tall
overloaded method: Tree is 0 feet tall
Creating new Tree that is 1 feet tall
Tree is 1 feet tall
overloaded method: Tree is 1 feet tall
Creating new Tree that is 2 feet tall
Tree is 2 feet tall
overloaded method: Tree is 2 feet tall
Creating new Tree that is 3 feet tall
Tree is 3 feet tall
overloaded method: Tree is 3 feet tall
Creating new Tree that is 4 feet tall
Tree is 4 feet tall
overloaded method: Tree is 4 feet tall
Planting a seedling
*///:~
```
A Tree object can be created either as a seedling, with no argument, or as a plant grown in a
nursery, with an existing height. To support this, there is a default constructor, and one that
takes the existing height.

You might also want to call the info( ) method in more than one way. For example, if you
have an extra message you want printed, you can use info(String), and info( ) if you have
nothing more to say. It would seem strange to give two separate names to what is obviously
the same concept. Fortunately, method overloading allows you to use the same name for
both.

### ‚òò Distinguishing overloaded methods
If the methods have the same name, how can Java know which method you mean? There's a
simple rule: Each overloaded method must take a unique list of argument types.

If you think about this for a second, it makes sense. How else could a programmer tell the
difference between two methods that have the same name, other than by the types of their
arguments?

Even differences in the ordering of arguments are sufficient to distinguish two methods,
although you don't normally want to take this approach because it produces difficult-to-
maintain code:

```java
//: initialization/OverloadingOrder.java
// Overloading based on the order of the arguments.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class OverloadingOrder {
    static void f(String s, int i) {
        print("String: " + s + ", int: " + i);
    }
    static void f(int i, String s) {
        print("int: " + i + ", String: " + s);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f("String first", 11);
        f(99, "Int first");
    }
}/* Output:
String: String first, int: 11
int: 99, String: Int first
*///:~
```
The two f( ) methods have identical arguments, but the order is different, and that's what
makes them distinct.

### ‚òò Overloading with primitives
A primitive can be automatically promoted from a smaller type to a larger one, and this can
be slightly confusing in combination with overloading. The following example demonstrates
what happens when a primitive is handed to an overloaded method:

```java
//: initialization/PrimitiveOverloading.java
// Promotion of primitives and overloading.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PrimitiveOverloading {
    void f1(char x) { printnb("f1(char)   "); }
    void f1(byte x) { printnb("f1(byte)   "); }
    void f1(short x) { printnb("f1(short)  "); }
    void f1(int x) { printnb("f1(int)    "); }
    void f1(long x) { printnb("f1(long)   "); }

    void f2(int x) { printnb("f2(int)    "); }
    void f2(long x) { printnb("f2(long)   "); }
    void f2(float x) { printnb("f2(float)  "); }
    void f2(double x) { printnb("f2(double) "); }

    void f3(short x) { printnb("f3(short)  "); }
    void f3(int x) { printnb("f3(int)    "); }
    void f3(long x) { printnb("f3(long)   "); }
    void f3(float x) { printnb("f3(float)  "); }
    void f3(double x) { printnb("f3(double) "); }

    void f4(int x) { printnb("f4(int)    "); }
    void f4(long x) { printnb("f4(long)   "); }
    void f4(float x) { printnb("f4(float)  "); }
    void f4(double x) { printnb("f4(double) "); }

    void f5(long x) { printnb("f5(long)   "); }
    void f5(float x) { printnb("f5(float)  "); }
    void f5(double x) { printnb("f5(double) "); }

    void f6(float x) { printnb("f6(float)  "); }
    void f6(double x) { printnb("f6(double) "); }

    void f7(double x) { printnb("f7(double) "); }

    void testConstVal() {
        printnb("5: ");
        f1(5); f2(5); f3(5); f4(5); f5(5); f6(5); f7(5); print();
    }
    void testChar() {
        char x = 'x';
        printnb("char: ");
        f1(x); f2(x); f3(x); f4(x); f5(x); f6(x); f7(x); print();
    }
    void testByte() {
        byte x = 0;
        printnb("byte: ");
        f1(x); f2(x); f3(x); f4(x); f5(x); f6(x); f7(x); print();

    void testInt() {

        printnb("double: ");
        f1(x); f2(x); f3(x); f4(x); f5(x); f6(x); f7(x); print();

```
You can see that the constant value 5 is treated as an int, so if an overloaded method is
available that takes an int, it is used. In all other cases, if you have a data type that is smaller
than the argument in the method, that data type is promoted. char produces a slightly
different effect, since if it doesn't find an exact char match, it is promoted to int.

What happens if your argument is bigger than the argument expected by the overloaded
method? A modification of the preceding program gives the answer:

```java
//: initialization/Demotion.java
// Demotion of primitives and overloading.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Demotion {
    void f1(char x) { print("f1(char)"); }

    void f3(byte x) { print("f3(byte)"); }
    void f3(short x) { print("f3(short)"); }
    void f3(int x) { print("f3(int)"); }

    void f6(char x) { print("f6(char)"); }
    void f6(byte x) { print("f6(byte)"); }

    void f7(char x) { print("f7(char)"); }

    void testDouble() {
        double x = 0;
        print("double argument:");
        f1(x);
        f2((float) x);
        f3((long) x);
        f4((int) x);
        f5((short) x);
        f6((byte) x);
        f7((char) x);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demotion p = new Demotion();
        p.testDouble();
    }
}/* Output:

*///:~
```

Here, the methods take narrower primitive values. If your argument is wider, then you must
perform a narrowing conversion with a cast. If you don't do this, the compiler will issue an
error message.

### ‚òò Overloading on return values
It is common to wonder, ‚ÄúWhy only class names and method argument lists? Why not
distinguish between methods based on their return values?‚Äù For example, these two
methods, which have the same name and arguments, are easily distinguished from each
other:

    void f() {}
    int f() { return 1; }

This might work fine as long as the compiler could unequivocally determine the meaning
from the context, as in int x = f( ). However, you can also call a method and ignore the
return value. This is often referred to as calling a method for its side effect, since you don't
care about the return value, but instead want the other effects of the method call. So if you
call the method this way:

    f();

how can Java determine which f( ) should be called? And how could someone reading the
code see it? Because of this sort of problem, you cannot use return value types to distinguish
overloaded methods.

## üçÄ07.03 Default constructors
As mentioned previously, a default constructor (a.k.a. a ‚Äúno-arg‚Äù constructor) is one without
arguments that is used to create a ‚Äúdefault object.‚Äù If you create a class that has no
constructors, the compiler will automatically create a default constructor for you. For
example:

```java
//: initialization/DefaultConstructor.java

class Bird {}

public class DefaultConstructor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird b = new Bird(); // Default!
    }
} ///:~
```
The expression

    new Bird()

creates a new object and calls the default constructor, even though one was not explicitly
defined. Without it, you would have no method to call to build the object. However, if you
define any constructors (with or without arguments), the compiler will not synthesize one for
you:

```java
//: initialization/NoSynthesis.java

class Bird2 {
    Bird2(int i) {}
    Bird2(double d) {}
}

public class NoSynthesis {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //! Bird2 b = new Bird2(); // No default
        Bird2 b2 = new Bird2(1);
        Bird2 b3 = new Bird2(1.0);
    }
} ///:~
```
If you say:

    new Bird2()

the compiler will complain that it cannot find a constructor that matches. When you don't
put in any constructors, it's as if the compiler says, ‚ÄúYou are bound to need some constructor,
so let me make one for you.‚Äù But if you write a constructor, the compiler says, ‚ÄúYou've written
a constructor so you know what you're doing; if you didn't put in a default it's because you
meant to leave it out.‚Äù

Exercise 3: (1) Create a class with a default constructor (one that takes no arguments)
that prints a message. Create an object of this class.

Exercise 4: (1) Add an overloaded constructor to the previous exercise that takes a
String argument and prints it along with your message.

Exercise 5: (2) Create a class called Dog with an overloaded bark( ) method. This
method should be overloaded based on various primitive data types, and print different types
of barking, howling, etc., depending on which overloaded version is called. Write a main( )
that calls all the different versions.

Exercise 6: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that two of the overloaded methods have
two arguments (of two different types), but in reversed order relative to each other. Verify
that this works.

Exercise 7: (1) Create a class without a constructor, and then create an object of that
class in main( ) to verify that the default constructor is automatically synthesized.

## üçÄ07.04 The this keyword
If you have two objects of the same type called a and b, you might wonder how it is that you
can call a method peel( ) for both those objects:

```java
//: initialization/BananaPeel.java

class Banana { void peel(int i) { /* ... */ } }

public class BananaPeel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Banana a = new Banana(),
        b = new Banana();
        a.peel(1);
        b.peel(2);
    }
} ///:~
```
If there's only one method called peel( ), how can that method know whether it's being
called for the object a or b?

To allow you to write the code in a convenient object-oriented syntax in which you ‚Äúsend a
message to an object,‚Äù the compiler does some undercover work for you. There's a secret first
argument passed to the method peel( ), and that argument is the reference to the object
that's being manipulated. So the two method calls become something like:

    Banana.peel(a, 1);
    Banana.peel(b, 2);

This is internal and you can't write these expressions and get the compiler to accept them,
but it gives you an idea of what's happening.

Suppose you're inside a method and you'd like to get the reference to the current object.
Since that reference is passed secretly by the compiler, there's no identifier for it. However,
for this purpose there's a keyword: this. The this keyword‚Äîwhich can be used only inside a
non-static method‚Äîproduces the reference to the object that the method has been called
for. You can treat the reference just like any other object reference. Keep in mind that if
you're calling a method of your class from within another method of your class, you don't
need to use this. You simply call the method. The current this reference is automatically
used for the other method. Thus you can say:

```java
//: initialization/Apricot.java
public class Apricot {
    void pick() { /* ... */ }
    void pit() { pick(); /* ... */ }
} ///:~
```
Inside pit( ), you could say this.pick( ) but there's no need to. 1 The compiler does it for you
automatically. The this keyword is used only for those special cases in which you need to
explicitly use the reference to the current object. For example, it's often used in return
statements when you want to return the reference to the current object:

1 Some people will obsessively put this in front of every method call and field reference, 
arguing that it makes it ‚Äúclearer and more explicit.‚Äù Don't do it. There's a reason 
that we use high-level languages: They do things for us. If you put this in
when it's not necessary, you will confuse and annoy everyone who reads your code, 
since all the rest of the code they've read won't use this everywhere. People expect 
this to be used only when it is necessary. Following a consistent and
straightforward coding style saves time and money.

```java
//: initialization/Leaf.java
// Simple use of the "this" keyword.

public class Leaf {
    int i = 0;
    Leaf increment() {
        i++;
        return this;
    }
    void print() {
        System.out.println("i = " + i);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Leaf x = new Leaf();
        x.increment().increment().increment().print();
    }
} /* Output:
i = 3
*///:~
```
Because increment( ) returns the reference to the current object via the this keyword,
multiple operations can easily be performed on the same object.
The this keyword is also useful for passing the current object to another method:

```java
//: initialization/PassingThis.java

class Person {
    public void eat(Apple apple) {
        Apple peeled = apple.getPeeled();
        System.out.println("Yummy");
    }
}

class Peeler {
    static Apple peel(Apple apple) {
        // ... remove peel
        return apple; // Peeled
    }
}

class Apple {
    Apple getPeeled() { return Peeler.peel(this); }
}

public class PassingThis {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Person().eat(new Apple());
    }
} /* Output:
Yummy
*///:~
```
Apple needs to call Peeler.peel( ), which is a foreign utility method that performs an
operation that, for some reason, needs to be external to Apple (perhaps the external method
can be applied across many different classes, and you don't want to repeat the code). To pass
itself to the foreign method, it must use this.

Exercise 8: (1) Create a class with two methods. Within the first method, call the second
method twice: the first time without using this, and the second time using this‚Äîjust to see it
working; you should not use this form in practice.

### ‚òò Calling constructors from constructors
When you write several constructors for a class, there are times when you'd like to call one
constructor from another to avoid duplicating code. You can make such a call by using the
this keyword.

Normally, when you say this, it is in the sense of ‚Äúthis object‚Äù or ‚Äúthe current object,‚Äù and by
itself it produces the reference to the current object. In a constructor, the this keyword takes
on a different meaning when you give it an argument list. It makes an explicit call to the
constructor that matches that argument list. Thus you have a straightforward way to call
other constructors:

```java
//: initialization/Flower.java
// Calling constructors with "this"
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Flower {
    int petalCount = 0;
    String s = "initial value";
    Flower(int petals) {
        petalCount = petals;
        print("Constructor w/ int arg only, petalCount= " + petalCount);
    }
    Flower(String ss) {
        print("Constructor w/ String arg only, s = " + ss);
        s = ss;
    }
    Flower(String s, int petals) {
        this(petals);
        //! this(s); // Can't call two!
        this.s = s; // Another use of "this"
        print("String & int args");
    }
    Flower() {
        this("hi", 47);
        print("default constructor (no args)");
    }
    void printPetalCount() {
        //! this(11); // Not inside non-constructor!
        print("petalCount = " + petalCount + " s = " + s);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flower x = new Flower();
        x.printPetalCount();
    }
} /* Output:
Constructor w/ int arg only, petalCount= 47
String & int args
default constructor (no args)
petalCount = 47 s = hi
*///:~
```
The constructor Flower(String s, int petals) shows that, while you can call one
constructor using this, you cannot call two. In addition, the constructor call must be the first
thing you do, or you'll get a compiler error message.

This example also shows another way you'll see this used. Since the name of the argument s
and the name of the member data s are the same, there's an ambiguity. You can resolve it
using this.s, to say that you're referring to the member data. You'll often see this form used
in Java code, and it's used in numerous places in this book.

In printPetalCount( ) you can see that the compiler won't let you call a constructor from
inside any method other than a constructor.

Exercise 9: (1) Create a class with two (overloaded) constructors. Using this, call the
second constructor inside the first one.

### ‚òò The meaning of static
With the this keyword in mind, you can more fully understand what it means to make a
method static. It means that there is no this for that particular method. You cannot call
non-static methods from inside static methods 2 (although the reverse is possible), and you
can call a static method for the class itself, without any object. In fact, that's primarily what
a static method is for. It's as if you're creating the equivalent of a global method. However,
global methods are not permitted in Java, and putting the static method inside a class allows
it access to other static methods and to static fields.

Some people argue that static methods are not object-oriented, since they do have the
semantics of a global method; with a static method, you don't send a message to an object,
since there's no this. This is probably a fair argument, and if you find yourself using a lot of
static methods, you should probably rethink your strategy. However, statics are pragmatic,
and there are times when you genuinely need them, so whether or not they are ‚Äúproper OOP‚Äù
should be left to the theoreticians.

## üçÄ07.05 Cleanup: finalization and garbage collection
Programmers know about the importance of initialization, but often forget the importance of
cleanup. After all, who needs to clean up an int? But with libraries, simply ‚Äúletting go‚Äù of an
object once you're done with it is not always safe. Of course, Java has the garbage collector to
reclaim the memory of objects that are no longer used. Now consider an unusual case:
Suppose your object allocates ‚Äúspecial‚Äù memory without using new. The garbage collector
only knows how to release memory allocated with new, so it won't know how to release the
object's ‚Äúspecial‚Äù memory. To handle this case, Java provides a method called `finalize( )`
that you can define for your class. Here's how it's supposed to work. When the garbage
collector is ready to release the storage used for your object, it will first call finalize( ), and
only on the next garbage-collection pass will it reclaim the object's memory. So if you choose
to use finalize( ), it gives you the ability to perform some important cleanup at the time of
garbage collection.

This is a potential programming pitfall because some programmers, especially C++
programmers, might initially mistake finalize( ) for the destructor in C++, which is a
function that is always called when an object is destroyed. It is important to distinguish
between C++ and Java here, because in C++, objects always get destroyed (in a bug-free
program), whereas in Java, objects do not always get garbage collected. Or, put another way:

    1. Your objects might not get garbage collected.
    2. Garbage collection is not destruction.

2 The one case in which this is possible occurs if you pass a reference to an object into 
the static method (the static method could also create its own object). Then, via the reference 
(which is now effectively this), you can call non-static methods and access non-static fields. 
But typically, if you want to do something like this, you'll just make an ordinary, non-static method.

If you remember this, you will stay out of trouble. What it means is that if there is some
activity that must be performed before you no longer need an object, you must perform that
activity yourself. Java has no destructor or similar concept, so you must create an ordinary
method to perform this cleanup. For example, suppose that in the process of creating your
object, it draws itself on the screen. If you don't explicitly erase its image from the screen, it
might never get cleaned up. If you put some kind of erasing functionality inside finalize( ),
then if an object is garbage collected and finalize( ) is called (and there's no guarantee this
will happen), then the image will first be removed from the screen, but if it isn't, the image
will remain.

You might find that the storage for an object never gets released because your program never
nears the point of running out of storage. If your program completes and the garbage
collector never gets around to releasing the storage for any of your objects, that storage will
be returned to the operating system en masse as the program exits. This is a good thing,
because garbage collection has some overhead, and if you never do it, you never incur that
expense.

### ‚òò What is finalize() for?
So, if you should not use finalize( ) as a general-purpose cleanup method, what good is it?
A third point to remember is:

    3. Garbage collection is only about memory.

That is, the sole reason for the existence of the garbage collector is to recover memory that
your program is no longer using. So any activity that is associated with garbage collection,
most notably your finalize( ) method, must also be only about memory and its deallocation.

Does this mean that if your object contains other objects, finalize( ) should explicitly release
those objects? Well, no‚Äîthe garbage collector takes care of the release of all object memory
regardless of how the object is created. It turns out that the need for finalize( ) is limited to
special cases in which your object can allocate storage in some way other than creating an
object. But, you might observe, everything in Java is an object, so how can this be?

It would seem that finalize( ) is in place because of the possibility that you'll do something
Clike by allocating memory using a mechanism other than the normal one in Java. This can
happen primarily through native methods, which are a way to call non-Java code from Java.
(Native methods are covered in Appendix B in the electronic 2 nd edition of this book,
available at www.MindView.net.) C and C++ are the only languages currently supported by
native methods, but since they can call subprograms in other languages, you can effectively
call anything. Inside the non-Java code, C's malloc( ) family of functions might be called to
allocate storage, and unless you call free( ), that storage will not be released, causing a
memory leak. Of course, free( ) is a C and C++ function, so you'd need to call it in a native
method inside your finalize( ).

After reading this, you probably get the idea that you won't use finalize( ) much. ¬≥ You're
correct; it is not the appropriate place for normal cleanup to occur. So where should normal
cleanup be performed?

¬≥ Joshua Bloch goes further in his section titled ‚Äúavoid finalizers‚Äù: ‚ÄúFinalizers are 
unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary.‚Äù Effective JavaTM Programming 
Language Guide, p. 20 (Addison-Wesley, 2001).

### ‚òò You must perform cleanup
To clean up an object, the user of that object must call a cleanup method at the point the
cleanup is desired. This sounds pretty straightforward, but it collides a bit with the C++
concept of the destructor. In C++, all objects are destroyed. Or rather, all objects should be
destroyed. If the C++ object is created as a local (i.e., on the stack‚Äînot possible in Java),
then the destruction happens at the closing curly brace of the scope in which the object was
created. If the object was created using new (like in Java), the destructor is called when the
programmer calls the C++ operator delete (which doesn't exist in Java). If the C++
programmer forgets to call delete, the destructor is never called, and you have a memory
leak, plus the other parts of the object never get cleaned up. This kind of bug can be very
difficult to track down, and is one of the compelling reasons to move from C++ to Java.

In contrast, Java doesn't allow you to create local objects‚Äîyou must always use new. But in
Java, there's no ‚Äúdelete‚Äù for releasing the object, because the garbage collector releases the
storage for you. So from a simplistic standpoint, you could say that because of garbage
collection, Java has no destructor. You'll see as this book progresses, however, that the
presence of a garbage collector does not remove the need for or the utility of destructors.
(And you should never call finalize( ) directly, so that's not a solution.) If you want some
kind of cleanup performed other than storage release, you must still explicitly call an
appropriate method in Java, which is the equivalent of a C++ destructor without the
convenience.

Remember that neither garbage collection nor finalization is guaranteed. If the JVM isn't
close to running out of memory, then it might not waste time recovering memory through
garbage collection.

### ‚òò The termination condition
In general, you can't rely on finalize( ) being called, and you must create separate ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù
methods and call them explicitly. So it appears that finalize( ) is only useful for obscure
memory cleanup that most programmers will never use. However, there is an interesting use
of finalize( ) that does not rely on it being called every time. This is the verification of the
termination condition 4 of an object.

At the point that you're no longer interested in an object‚Äîwhen it's ready to be cleaned up‚Äî
that object should be in a state whereby its memory can be safely released. For example, if
the object represents an open file, that file should be closed by the programmer before the
object is garbage collected. If any portions of the object are not properly cleaned up, then you
have a bug in your program that can be very difficult to find. finalize( ) can be used to
eventually discover this condition, even if it isn't always called. If one of the finalizations
happens to reveal the bug, then you discover the problem, which is all you really care about.
Here's a simple example of how you might use it:

4 A term coined by Bill Venners (www.Artima.com) during a seminar that he and I were giving together.

```java
//: initialization/TerminationCondition.java
// Using finalize() to detect an object that
// hasn't been properly cleaned up.

class Book {
    boolean checkedOut = false;
    Book(boolean checkOut) {
        checkedOut = checkOut;
    }

    void checkIn() {
        checkedOut = false;
    }
    protected void finalize() {
        if (checkedOut)
            System.out.println("Error: checked out");
        // Normally, you'll also do this:
        // super.finalize(); // Call the base-class version
    }
}

public class TerminationCondition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book novel = new Book(true);
        // Proper cleanup:
        novel.checkIn();
        // Drop the reference, forget to clean up:
        new Book(true);
        // Force garbage collection & finalization:
        System.gc();
    }
}/* Output:
Error: checked out
*///:~
```
The termination condition is that all Book objects are supposed to be checked in before they
are garbage collected, but in main( ), a programmer error doesn't check in one of the books.
Without finalize( ) to verify the termination condition, this can be a difficult bug to find.
Note that System.gc( ) is used to force finalization. But even if it isn't, it's highly probable
that the errant Book will eventually be discovered through repeated executions of the
program (assuming the program allocates enough storage to cause the garbage collector to
execute).

You should generally assume that the base-class version of finalize( ) will also be doing
something important, and call it using super, as you can see in Book.finalize( ). In this
case, it is commented out because it requires exception handling, which we haven't covered
yet.

Exercise 10: (2) Create a class with a finalize( ) method that prints a message. In

main( ), create an object of your class. Explain the behavior of your program.
Exercise 11: (4) Modify the previous exercise so that your finalize( ) will always be
called.

Exercise 12: (4) Create a class called Tank that can be filled and emptied, and has a
termination condition that it must be empty when the object is cleaned up. Write a
finalize( ) that verifies this termination condition. In main( ), test the possible scenarios
that can occur when your Tank is used.

### ‚òò How a garbage collector works
If you come from a programming language where allocating objects on the heap is expensive,
you may naturally assume that Java's scheme of allocating everything (except primitives) on
the heap is also expensive. However, it turns out that the garbage collector can have a
significant impact on increasing the speed of object creation. This might sound a bit odd at
first‚Äîthat storage release affects storage allocation‚Äîbut it's the way some JVMs work, and it
means that allocating storage for heap objects in Java can be nearly as fast as creating storage
on the stack in other languages.

For example, you can think of the C++ heap as a yard where each object stakes out its own
piece of turf. This real estate can become abandoned sometime later and must be reused. In
some JVMs, the Java heap is quite different; it's more like a conveyor belt that moves
forward every time you allocate a new object. This means that object storage allocation is
remarkably rapid. The ‚Äúheap pointer‚Äù is simply moved forward into virgin territory, so it's
effectively the same as C++'s stack allocation. (Of course, there's a little extra overhead for
bookkeeping, but it's nothing like searching for storage.)

You might observe that the heap isn't in fact a conveyor belt, and if you treat it that way,
you'll start paging memory‚Äîmoving it on and off disk, so that you can appear to have more
memory than you actually do. Paging significantly impacts performance. Eventually, after
you create enough objects, you'll run out of memory. The trick is that the garbage collector
steps in, and while it collects the garbage it compacts all the objects in the heap so that you've
effectively moved the ‚Äúheap pointer‚Äù closer to the beginning of the conveyor belt and farther
away from a page fault. The garbage collector rearranges things and makes it possible for the
high-speed, infinite-free-heap model to be used while allocating storage.

To understand garbage collection in Java, it's helpful learn how garbage-collection schemes
work in other systems. A simple but slow garbage-collection technique is called reference
counting. This means that each object contains a reference counter, and every time a
reference is attached to that object, the reference count is increased. Every time a reference
goes out of scope or is set to null, the reference count is decreased. Thus, managing
reference counts is a small but constant overhead that happens throughout the lifetime of
your program. The garbage collector moves through the entire list of objects, and when it
finds one with a reference count of zero it releases that storage (however, reference counting
schemes often release an object as soon as the count goes to zero). The one drawback is that
if objects circularly refer to each other they can have nonzero reference counts while still
being garbage. Locating such self-referential groups requires significant extra work for the
garbage collector. Reference counting is commonly used to explain one kind of garbage
collection, but it doesn't seem to be used in any JVM implementations.

In faster schemes, garbage collection is not based on reference counting. Instead, it is based
on the idea that any non-dead object must ultimately be traceable back to a reference that
lives either on the stack or in static storage. The chain might go through several layers of
objects. Thus, if you start in the stack and in the static storage area and walk through all the
references, you'll find all the live objects. For each reference that you find, you must trace
into the object that it points to and then follow all the references in that object, tracing into
the objects they point to, etc., until you've moved through the entire Web that originated with
the reference on the stack or in static storage. Each object that you move through must still
be alive. Note that there is no problem with detached self-referential groups‚Äîthese are
simply not found, and are therefore automatically garbage.

In the approach described here, the JVM uses an adaptive garbage-collection scheme, and
what it does with the live objects that it locates depends on the variant currently being used.
One of these variants is stop-and-copy. This means that‚Äîfor reasons that will become
apparent‚Äîthe program is first stopped (this is not a background collection scheme). Then,
each live object is copied from one heap to another, leaving behind all the garbage. In
addition, as the objects are copied into the new heap, they are packed end-to-end, thus
compacting the new heap (and allowing new storage to simply be reeled off the end as
previously described).

Of course, when an object is moved from one place to another, all references that point at the
object must be changed. The reference that goes from the heap or the static storage area to
the object can be changed right away, but there can be other references pointing to this object
that will be encountered later during the ‚Äúwalk.‚Äù These are fixed up as they are found (you
could imagine a table that maps old addresses to new ones).

There are two issues that make these so-called ‚Äúcopy collectors‚Äù inefficient. The first is the
idea that you have two heaps and you slosh all the memory back and forth between these two
separate heaps, maintaining twice as much memory as you actually need. Some JVMs deal
with this by allocating the heap in chunks as needed and simply copying from one chunk to
another.

The second issue is the copying process itself. Once your program becomes stable, it might be
generating little or no garbage. Despite that, a copy collector will still copy all the memory
from one place to another, which is wasteful. To prevent this, some JVMs detect that no new
garbage is being generated and switch to a different scheme (this is the ‚Äúadaptive‚Äù part). This
other scheme is called mark-and-sweep, and it's what earlier versions of Sun's JVM used all
the time. For general use, mark-and-sweep is fairly slow, but when you know you're
generating little or no garbage, it's fast.

Mark-and-sweep follows the same logic of starting from the stack and static storage, and
tracing through all the references to find live objects. However, each time it finds a live
object, that object is marked by setting a flag in it, but the object isn't collected yet. Only
when the marking process is finished does the sweep occur. During the sweep, the dead
objects are released. However, no copying happens, so if the collector chooses to compact a
fragmented heap, it does so by shuffling objects around.

‚ÄúStop-and-copy‚Äù refers to the idea that this type of garbage collection is not done in the
background; instead, the program is stopped while the garbage collection occurs. In the Sun
literature you'll find many references to garbage collection as a low-priority background
process, but it turns out that the garbage collection was not implemented that way in earlier
versions of the Sun JVM. Instead, the Sun garbage collector stopped the program when
memory got low. Mark-and-sweep also requires that the program be stopped.

As previously mentioned, in the JVM described here memory is allocated in big blocks. If you
allocate a large object, it gets its own block. Strict stop-and-copy requires copying every live
object from the source heap to a new heap before you can free the old one, which translates
to lots of memory. With blocks, the garbage collection can typically copy objects to dead
blocks as it collects. Each block has a generation count to keep track of whether it's alive. In
the normal case, only the blocks created since the last garbage collection are compacted; all
other blocks get their generation count bumped if they have been referenced from
somewhere. This handles the normal case of lots of short-lived temporary objects.

Periodically, a full sweep is made‚Äîlarge objects are still not copied (they just get their
generation count bumped), and blocks containing small objects are copied and compacted.
The JVM monitors the efficiency of garbage collection and if it becomes a waste of time
because all objects are long-lived, then it switches to mark-andsweep. Similarly, the JVM
keeps track of how successful mark-and-sweep is, and if the heap starts to become
fragmented, it switches back to stop-and-copy. This is where the ‚Äúadaptive‚Äù part comes in,
so you end up with a mouthful: ‚ÄúAdaptive generational stop-and-copy mark-andsweep.‚Äù

There are a number of additional speedups possible in a JVM. An especially important one
involves the operation of the loader and what is called a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. A JIT
compiler partially or fully converts a program into native machine code so that it doesn't
need to be interpreted by the JVM and thus runs much faster. When a class must be loaded
(typically, the first time you want to create an object of that class), the .class file is located,
and the bytecodes for that class are brought into memory. At this point, one approach is to
simply JIT compile all the code, but this has two drawbacks: It takes a little more time,
which, compounded throughout the life of the program, can add up; and it increases the size
of the executable (bytecodes are significantly more compact than expanded JIT code), and
this might cause paging, which definitely slows down a program. An alternative approach is
lazy evaluation, which means that the code is not JIT compiled until necessary. Thus, code
that never gets executed might never be JIT compiled. The Java HotSpot technologies in
recent JDKs take a similar approach by increasingly optimizing a piece of code each time it is
executed, so the more the code is executed, the faster it gets.

## üçÄ07.06 Member initialization
Java goes out of its way to guarantee that variables are properly initialized before they are
used. In the case of a method's local variables, this guarantee comes in the form of a 
compile-time error. So if you say:
```java
void f() {
    int i;
    i++; // Error -- i not initialized
}
```
you'll get an error message that says that i might not have been initialized. Of course, the
compiler could have given i a default value, but an uninitialized local variable is probably a
programmer error, and a default value would have covered that up. Forcing the programmer
to provide an initialization value is more likely to catch a bug.

If a primitive is a field in a class, however, things are a bit different. As you saw in the
Everything Is an Object chapter, each primitive field of a class is guaranteed to get an initial
value. Here's a program that verifies this, and shows the values:

```java
//: initialization/InitialValues.java
// Shows default initial values.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class InitialValues {
    boolean t;
    char c;
    byte b;
    short s;
    int i;
    long l;
    float f;
    double d;
    InitialValues reference;
    void printInitialValues() {
        print("Data type Initial value");
        print("boolean " + t);
        print("char [" + c + "]");
        print("byte " + b);
        print("short " + s);
        print("int " + i);
        print("long " + l);
        print("float " + f);
        print("double " + d);
        print("reference " + reference);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InitialValues iv = new InitialValues();
        iv.printInitialValues();
        /* You could also say:
        new InitialValues().printInitialValues();
        */
    }
}/* Output:
Data type Initial value
boolean false
char [ ]
byte 0
short 0
int 0
long 0
float 0.0
double 0.0
reference null
*///:~
```
You can see that even though the values are not specified, they automatically get initialized
(the char value is a zero, which prints as a space). So at least there's no threat of working
with uninitialized variables.

When you define an object reference inside a class without initializing it to a new object, that
reference is given a special value of null.

### ‚òò Specifying initialization
What happens if you want to give a variable an initial value? One direct way to do this is
simply to assign the value at the point you define the variable in the class. (Notice you cannot
do this in C++, although C++ novices always try.) Here the field definitions in class
InitialValues are changed to provide initial values:

```java
//: initialization/InitialValues2.java
// Providing explicit initial values.

public class InitialValues2 {
    boolean bool = true;
    char ch = 'x';
    byte b = 47;
    short s = 0xff;
    int i = 999;
    long lng = 1;
    float f = 3.14f;
    double d = 3.14159;
} ///:~
```
You can also initialize non-primitive objects in this same way. If Depth is a class, you can
create a variable and initialize it like so:

```java
//: initialization/Measurement.java
class Depth {}

public class Measurement {
    Depth d = new Depth();
    // ...
} ///:~
```
If you haven't given d an initial value and you try to use it anyway, you'll get a runtime error
called an exception (covered in the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter).
You can even call a method to provide an initialization value:

```java
//: initialization/MethodInit.java
public class MethodInit {
    int i = f();
    int f() { return 11; }
} ///:~
```
This method can have arguments, of course, but those arguments cannot be other class
members that haven't been initialized yet. Thus, you can do this:

```java
//: initialization/MethodInit2.java
public class MethodInit2 {
    int i = f();
    int j = g(i);
    int f() { return 11; }
    int g(int n) { return n * 10; }
} ///:~
```
But you cannot do this:

```java
//: initialization/MethodInit3.java
public class MethodInit3 {
    //! int j = g(i); // Illegal forward reference
    int i = f();
    int f() { return 11; }
    int g(int n) { return n * 10; }
} ///:~
```
This is one place in which the compiler, appropriately, does complain about forward
referencing, since this has to do with the order of initialization and not the way the program
is compiled.

This approach to initialization is simple and straightforward. It has the limitation that every
object of type InitialValues will get these same initialization values. Sometimes this is
exactly what you need, but at other times you need more flexibility.

## üçÄ07.07 Constructor initialization
The constructor can be used to perform initialization, and this gives you greater flexibility in
your programming because you can call methods and perform actions at run time to
determine the initial values. There's one thing to keep in mind, however: You aren't
precluding the automatic initialization, which happens before the constructor is entered. So,
for example, if you say:

```java
//: initialization/Counter.java
public class Counter {
    int i;
    Counter() { i = 7; }
    // ...
} ///:~
```
then i will first be initialized to 0, then to 7. This is true with all the primitive types and
with object references, including those that are given explicit initialization at the point of
definition. For this reason, the compiler doesn't try to force you to initialize elements in the
constructor at any particular place, or before they are used‚Äîinitialization is already
guaranteed.

### ‚òò Order of initialization
Within a class, the order of initialization is determined by the order that the variables are
defined within the class. The variable definitions may be scattered throughout and in
between method definitions, but the variables are initialized before any methods can be
called‚Äîeven the constructor. For example:

```java
//: initialization/OrderOfInitialization.java
// Demonstrates initialization order.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Window {
    Window(int marker) { print("Window(" + marker + ")"); }
}

class House {
    Window w1 = new Window(1); // Before constructor
    House() {
        // Show that we're in the constructor:
        print("House()");
        w3 = new Window(33); // Reinitialize w3
    }
    Window w2 = new Window(2); // After constructor
    void f() { print("f()"); }
    Window w3 = new Window(3); // At end
}

public class OrderOfInitialization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        House h = new House();
        h.f(); // Shows that construction is done
    }
}// When the constructor is called to create a
// Window object, you'll see a message:
/* Output:
Window(1)
Window(2)
Window(3)
House()
Window(33)
f()
*///:~
```
In House, the definitions of the Window objects are intentionally scattered about to prove
that they'll all get initialized before the constructor is entered or anything else can happen. In
addition, w3 is reinitialized inside the constructor.

From the output, you can see that the w3 reference gets initialized twice: once before and
once during the constructor call. (The first object is dropped, so it can be garbage collected
later.) This might not seem efficient at first, but it guarantees proper initialization‚Äîwhat
would happen if an overloaded constructor were defined that did not initialize w3 and there
wasn't a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù initialization for w3 in its definition?

### ‚òò static data initialization
There's only a single piece of storage for a static, regardless of how many objects are created.
You can't apply the static keyword to local variables, so it only applies to fields. If a field 
is a static primitive and you don't initialize it, it gets the standard initial value for its type.
If it's a reference to an object, the default initialization value is null.
If you want to place initialization at the point of definition, it looks the same as for non-
statics.

To see when the static storage gets initialized, here's an example:

```java
//: initialization/StaticInitialization.java
// Specifying initial values in a class definition.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Bowl {
    Bowl(int marker) {
        print("Bowl(" + marker + ")");
    }
    void f1(int marker) {
        print("f1(" + marker + ")");
    }
}

class Table {
    static Bowl bowl1 = new Bowl(1);
    Table() {
        print("Table()");
        bowl2.f1(1);
    }
    void f2(int marker) {
        print("f2(" + marker + ")");
    }
    static Bowl bowl2 = new Bowl(2);
}

class Cupboard {
    Bowl bowl3 = new Bowl(3);
    static Bowl bowl4 = new Bowl(4);
    Cupboard() {
        print("Cupboard()");
        bowl4.f1(2);
    }
    void f3(int marker) {
        print("f3(" + marker + ")");
    }
    static Bowl bowl5 = new Bowl(5);
}

public class StaticInitialization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Creating new Cupboard() in main");
        new Cupboard();
        print("Creating new Cupboard() in main");
        new Cupboard();
        table.f2(1);
        cupboard.f3(1);
    }
    static Table table = new Table();
    static Cupboard cupboard = new Cupboard();
} /* Output:
Bowl(1)
Bowl(2)
Table()
f1(1)
Bowl(4)
Bowl(5)
Bowl(3)
Cupboard()
f1(2)
Creating new Cupboard() in main
Bowl(3)
Cupboard()
f1(2)
Creating new Cupboard() in main
Bowl(3)
Cupboard()
f1(2)
f2(1)
f3(1)
*///:~
```
Bowl allows you to view the creation of a class, and Table and Cupboard have static
members of Bowl scattered through their class definitions. Note that Cupboard creates a
non-static Bowl bowl3 prior to the static definitions.

From the output, you can see that the static initialization occurs only if it's necessary. If you
don't create a Table object and you never refer to Table.bowl1 or Table.bowl2, the static
Bowl bowl1 and bowl2 will never be created. They are initialized only when the first Table
object is created (or the first static access occurs). After that, the static objects are not
reinitialized.

The order of initialization is statics first, if they haven't already been initialized by a previous
object creation, and then the non-static objects. You can see the evidence of this in the
output. To execute main( ) (a static method), the StaticInitialization class must be
loaded, and its static fields table and cupboard are then initialized, which causes those
classes to be loaded, and since they both contain static Bowl objects, Bowl is then loaded.
Thus, all the classes in this particular program get loaded before main( ) starts. This is
usually not the case, because in typical programs you won't have everything linked together
by statics as you do in this example.

To summarize the process of creating an object, consider a class called Dog:
1. Even though it doesn't explicitly use the static keyword, the constructor is actually a
static method. So the first time an object of type Dog is created, or the first time a
static method or static field of class Dog is accessed, the Java interpreter must
locate Dog.class, which it does by searching through the classpath.

2. As Dog.class is loaded (creating a Class object, which you'll learn about later), all of
its static initializers are run. Thus, static initialization takes place only once, as the
Class object is loaded for the first time.

3. When you create a new Dog( ), the construction process for a Dog object first
allocates enough storage for a Dog object on the heap.

4. This storage is wiped to zero, automatically setting all the primitives in that Dog
object to their default values (zero for numbers and the equivalent for boolean and
char) and the references to null.

5. Any initializations that occur at the point of field definition are executed.

6. Constructors are executed. As you shall see in the Reusing Classes chapter, this might
actually involve a fair amount of activity, especially when inheritance is involved.

### ‚òò Explicit static initialization
Java allows you to group other static initializations inside a special ‚Äústatic clause‚Äù
(sometimes called a static block) in a class. It looks like this:

```java
//: initialization/Spoon.java
public class Spoon {
    static int i;
    static {
        i = 47;
    }
} ///:~
```
It appears to be a method, but it's just the static keyword followed by a block of code. This
code, like other static initializations, is executed only once: the first time you make an object
of that class or the first time you access a static member of that class (even if you never
make an object of that class). For example:

```java
//: initialization/ExplicitStatic.java
// Explicit static initialization with the "static" clause.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Cup {
    Cup(int marker) {
        print("Cup(" + marker + ")");
    }
    void f(int marker) {
        print("f(" + marker + ")");
    }
}

class Cups {
    static Cup cup1;
    static Cup cup2;
    static {
        cup1 = new Cup(1);
        cup2 = new Cup(2);
    }
    Cups() {
        print("Cups()");
    }
}

public class ExplicitStatic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Inside main()");
        Cups.cup1.f(99); // (1)
    }
    // static Cups cups1 = new Cups(); // (2)
    // static Cups cups2 = new Cups(); // (2)
} /* Output:
Inside main()
Cup(1)
Cup(2)
f(99)
*///:~
```
The static initializers for Cups run when either the access of the static object cup1 occurs
on the line marked (1), or if line (1) is commented out and the lines marked (2) are
uncommented. If both (1) and (2) are commented out, the static initialization for Cups
never occurs, as you can see from the output. Also, it doesn't matter if one or both of the 
lines marked (2) are uncommented; the static initialization only occurs once.

Exercise 13: (1) Verify the statements in the previous paragraph.

Exercise 14: (1) Create a class with a static String field that is initialized at the point of
definition, and another one that is initialized by the static block. Add a static method that
prints both fields and demonstrates that they are both initialized before they are used.

### ‚òò Non-static instance initialization
Java provides a similar syntax, called instance initialization, for initializing non-static
variables for each object. Here's an example:

```java
//: initialization/Mugs.java
// Java "Instance Initialization."
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Mug {
    Mug(int marker) {
        print("Mug(" + marker + ")");
    }
    void f(int marker) {
        print("f(" + marker + ")");
    }
}

public class Mugs {
    Mug mug1;
    Mug mug2; 
    {
        mug1 = new Mug(1);
        mug2 = new Mug(2);
        print("mug1 & mug2 initialized");
    }
    Mugs() {
        print("Mugs()");
    }
    Mugs(int i) {
        print("Mugs(int)");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Inside main()");
        new Mugs();
        print("new Mugs() completed");
        new Mugs(1);
        print("new Mugs(1) completed");
    }
} /* Output:
Inside main()
Mug(1)
Mug(2)
mug1 & mug2 initialized
Mugs()
new Mugs() completed
Mug(1)
Mug(2)
mug1 & mug2 initialized
Mugs(int)
new Mugs(1) completed
*///:~
```
You can see that the instance initialization clause:

    {
        mug1 = new Mug(1);
        mug2 = new Mug(2);
        print("mug1 & mug2 initialized");
    }

looks exactly like the static initialization clause except for the missing static keyword. This
syntax is necessary to support the initialization of anonymous inner classes (see the Inner
Classes chapter), but it also allows you to guarantee that certain operations occur regardless
of which explicit constructor is called. From the output, you can see that the instance
initialization clause is executed before either one of the constructors.

Exercise 15: (1) Create a class with a String that is initialized using instance
initialization.


## üçÄ07.08 Array initialization
An array is simply a sequence of either objects or primitives that are all the same type and are
packaged together under one identifier name. Arrays are defined and used with the square-
brackets indexing operator [ ]. To define an array reference, you simply follow your type
name with empty square brackets:

    int[] a1;

You can also put the square brackets after the identifier to produce exactly the same
meaning:

    int a1[];

This conforms to expectations from C and C++ programmers. The former style, however, is
probably a more sensible syntax, since it says that the type is ‚Äúan int array.‚Äù 
That style will be used in this book.

The compiler doesn't allow you to tell it how big the array is. This brings us back to that issue
of ‚Äúreferences.‚Äù All that you have at this point is a reference to an array (you've allocated
enough storage for that reference), and there's been no space allocated for the array object
itself. To create storage for the array, you must write an initialization expression. For arrays,
initialization can appear anywhere in your code, but you can also use a special kind of
initialization expression that must occur at the point where the array is created. This special
initialization is a set of values surrounded by curly braces. The storage allocation (the
equivalent of using new) is taken care of by the compiler in this case. For example:

    int[] a1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

So why would you ever define an array reference without an array?

    int[] a2;

Well, it's possible to assign one array to another in Java, so you can say:

    a2 = a1;

What you're really doing is copying a reference, as demonstrated here:

```java
//: initialization/ArraysOfPrimitives.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ArraysOfPrimitives {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        int[] a2;
        a2 = a1;
        for (int i = 0; i < a2.length; i++)
            a2[i] = a2[i] + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++)
            print("a1[" + i + "] = " + a1[i]);
    }
} /* Output:
a1[0] = 2
a1[1] = 3
a1[2] = 4
a1[3] = 5
a1[4] = 6
*///:~
```
You can see that a1 is given an initialization value but a2 is not; a2 is assigned later‚Äîin this
case, to another array. Since a2 and a1 are then aliased to the same array, the changes made
via a2 are seen in a1.

All arrays have an intrinsic member (whether they're arrays of objects or arrays of primitives)
that you can query‚Äîbut not change‚Äîto tell you how many elements there are in the array.
This member is length. Since arrays in Java, like C and C++, start counting from element
zero, the largest element you can index is length - 1. If you go out of bounds, C and C++
quietly accept this and allow you to stomp all over your memory, which is the source of many
infamous bugs. However, Java protects you against such problems by causing a runtime
error (an exception) if you step out of bounds. 5

5 Of course, checking every array access costs time and code and there's no way to turn it
off, which means that array accesses might be a source of inefficiency in your program if 
they occur at a critical juncture. For Internet security and programmer productivity, 
the Java designers saw that this was a worthwhile trade-off. Although you may be tempted 
to write code that you think might make array accesses more efficient, this is a waste of 
time because automatic compile-time and runtime optimizations will speed array accesses.

What if you don't know how many elements you're going to need in your array while you're
writing the program? You simply use new to create the elements in the array. Here, new
works even though it's creating an array of primitives (new won't create a non-array
primitive):

```java
//: initialization/ArrayNew.java
// Creating arrays with new.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ArrayNew {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a;
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        a = new int[rand.nextInt(20)];
        print("length of a = " + a.length);
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
    }
}/* Output:
length of a = 18
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
*///:~
```
The size of the array is chosen at random by using the Random.nextInt( ) method, which
produces a value between zero and that of its argument. Because of the randomness, it's clear
that array creation is actually happening at run time. In addition, the output of this program
shows that array elements of primitive types are automatically initialized to ‚Äúempty‚Äù values.
(For numerics and char, this is zero, and for boolean, it's false.)

The Arrays.toString( ) method, which is part of the standard java.util library, produces a
printable version of a one-dimensional array.

Of course, in this case the array could also have been defined and initialized in the same
statement:

    int[] a = new int[rand.nextInt(20)];

This is the preferred way to do it, if you can.
If you create a non-primitive array, you create an array of references. Consider the wrapper
type Integer, which is a class and not a primitive:

```java
//: initialization/ArrayClassObj.java
// Creating an array of nonprimitive objects.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ArrayClassObj {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        Integer[] a = new Integer[rand.nextInt(20)];
        print("length of a = " + a.length);
        for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
            a[i] = rand.nextInt(500); // Autoboxing
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
length of a = 18
[55, 193, 361, 461, 429, 368, 200, 22, 207, 288, 128, 51, 89, 309, 278,
498, 361, 20]
*///:~
```
Here, even after new is called to create the array:

    Integer[] a = new Integer[rand.nextInt(20)];

it's only an array of references, and the initialization is not complete until the reference itself
is initialized by creating a new Integer object (via autoboxing, in this case):

    a[i] = rand.nextInt(500);

If you forget to create the object, however, you'll get an exception at run time when you try to
use the empty array location.

It's also possible to initialize arrays of objects by using the curly brace-enclosed list. There are
two forms:

```java
//: initialization/ArrayInit.java
// Array initialization.
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayInit {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] a = {
            new Integer(1),
            new Integer(2),
            3, // Autoboxing
        };
        Integer[] b = new Integer[]{
            new Integer(1),
            new Integer(2),
            3, // Autoboxing
        };
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(b));
    }
} /* Output:
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
*///:~
```
In both cases, the final comma in the list of initializers is optional. (This feature makes for
easier maintenance of long lists.)

Although the first form is useful, it's more limited because it can only be used at the point
where the array is defined. You can use the second and third forms anywhere, even inside a
method call. For example, you could create an array of String objects to pass to the main( )
of another method, to provide alternate command-line arguments to that main( ):

```java
//: initialization/DynamicArray.java
// Array initialization.

public class DynamicArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Other.main(new String[]{ "fiddle", "de", "dum" });
    }
}

class Other {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(String s : args)
            System.out.print(s + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
fiddle de dum
*///:~
```
The array created for the argument of Other.main( ) is created at the point of the method
call, so you can even provide alternate arguments at the time of the call.

Exercise 16: (1) Create an array of String objects and assign a String to each element.
Print the array by using a for loop.

Exercise 17: (2) Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument. During
construction, print the argument. Create an array of object references to this class, but don't
actually create objects to assign into the array. When you run the program, notice whether
the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.

Exercise 18: (1) Complete the previous exercise by creating objects to attach to the array
of references.

### ‚òò Variable argument lists
The second form provides a convenient syntax to create and call methods that can produce
an effect similar to C's variable argument lists (known as ‚Äúvarargs‚Äù in C). These can include
unknown quantities of arguments as well as unknown types. Since all classes are ultimately
inherited from the common root class Object (a subject you will learn more about as this
book progresses), you can create a method that takes an array of Object and call it like this:

```java
//: initialization/VarArgs.java
// Using array syntax to create variable argument lists.

class A {}

public class VarArgs {
    static void printArray(Object[] args) {
        for (Object obj: args)
            System.out.print(obj + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printArray(new Object[] {
            new Integer(47), new Float(3.14), new Double(11.11)
        });
        printArray(new Object[] { "one", "two", "three" });
        printArray(new Object[] { new A(), new A(), new A() });
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
47 3.14 11.11
one two three
A@1a46e30 A@3e25a5 A@19821f
*///:~
```
You can see that print( ) takes an array of Object, then steps through the array using the
foreach syntax and prints each one. The standard Java library classes produce sensible
output, but the objects of the classes created here print the class name, followed by an '@'
sign and hexadecimal digits. Thus, the default behavior (if you don't define a toString( )
method for your class, which will be described later in the book) is to print the class name
and the address of the object.

You may see pre-Java SE5 code written like the above in order to produce variable argument
lists. In Java SE5, however, this long-requested feature was finally added, so you can now use
ellipses to define a variable argument list, as you can see in printArray( ):

```java
//: initialization/NewVarArgs.java
// Using array syntax to create variable argument lists.

public class NewVarArgs {
    static void printArray(Object...args) {
        for (Object obj: args)
            System.out.print(obj + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Can take individual elements:
        printArray(new Integer(47), new Float(3.14), new Double(11.11));
        printArray(47, 3.14 F, 11.11);
        printArray("one", "two", "three");
        printArray(new A(), new A(), new A());
        // Or an array:
        printArray((Object[]) new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });
        printArray(); // Empty list is OK
    }
} /* Output: (75% match)
47 3.14 11.11
47 3.14 11.11
one two three
A@1bab50a A@c3c749 A@150bd4d
1 2 3 4
*///:~
```
With varargs, you no longer have to explicitly write out the array syntax‚Äîthe compiler will
actually fill it in for you when you specify varargs. You're still getting an array, which is why
print( ) is able to use foreach to iterate through the array. However, it's more than just an
automatic conversion from a list of elements to an array. Notice the second-t0-last line in the
program, where an array of Integer (created using autoboxing) is cast to an Object array (to
remove a compiler warning) and passed to printArray( ). Clearly, the compiler sees that
this is already an array and performs no conversion on it. So if you have a group of items you
can pass them in as a list, and if you already have an array it will accept that as the variable
argument list.

The last line of the program shows that it's possible to pass zero arguments to a vararg list.
This is helpful when you have optional trailing arguments:

```java
//: initialization/OptionalTrailingArguments.java

public class OptionalTrailingArguments {
    static void f(int required, String...trailing) {
        System.out.print("required: " + required + " ");
        for (String s: trailing)
            System.out.print(s + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f(1, "one");
        f(2, "two", "three");
        f(0);
    }
} /* Output:
required: 1 one
required: 2 two three
required: 0
*///:~
```
This also shows how you can use varargs with a specified type other than Object. Here, all
the varargs must be String objects. It's possible to use any type of argument in varargs,
including a primitive type. The following example also shows that the vararg list becomes an
array, and if there's nothing in the list it's an array of size zero:

```java
//: initialization/VarargType.java

public class VarargType {
    static void f(Character...args) {
        System.out.print(args.getClass());
        System.out.println(" length " + args.length);
    }
    static void g(int...args) {
        System.out.print(args.getClass());
        System.out.println(" length " + args.length);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f('a');
        f();
        g(1);
        g();
        System.out.println("int[]: " + new int[0].getClass());
    }
} /* Output:
class [Ljava.lang.Character; length 1
class [Ljava.lang.Character; length 0
class [I length 1
class [I length 0
int[]: class [I
*///:~
```
The getClass( ) method is part of Object, and will be explored fully in the Type
Information chapter. It produces the class of an object, and when you print this class, you see
an encoded string representing the class type. The leading '[' indicates that this is an array of
the type that follows. The 'I' is for a primitive int; to double-check, I created an array of int
in the last line and printed its type. This verifies that using varargs does not depend on
autoboxing, but that it actually uses the primitive types.

Varargs do work in harmony with autoboxing, however. For example:

```java
//: initialization/AutoboxingVarargs.java

public class AutoboxingVarargs {
    public static void f(Integer...args) {
        for (Integer i: args)
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f(new Integer(1), new Integer(2));
        f(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
        f(10, new Integer(11), 12);
    }
} /* Output:
1 2
4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12
*///:~
```
Notice that you can mix the types together in a single argument list, and autoboxing
selectively promotes the int arguments to Integer.

Varargs complicate the process of overloading, although it seems safe enough at first:

```java
//: initialization/OverloadingVarargs.java

public class OverloadingVarargs {
    static void f(Character...args) {
        System.out.print("first");
        for (Character c: args)
            System.out.print(" " + c);
        System.out.println();
    }
    static void f(Integer...args) {
        System.out.print("second");
        for (Integer i: args)
            System.out.print(" " + i);
        System.out.println();
    }
    static void f(Long...args) {
        System.out.println("third");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f('a', 'b', 'c');
        f(1);
        f(2, 1);
        f(0);
        f(0 L);
        //! f(); // Won't compile -- ambiguous
    }
}/* Output:
first a b c
second 1
second 2 1
second 0
third
*///:~
```
In each case, the compiler is using autoboxing to match the overloaded method, and it calls
the most specifically matching method.

But when you call f( ) without arguments, it has no way of knowing which one to call.
Although this error is understandable, it will probably surprise the client programmer.
You might try solving the problem by adding a non-vararg argument to one of the methods:

```java
//: initialization/OverloadingVarargs2.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

public class OverloadingVarargs2 {
    static void f(float i, Character...args) {
        System.out.println("first");
    }
    static void f(Character...args) {
        System.out.print("second");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f(1, 'a');
        f('a', 'b');
    }
}///:~
```
The {CompileTimeError} comment tag excludes the file from this book's Ant build. If you
compile it by hand you'll see the error message:

    reference to f is ambiguous, both method f(float,java.lang.Character...) in
    OverloadingVarargs2 and method f(java.lang.Character...) in OverloadingVarargs2 match

If you give both methods a non-vararg argument, it works:

```java
//: initialization/OverloadingVarargs3.java

public class OverloadingVarargs3 {
    static void f(float i, Character...args) {
        System.out.println("first");
    }
    static void f(char c, Character...args) {
        System.out.println("second");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f(1, 'a');
        f('a', 'b');
    }
} /* Output:
first
second
*///:~
```
You should generally only use a variable argument list on one version of an overloaded
method. Or consider not doing it at all.

Exercise 19: (2) Write a method that takes a vararg String array. Verify that you can
pass either a comma-separated list of Strings or a String[] into this method.

Exercise 20: (1) Create a main( ) that uses varargs instead of the ordinary main( )
syntax. Print all the elements in the resulting args array. Test it with various numbers of
command-line arguments.

## üçÄ07.09 Enumerated types
An apparently small addition in Java SE5 is the enum keyword, which makes your life much
easier when you need to group together and use a set of enumerated types. In the past you
would have created a set of constant integral values, but these do not naturally restrict
themselves to your set and thus are riskier and more difficult to use. Enumerated types are a
common enough need that C, C++, and a number of other languages have always had them.

Before Java SE5, Java programmers were forced to know a lot and be quite careful when they
wanted to properly produce the enum effect. Now Java has enum, too, and it's much more
full-featured than what you find in C/C++. Here's a simple example:

```java
//: initialization/Spiciness.java

public enum Spiciness {
    NOT, MILD, MEDIUM, HOT, FLAMING
} ///:~
```
This creates an enumerated type called Spiciness with five named values. Because the
instances of enumerated types are constants, they are in all capital letters by convention (if
there are multiple words in a name, they are separated by underscores).

To use an enum, you create a reference of that type and assign it to an instance:

```java
//: initialization/SimpleEnumUse.java

public class SimpleEnumUse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Spiciness howHot = Spiciness.MEDIUM;
        System.out.println(howHot);
    }
} /* Output:
MEDIUM
*///:~
```
The compiler automatically adds useful features when you create an enum. For example, it
creates a toString( ) so that you can easily display the name of an enum instance, which is
how the print statement above produced its output. The compiler also creates an ordinal( )
method to indicate the declaration order of a particular enum constant, and a static
values( ) method that produces an array of values of the enum constants in the order that
they were declared:

```java
//: initialization/EnumOrder.java

public class EnumOrder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(Spiciness s : Spiciness.values())
            System.out.println(s + ", ordinal " + s.ordinal());
    }
} /* Output:
NOT, ordinal 0
MILD, ordinal 1
MEDIUM, ordinal 2
HOT, ordinal 3
FLAMING, ordinal 4
*///:~
```
Although enums appear to be a new data type, the keyword only produces some compiler
behavior while generating a class for the enum, so in many ways you can treat an enum as
if it were any other class. In fact, enums are classes and have their own methods.
An especially nice feature is the way that enums can be used inside switch statements:

```java
//: initialization/Burrito.java

public class Burrito {
    Spiciness degree;
    public Burrito(Spiciness degree) { this.degree = degree; }
    public void describe() {
        System.out.print("This burrito is ");
        switch (degree) {
            case NOT:
                System.out.println("not spicy at all.");
                break;
            case MILD:
            case MEDIUM:
                System.out.println("a little hot.");
                break;
            case HOT:
            case FLAMING:
            default:
                System.out.println("maybe too hot.");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Burrito
        plain = new Burrito(Spiciness.NOT),
            greenChile = new Burrito(Spiciness.MEDIUM),
            jalapeno = new Burrito(Spiciness.HOT);
        plain.describe();
        greenChile.describe();
        jalapeno.describe();
    }
}/* Output:
This burrito is not spicy at all.
This burrito is a little hot.
This burrito is maybe too hot.
*///:~
```
Since a switch is intended to select from a limited set of possibilities, it's an ideal match for
an enum. Notice how the enum names can produce a much clearer indication of what the
program means to do.

In general you can use an enum as if it were another way to create a data type, and then just
put the results to work. That's the point, so you don't have to think too hard about them.
Before the introduction of enum in Java SE5, you had to go to a lot of effort to make an
equivalent enumerated type that was safe to use.

This is enough for you to understand and use basic enums, but we'll look more deeply at
them later in the book‚Äîthey have their own chapter: Enumerated Types.

Exercise 21: (1) Create an enum of the least-valuable six types of paper currency. Loop
through the values( ) and print each value and its ordinal( ).

Exercise 22: (2) Write a switch statement for the enum in the previous example. For
each case, output a description of that particular currency.

## üçÄ07.10 Summary
This seemingly elaborate mechanism for initialization, the constructor, should give you a
strong hint about the critical importance placed on initialization in the language. As Bjarne
Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, was designing that language, one of the first observations he
made about productivity in C was that improper initialization of variables causes a significant
portion of programming problems. These kinds of bugs are hard to find, and similar issues
apply to improper cleanup. Because constructors allow you to guarantee proper initialization
and cleanup (the compiler will not allow an object to be created without the proper
constructor calls), you get complete control and safety.

In C++, destruction is quite important because objects created with new must be explicitly
destroyed. In Java, the garbage collector automatically releases the memory for all objects, so
the equivalent cleanup method in Java isn't necessary much of the time (but when it is, you
must do it yourself). In cases where you don't need destructor-like behavior, Java's garbage
collector greatly simplifies programming and adds much-needed safety in managing
memory. Some garbage collectors can even clean up other resources like graphics and file
handles. However, the garbage collector does add a runtime cost, the expense of which is
difficult to put into perspective because of the historical slowness of Java interpreters.
Although Java has had significant performance increases over time, the speed problem has
taken its toll on the adoption of the language for certain types of programming problems.
Because of the guarantee that all objects will be constructed, there's actually more to the
constructor than what is shown here. In particular, when you create new classes using either
composition or inheritance, the guarantee of construction also holds, and some additional
syntax is necessary to support this. You'll learn about composition, inheritance, and how they
affect constructors in future chapters.

# üìú 08. Access Control
Access control (or implementation hiding) is about ‚Äúnot getting it
right the first time.‚Äù

All good writers‚Äîincluding those who write software‚Äîknow that a piece of work isn't good
until it's been rewritten, often many times. If you leave a piece of code in a drawer for 
a while and come back to it, you may see a much better way to do it. This is one of the prime
motivations for refactoring, which rewrites working code in order to make it more readable,
understandable, and thus maintainable. ¬π

¬π See Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, by Martin Fowler, et al. 
(Addison-Wesley, 1999). Occasionally someone will argue against refactoring, suggesting 
that code which works is perfectly good and it's a waste of time to refactor it. 
The problem with this way of thinking is that the lion's share of a project's time and 
money is not in the initial writing of the code, but in maintaining it. Making code easier 
to understand translates into very significant dollars.

There is a tension, however, in this desire to change and improve your code. There are often
consumers (client programmers) who rely on some aspect of your code staying the same. So
you want to change it; they want it to stay the same. Thus a primary consideration in object-
oriented design is to ‚Äúseparate the things that change from the things that stay the same.‚Äù
This is particularly important for libraries. Consumers of that library must rely on the part
they use, and know that they won't need to rewrite code if a new version of the library comes
out. On the flip side, the library creator must have the freedom to make modifications and
improvements with the certainty that the client code won't be affected by those changes.
This can be achieved through convention. For example, the library programmer must agree
not to remove existing methods when modifying a class in the library, since that would break
the client programmer's code. The reverse situation is thornier, however. In the case of a
field, how can the library creator know which fields have been accessed by client
programmers? This is also true with methods that are only part of the implementation of a
class, and not meant to be used directly by the client programmer. What if the library creator
wants to rip out an old implementation and put in a new one? Changing any of those
members might break a client programmer's code. Thus the library creator is in a strait jacket
and can't change anything.

To solve this problem, Java provides access specifiers to allow the library creator to say what
is available to the client programmer and what is not. The levels of access control from ‚Äúmost
access‚Äù to ‚Äúleast access‚Äù are public, protected, package access (which has no keyword), and
private. From the previous paragraph you might think that, as a library designer, you'll want
to keep everything as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù as possible, and expose only the methods that you want the
client programmer to use. This is exactly right, even though it's often counterintuitive for
people who program in other languages (especially C) and who are used to accessing
everything without restriction. By the end of this chapter you should be convinced of the
value of access control in Java.

The concept of a library of components and the control over who can access the components
of that library is not complete, however. There's still the question of how the components are
bundled together into a cohesive library unit. This is controlled with the package keyword in
Java, and the access specifiers are affected by whether a class is in the same package or in a
separate package. So to begin this chapter, you'll learn how library components are placed
into packages. Then you'll be able to understand the complete meaning of the access
specifiers.

## üçÄ08.01 package: the library unit
A package contains a group of classes, organized together under a single namespace.
For example, there's a utility library that's part of the standard Java distribution, organized
under the namespace java.util. One of the classes in java.util is called ArrayList. One way
to use an ArrayList is to specify the full name java.util.ArrayList.

```java
//: access/FullQualification.java

public class FullQualification {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.util.ArrayList list = new java.util.ArrayList();
    }
} ///:~
```
This rapidly becomes tedious, so you'll probably want to use the import keyword instead. If
you want to import a single class, you can name that class in the import statement:

```java
//: access/SingleImport.java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class SingleImport {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList list = new java.util.ArrayList();
    }
} ///:~
```
Now you can use ArrayList with no qualification. However, none of the other classes in
java.util are available. To import everything, you simply use the `*` as you've been seeing in
the rest of the examples in this book:

    import java.util.*;

The reason for all this importing is to provide a mechanism to manage namespaces. The
names of all your class members are insulated from each other. A method f( ) inside a class A
will not clash with an f( ) that has the same signature in class B. But what about the class
names? Suppose you create a Stack class that is installed on a machine that already has a
Stack class that's written by someone else? This potential clashing of names is why it's
important to have complete control over the namespaces in Java, and to create a unique
identifier combination for each class.

Most of the examples thus far in this book have existed in a single file and have been
designed for local use, so they haven't bothered with package names. These examples have
actually been in packages: the ‚Äúunnamed‚Äù or default package. This is certainly an option, and
for simplicity's sake this approach will be used whenever possible throughout the rest of this
book. However, if you're planning to create libraries or programs that are friendly to other
Java programs on the same machine, you must think about preventing class name clashes.

When you create a source-code file for Java, it's commonly called a **compilation unit**
(sometimes a translation unit). Each compilation unit must have a name ending in .java,
and inside the compilation unit there can be a public class that must have the same name as
the file (including capitalization, but excluding the .java file name extension). There can be
only one public class in each compilation unit; otherwise, the compiler will complain. If
there are additional classes in that compilation unit, they are hidden from the world outside
that package because they're not public, and they comprise ‚Äúsupport‚Äù classes for the main
public class.

### ‚òò Code organization
When you compile a .java file, you get an output file for each class in the .java file. Each
output file has the name of a class in the .java file, but with an extension of .class. Thus 
you can end up with quite a few .class files from a small number of .java files. If you've
programmed with a compiled language, you might be used to the compiler spitting out an
intermediate form (usually an ‚Äúobj‚Äù file) that is then packaged together with others of its kind
using a linker (to create an executable file) or a librarian (to create a library). That's not how
Java works. A working program is a bunch of .class files, which can be packaged and
compressed into a Java ARchive (JAR) file (using Java's jar archiver). The Java interpreter is
responsible for finding, loading, and interpreting ¬≤ these files.

¬≤ There's nothing in Java that forces the use of an interpreter. There exist native-code 
Java compilers that generate a single executable file.

A library is a group of these class files. Each source file usually has a public class and any
number of non-public classes, so there's one public component for each source file. If you
want to say that all these components (each in its own separate .java and .class files) belong
together, that's where the package keyword comes in.

If you use a package statement, it must appear as the first non-comment in the file. When
you say:

    package access;

you're stating that this compilation unit is part of a library named access. Put another way,
you're saying that the public class name within this compilation unit is under the umbrella
of the name access, and anyone who wants to use that name must either fully specify the
name or use the import keyword in combination with access, using the choices given
previously. (Note that the convention for Java package names is to use all lowercase letters,
even for intermediate words.)

For example, suppose the name of the file is MyClass.java. This means there can be one
and only one public class in that file, and the name of that class must be MyClass
(including the capitalization):

```java
//: access/mypackage/MyClass.java
package access.mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    // ...
} ///:~
```
Now, if someone wants to use MyClass or, for that matter, any of the other public classes in
access, they must use the import keyword to make the name or names in access available.
The alternative is to give the fully qualified name:

```java
//: access/QualifiedMyClass.java

public class QualifiedMyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        access.mypackage.MyClass m =
            new access.mypackage.MyClass();
    }
} ///:~
```


The import keyword can make this much cleaner:

```java
//: access/ImportedMyClass.java
import access.mypackage.*;

public class ImportedMyClass {
public static void main(String[] args) {
MyClass m = new MyClass();
}
} ///:~
```
It's worth keeping in mind that what the package and import keywords allow you to do, as
a library designer, is to divide up the single global namespace so you won't have clashing
names, no matter how many people get on the Internet and start writing classes in Java.

### ‚òò Creating unique package names
You might observe that, since a package never really gets ‚Äúpackaged‚Äù into a single file, a
package can be made up of many .class files, and things could get a bit cluttered. To prevent
this, a logical thing to do is to place all the .class files for a particular package into a single
directory; that is, use the hierarchical file structure of the operating system to your
advantage. This is one way that Java references the problem of clutter; you'll see the other
way later when the jar utility is introduced.

Collecting the package files into a single subdirectory solves two other problems: creating
unique package names, and finding those classes that might be buried in a directory
structure someplace. This is accomplished by encoding the path of the location of the .class
file into the name of the package. By convention, the first part of the package name is the
reversed Internet domain name of the creator of the class. Since Internet domain names are
guaranteed to be unique, if you follow this convention, your package name will be unique
and you'll never have a name clash. (That is, until you lose the domain name to someone else
who starts writing Java code with the same path names as you did.) Of course, if you don't
have your own domain name, then you must fabricate an unlikely combination (such as your
first and last name) to create unique package names. If you've decided to start publishing
Java code, it's worth the relatively small effort to get a domain name.

The second part of this trick is resolving the package name into a directory on your
machine, so that when the Java program runs and it needs to load the .class file, it can
locate the directory where the .class file resides.

The Java interpreter proceeds as follows. First, it finds the environment variable
CLASSPATH ¬≥ (set via the operating system, and sometimes by the installation program that
installs Java or a Java-based tool on your machine). CLASSPATH contains one or more
directories that are used as roots in a search for .class files. Starting at that root, the
interpreter will take the package name and replace each dot with a slash to generate a path
name off of the CLASSPATH root (so package `foo.bar.baz` becomes `foo\bar\baz` or
`foo/bar/baz` or possibly something else, depending on your operating system). This is then
concatenated to the various entries in the CLASSPATH. That's where it looks for the .class
file with the name corresponding to the class you're trying to create. (It also searches some
standard directories relative to where the Java interpreter resides.)

¬≥ When referring to the environment variable, capital letters will be used (CLASSPATH).

To understand this, consider my domain name, which is MindView.net. By reversing this
and making it all lowercase, net.mindview establishes my unique global name for my
classes. (The com, edu, org, etc., extensions were formerly capitalized in Java packages, but
this was changed in Java 2 so the entire package name is lowercase.) I can further subdivide
this by deciding that I want to create a library named simple, so I'll end up with a package
name:

    package net.mindview.simple;

Now this package name can be used as an umbrella namespace for the following two files:

```java
//: net/mindview/simple/Vector.java
// Creating a package.
package net.mindview.simple;

public class Vector {
    public Vector() {
        System.out.println("net.mindview.simple.Vector");
    }
} ///:~
```
As mentioned before, the package statement must be the first non-comment code in the file.
The second file looks much the same:

```java
//: net/mindview/simple/List.java
// Creating a package.
package net.mindview.simple;

public class List {
    public List() {
        System.out.println("net.mindview.simple.List");
    }
} ///:~
```
Both of these files are placed in the subdirectory on my system:

    C:\DOC\JavaT\net\mindview\simple

(Notice that the first comment line in every file in this book establishes the directory location
of that file in the source-code tree‚Äîthis is used by the automatic code-extraction tool for this
book.)

If you walk back through this path, you can see the package name net.mindview.simple,
but what about the first portion of the path? That's taken care of by the CLASSPATH
environment variable, which is, on my machine:

    CLASSPATH=.;D:\JAVA\LIB;C:\DOC\JavaT

You can see that the CLASSPATH can contain a number of alternative search paths.
There's a variation when using JAR files, however. You must put the actual name of the JAR
file in the classpath, not just the path where it's located. So for a JAR named grape.jar your
classpath would include:

    CLASSPATH=.;D:\JAVA\LIB;C:\flavors\grape.jar

Once the classpath is set up properly, the following file can be placed in any directory:

```java
//: access/LibTest.java
// Uses the library.
import net.mindview.simple.*;

public class LibTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector v = new Vector();
        List l = new List();
    }
} /* Output:
net.mindview.simple.Vector
net.mindview.simple.List
*///:~
```
When the compiler encounters the import statement for the simple library, it begins
searching at the directories specified by CLASSPATH, looking for subdirectory
net/mindview/simple, then seeking the compiled files of the appropriate names
(Vector.class for Vector, and List.class for List). Note that both the classes and the
desired methods in Vector and List must be public.

Setting the CLASSPATH has been such a trial for beginning Java users (it was for me, when I
started) that Sun made the JDK in later versions of Java a bit smarter. You'll find that when
you install it, even if you don't set the CLASSPATH, you'll be able to compile and run basic
Java programs. To compile and run the source-code package for this book (available at
www.MindView.net), however, you will need to add the base directory of the book's code
tree to your CLASSPATH.

Exercise 1: (1) Create a class in a package. Create an instance of your class outside of that
package.

### ‚òò Collisions
What happens if two libraries are imported via `*` and they include the same names? For
example, suppose a program does this:

    import net.mindview.simple.*;
    import java.util.*;

Since java.util.* also contains a Vector class, this causes a potential collision. However, as
long as you don't write the code that actually causes the collision, everything is OK‚Äîthis is
good, because otherwise you might end up doing a lot of typing to prevent collisions that
would never happen.

The collision does occur if you now try to make a Vector:

    Vector v = new Vector();

Which Vector class does this refer to? The compiler can't know, and the reader can't know
either. So the compiler complains and forces you to be explicit. If I want the standard Java
Vector, for example, I must say:

    java.util.Vector v = new java.util.Vector();

Since this (along with the CLASSPATH) completely specifies the location of that Vector,
there's no need for the import java.util.* statement unless I'm using something else from
java.util.

Alternatively, you can use the single-class import form to prevent clashes‚Äîas long as you
don't use both colliding names in the same program (in which case you must fall back to fully
specifying the names).

Exercise 2: (1) Take the code fragments in this section and turn them into a program,
and verify that collisions do in fact occur.

### ‚òò A custom tool library
With this knowledge, you can now create your own libraries of tools to reduce or eliminate
duplicate code. Consider, for example, the alias we've been using for
System.out.println( ), to reduce typing. This can be part of a class called Print so that you
end up with a readable static import:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Print.java
// Print methods that can be used without
// qualifiers, using Java SE5 static imports:
package net.mindview.util;
import java.io.*;

public class Print {
    // Print with a newline:
    public static void print(Object obj) {
        System.out.println(obj);
    }
    // Print a newline by itself:
    public static void print() {
        System.out.println();
    }
    // Print with no line break:
    public static void printnb(Object obj) {
        System.out.print(obj);
    }
    // The new Java SE5 printf() (from C):
    public static PrintStream
    printf(String format, Object...args) {
        return System.out.printf(format, args);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can use the printing shorthand to print anything, either with a newline (print( )) or
without a newline (printnb( )).

You can guess that the location of this file must be in a directory that starts at one of the
CLASSPATH locations, then continues into net/mindview. After compiling, the static
print( ) and printnb( ) methods can be used anywhere on your system with an import
static statement:

```java
//: access/PrintTest.java
// Uses the static printing methods in Print.java.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PrintTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Available from now on!");
        print(100);
        print(100L);
        print(3.14159);
    }
} /* Output:
Available from now on!
100
100
3.14159
*///:~
```
A second component of this library can be the range( ) methods, introduced in the
Controlling Execution chapter, that allow the use of the foreach syntax for simple integer
sequences:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Range.java
// Array creation methods that can be used without
// qualifiers, using Java SE5 static imports:
package net.mindview.util;

public class Range {
    // Produce a sequence [0..n)
    public static int[] range(int n) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            result[i] = i;
        return result;
    }
    // Produce a sequence [start..end)
    public static int[] range(int start, int end) {
        int sz = end - start;
        int[] result = new int[sz];
        for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++)
            result[i] = start + i;
        return result;
    }
    // Produce a sequence [start..end) incrementing by step
    public static int[] range(int start, int end, int step) {
        int sz = (end - start) / step;
        int[] result = new int[sz];
        for (int i = 0; i < sz; i++)
            result[i] = start + (i * step);
        return result;
    }
} ///:~
```
From now on, whenever you come up with a useful new utility, you can add it to your own
library. You'll see more components added to the net.mindview.util library throughout the
book.

### ‚òò Using imports to change behavior
A feature that is missing from Java is C's conditional compilation, which allows you to
change a switch and get different behavior without changing any other code. The reason such
a feature was left out of Java is probably because it is most often used in C to solve cross-
platform issues: Different portions of the code are compiled depending on the target
platform. Since Java is intended to be automatically cross-platform, such a feature should
not be necessary.

However, there are other valuable uses for conditional compilation. A very common use is for
debugging code. The debugging features are enabled during development and disabled in the
shipping product. You can accomplish this by changing the package that's imported in order
to change the code used in your program from the debug version to the production version.
This technique can be used for any kind of conditional code.

Exercise 3: (2) Create two packages: debug and debugoff, containing an identical class
with a debug( ) method. The first version displays its String argument to the console, the
second does nothing. Use a static import line to import the class into a test program, and
demonstrate the conditional compilation effect.

### ‚òò Package caveat
It's worth remembering that anytime you create a package, you implicitly specify a directory
structure when you give the package a name. The package must live in the directory indicated
by its name, which must be a directory that is searchable starting from the CLASSPATH.
Experimenting with the package keyword can be a bit frustrating at first, because unless you
adhere to the package-name to directory-path rule, you'll get a lot of mysterious runtime
messages about not being able to find a particular class, even if that class is sitting there in
the same directory. If you get a message like this, try commenting out the package
statement, and if it runs, you'll know where the problem lies.

Note that compiled code is often placed in a different directory than source code, but the path
to the compiled code must still be found by the JVM using the CLASSPATH.

## üçÄ08.02 Java access specifiers
The Java access specifiers public, protected, and private are placed in front of each
definition for each member in your class, whether it's a field or a method. Each access
specifier only controls the access for that particular definition.

If you don't provide an access specifier, it means ‚Äúpackage access.‚Äù So one way or another,
everything has some kind of access control. In the following sections, you'll learn about the
various types of access.

### ‚òò Package access
All the examples before this chapter used no access specifiers. The default access has no
keyword, but it is commonly referred to as package access (and sometimes ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù). It
means that all the other classes in the current package have access to that member, but to all
the classes outside of this package, the member appears to be private. Since a compilation
unit‚Äîa file‚Äîcan belong only to a single package, all the classes within a single compilation
unit are automatically available to each other via package access.

Package access allows you to group related classes together in a package so that they can
easily interact with each other. When you put classes together in a package, thus granting
mutual access to their package-access members, you ‚Äúown‚Äù the code in that package. It
makes sense that only code that you own should have package access to other code that you
own. You could say that package access gives a meaning or a reason for grouping classes
together in a package. In many languages the way you organize your definitions in files can
be arbitrary, but in Java you're compelled to organize them in a sensible fashion. In addition,
you'll probably want to exclude classes that shouldn't have access to the classes being defined
in the current package.

The class controls the code that has access to its members. Code from another package can't
just come around and say, ‚ÄúHi, I'm a friend of Bob's!‚Äù and expect to be shown the
protected, package-access, and private members of Bob. The only way to grant access to a
member is to:

1. Make the member `public`. Then everybody, everywhere, can access it.

2. Give the member package access by leaving off any access specifier, and put the other
classes in the same package. Then the other classes in that package can access the
member.

3. As you'll see in the Reusing Classes chapter, when inheritance is introduced, an
inherited class can access a protected member as well as a public member (but not
private members). It can access package-access members only if the two classes are
in the same package. But don't worry about inheritance and protected right now.

4. Provide ‚Äúaccessor/mutator‚Äù methods (also known as ‚Äúget/set‚Äù methods) that read and
change the value. This is the most civilized approach in terms of OOP, and it is
fundamental to JavaBeans, as you'll see in the Graphical User Interfaces chapter.

### ‚òò public: interface access
When you use the public keyword, it means that the member declaration that immediately
follows public is available to everyone, in particular to the client programmer who uses the
library. Suppose you define a package dessert containing the following compilation unit:

```java
//: access/dessert/Cookie.java
// Creates a library.
package access.dessert;

public class Cookie {
    public Cookie() {
        System.out.println("Cookie constructor");
    }
    void bite() { System.out.println("bite"); }
} ///:~
```
Remember, the class file produced by Cookie.java must reside in a subdirectory called
dessert, in a directory under access (indicating the Access Control chapter of this book)
that must be under one of the CLASSPATH directories. Don't make the mistake of thinking
that Java will always look at the current directory as one of the starting points for searching.
If you don't have a '.' as one of the paths in your CLASSPATH, Java won't look there.
Now if you create a program that uses Cookie:

```java
//: access/Dinner.java
// Uses the library.
import access.dessert.*;

public class Dinner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cookie x = new Cookie();
        //! x.bite(); // Can't access
    }
} /* Output:
Cookie constructor
*///:~
```
you can create a Cookie object, since its constructor is public and the class is public. (We'll
look more at the concept of a public class later.) However, the bite( ) member is
inaccessible inside Dinner.java since bite( ) provides access only within package dessert,
so the compiler prevents you from using it.

### ‚òò The default package
You might be surprised to discover that the following code compiles, even though it would
appear that it breaks the rules:

```java
//: access/Cake.java
// Accesses a class in a separate compilation unit.

class Cake {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pie x = new Pie();
        x.f();
    }
} /* Output:
Pie.f()
*///:~
```
In a second file in the same directory:

```java
//: access/Pie.java
// The other class.

class Pie {
    void f() { System.out.println("Pie.f()"); }
} ///:~
```
You might initially view these as completely foreign files, and yet Cake is able to create a Pie
object and call its f( ) method. (Note that you must have '.' in your CLASSPATH in order for
the files to compile.) You'd typically think that Pie and f( ) have package access and are
therefore not available to Cake. They do have package access‚Äîthat part is correct. The
reason that they are available in Cake.java is because they are in the same directory and
have no explicit package name. Java treats files like this as implicitly part of the ‚Äúdefault
package‚Äù for that directory, and thus they provide package access to all the other files in that
directory.

### ‚òò private: you can't touch that!
The private keyword means that no one can access that member except the class that
contains that member, inside methods of that class. Other classes in the same package cannot
access private members, so it's as if you're even insulating the class against yourself. On the
other hand, it's not unlikely that a package might be created by several people collaborating
together, so private allows you to freely change that member without concern that it will
affect another class in the same package.

The default package access often provides an adequate amount of hiding; remember, a
packageaccess member is inaccessible to the client programmer using the class. This is nice,
since the default access is the one that you normally use (and the one that you'll get if you
forget to add any access control). Thus, you'll typically think about access for the members
that you explicitly want to make public for the client programmer, and as a result, you might
initially think that you won't use the private keyword very often, since it's tolerable to get
away without it. However, it turns out that the consistent use of private is very important,
especially where multithreading is concerned. (As you'll see in the Concurrency chapter.)
Here's an example of the use of private:

```java
//: access/IceCream.java
// Demonstrates "private" keyword.

class Sundae {
    private Sundae() {}
    static Sundae makeASundae() {
        return new Sundae();
    }
}

public class IceCream {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //! Sundae x = new Sundae();
        Sundae x = Sundae.makeASundae();
    }
} ///:~
```
This shows an example in which private comes in handy: You might want to control how an
object is created and prevent someone from directly accessing a particular constructor (or all
of them). In the preceding example, you cannot create a Sundae object via its constructor;
instead, you must call the makeASundae( ) method to do it for you. ‚Å¥

‚Å¥ There's another effect in this case: Since the default constructor is the only one defined,
and it's private, it will prevent inheritance of this class. (A subject that will be introduced later.)

Any method that you're certain is only a ‚Äúhelper‚Äù method for that class can be made private,
to ensure that you don't accidentally use it elsewhere in the package and thus prohibit
yourself from changing or removing the method. Making a method private guarantees that
you retain this option.

The same is true for a private field inside a class. Unless you must expose the underlying
implementation (which is less likely than you might think), you should make all fields
private. However, just because a reference to an object is private inside a class doesn't
mean that some other object can't have a public reference to the same object. (See the online
supplements for this book to learn about aliasing issues.)

### ‚òò protected: inheritance access
Understanding the protected access specifier requires a jump ahead. First, you should be
aware that you don't need to understand this section to continue through this book up
through inheritance (the Reusing Classes chapter). But for completeness, here is a brief
description and example using protected.

The protected keyword deals with a concept called inheritance, which takes an existing
class‚Äî which we refer to as the base class‚Äîand adds new members to that class without
touching the existing class. You can also change the behavior of existing members of the
class. To inherit from a class, you say that your new class extends an existing class, like this:

    class Foo extends Bar {

The rest of the class definition looks the same.

If you create a new package and inherit from a class in another package, the only members
you have access to are the public members of the original package. (Of course, if you
perform the inheritance in the same package, you can manipulate all the members that have
package access.) Sometimes the creator of the base class would like to take a particular
member and grant access to derived classes but not the world in general. That's what
protected does. protected also gives package access‚Äîthat is, other classes in the same
package may access protected elements.

If you refer back to the file Cookie.java, the following class cannot call the package-access
member bite( ):

```java
//: access/ChocolateChip.java
// Can't use package-access member from another package.
import access.dessert.*;

public class ChocolateChip extends Cookie {
    public ChocolateChip() {
        System.out.println("ChocolateChip constructor");
    }
    public void chomp() {
        //! bite(); // Can't access bite
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChocolateChip x = new ChocolateChip();
        x.chomp();
    }
} /* Output:
Cookie constructor
ChocolateChip constructor
*///:~
```
One of the interesting things about inheritance is that if a method bite( ) exists in class
Cookie, then it also exists in any class inherited from Cookie. But since bite( ) has package
access and is in a foreign package, it's unavailable to us in this one. Of course, you could
make it public, but then everyone would have access, and maybe that's not what you want. If
you change the class Cookie as follows:

```java
//: access/cookie2/Cookie.java
package access.cookie2;

public class Cookie {
    public Cookie() {
        System.out.println("Cookie constructor");
    }
    protected void bite() {
        System.out.println("bite");
    }
} ///:~
```
now bite( ) becomes accessible to anyone inheriting from Cookie:

```java
//: access/ChocolateChip2.java
import access.cookie2.*;

public class ChocolateChip2 extends Cookie {
    public ChocolateChip2() {
        System.out.println("ChocolateChip2 constructor");
    }
    public void chomp() { bite(); } // Protected method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChocolateChip2 x = new ChocolateChip2();
        x.chomp();
    }
} /* Output:
Cookie constructor
ChocolateChip2 constructor
bite
*///:~
```
Note that, although bite( ) also has package access, it is not public.

Exercise 4: (2) Show that protected methods have package access but are not public.

Exercise 5: (2) Create a class with public, private, protected, and package-access
fields and method members. Create an object of this class and see what kind of compiler
messages you get when you try to access all the class members. Be aware that classes in the
same directory are part of the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù package.

Exercise 6: (1) Create a class with protected data. Create a second class in the same file
with a method that manipulates the protected data in the first class.

## üçÄ08.03 Interface and implementation
Access control is often referred to as implementation hiding. Wrapping data and methods
within classes in combination with implementation hiding is often called encapsulation. ‚Åµ 
The result is a data type with characteristics and behaviors.

‚Åµ However, people often refer to implementation hiding alone as encapsulation.

Access control puts boundaries within a data type for two important reasons. The first is to
establish what the client programmers can and can't use. You can build your internal
mechanisms into the structure without worrying that the client programmers will
accidentally treat the internals as part of the interface that they should be using.

This feeds directly into the second reason, which is to separate the interface from the
implementation. If the structure is used in a set of programs, but client programmers can't
do anything but send messages to the public interface, then you are free to change anything
that's not public (e.g., package access, protected, or private) without breaking client code.
For clarity, you might prefer a style of creating classes that puts the public members at the
beginning, followed by the protected, package-access, and private members. The
advantage is that the user of the class can then read down from the top and see first what's
important to them (the public members, because they can be accessed outside the file), and
stop reading when they encounter the non-public members, which are part of the internal
implementation:

```java
//: access/OrganizedByAccess.java

public class OrganizedByAccess {
    public void pub1() { /* ... */ }
    public void pub2() { /* ... */ }
    public void pub3() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv1() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv2() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv3() { /* ... */ }
    private int i;
    // ...
} ///:~
```
This will make it only partially easier to read, because the interface and implementation are
still mixed together. That is, you still see the source code‚Äîthe implementation‚Äîbecause it's
right there in the class. In addition, the comment documentation supported by Javadoc
lessens the importance of code readability by the client programmer. Displaying the interface
to the consumer of a class is really the job of the class browser, a tool whose job is to look at
all the available classes and show you what you can do with them (i.e., what members are

available) in a useful fashion. In Java, viewing the JDK documentation with a Web browser
gives you the same effect as a class browser.

### ‚òò Class access
In Java, the access specifiers can also be used to determine which classes within a library will
be available to the users of that library. If you want a class to be available to a client
programmer, you use the public keyword on the entire class definition. This controls
whether the client programmer can even create an object of the class.

To control the access of a class, the specifier must appear before the keyword class. Thus you
can say:

    public class Widget {

Now if the name of your library is access, any client programmer can access Widget by
saying

    import access.Widget;
or

    import access.*;

However, there's an extra set of constraints:
1. There can be **only one public class per compilation unit (file)**. The idea is that each
compilation unit has a single public interface represented by that public class. It can
have as many supporting package-access classes as you want. If you have more than
one public class inside a compilation unit, the compiler will give you an error
message.

2. The name of the public class must exactly match the name of the file containing the
compilation unit, including capitalization. So for Widget, the name of the file must be
Widget.java, not widget.java or WIDGET.java. Again, you'll get a compile-time
error if they don't agree.

3. It is possible, though not typical, to have a compilation unit with no public class at
all. In this case, you can name the file whatever you like (although naming it
arbitrarily will be confusing to people reading and maintaining the code).

What if you've got a class inside access that you're only using to accomplish the tasks
performed by Widget or some other public class in access? You don't want to go to the
bother of creating documentation for the client programmer, and you think that sometime
later you might want to completely change things and rip out your class altogether,
substituting a different one. To give you this flexibility, you need to ensure that no client
programmers become dependent on your particular implementation details hidden inside
access. To accomplish this, you just leave the public keyword off the class, in which case it
has package access. (That class can be used only within that package.)

Exercise 7: (1) Create the library according to the code fragments describing access and
Widget. Create a Widget in a class that is not part of the access package.

When you create a package-access class, it still makes sense to make the fields of the class
private‚Äîyou should always make fields as private as possible‚Äîbut it's generally reasonable
to give the methods the same access as the class (package access). Since a package-access
class is usually used only within the package, you only need to make the methods of such a
class public if you're forced to, and in those cases, the compiler will tell you.

Note that a class cannot be private (that would make it inaccessible to anyone but the class)
or protected. ‚Å∂ So you have only two choices for class access: package access or public. If
you don't want anyone else to have access to that class, you can make all the constructors
private, thereby preventing anyone but you, inside a static member of the class, from
creating an object of that class. Here's an example:

‚Å∂ Actually, an inner class can be private or protected, but that's a special case. 
These will be introduced in the InnerClasses chapter.

```java
//: access/Lunch.java
// Demonstrates class access specifiers. Make a class
// effectively private with private constructors:

class Soup1 {
    private Soup1() {}
    // (1) Allow creation via static method:
    public static Soup1 makeSoup() {
        return new Soup1();
    }
}

class Soup2 {
    private Soup2() {}
    // (2) Create a static object and return a reference
    // upon request.(The "Singleton" pattern):
    private static Soup2 ps1 = new Soup2();
    public static Soup2 access() {
        return ps1;
    }
    public void f() {}
}

// Only one public class allowed per file:
public class Lunch {
    void testPrivate() {
        // Can't do this! Private constructor:
        //! Soup1 soup = new Soup1();
    }
    void testStatic() {
        Soup1 soup = Soup1.makeSoup();
    }
    void testSingleton() {
        Soup2.access().f();
    }
} ///:~
```
Up to now, most of the methods have been returning either void or a primitive type, so the
definition:

    public static Soup1 makeSoup() {
        return new Soup1();
    }

might look a little confusing at first. The word Soup1 before the method name (makeSoup)
tells what the method returns. So far in this book, this has usually been void, which means it
returns nothing. But you can also return a reference to an object, which is what happens
here. This method returns a reference to an object of class Soup1.

The classes Soup1 and Soup2 show how to prevent direct creation of a class by making all
the constructors private. Remember that if you don't explicitly create at least one
constructor, the default constructor (a constructor with no arguments) will be created for
you. By writing the default constructor, it won't be created automatically. By making it
private, no one can create an object of that class. But now how does anyone use this class?
The preceding example shows two options. In Soup1, a static method is created that creates
a new Soup1 and returns a reference to it. This can be useful if you want to do some extra
operations on the Soup1 before returning it, or if you want to keep count of how many
Soup1 objects to create (perhaps to restrict their population).

Soup2 uses what's called a design pattern, which is covered in Thinking in Patterns (with
Java) at www.MindView.net. This particular pattern is called a Singleton, because it allows
only a single object to ever be created. The object of class Soup2 is created as a static
private member of Soup2, so there's one and only one, and you can't get at it except
through the public method access( ).

As previously mentioned, if you don't put an access specifier for class access, it defaults to
package access. This means that an object of that class can be created by any other class in
the package, but not outside the package. (Remember, all the files within the same directory
that don't have explicit package declarations are implicitly part of the default package for
that directory.) However, if a static member of that class is public, the client programmer
can still access that static member even though they cannot create an object of that class.
Exercise 8: (4) Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called
ConnectionManager that manages a fixed array of Connection objects. The client
programmer must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects, but can only get them
via a static method in ConnectionManager. When the ConnectionManager runs out of
objects, it returns a null reference. Test the classes in main( ).

Exercise 9: (2) Create the following file in the access/local directory (presumably in
your CLASSPATH):
```java
// access/local/PackagedClass.java
package access.local;

class PackagedClass {
    public PackagedClass() {
        System.out.println("Creating a packaged class");
    }
}
```
Then create the following file in a directory other than access/local:
```java
// access/foreign/Foreign.java
package access.foreign;
import access.local.*;

public class Foreign {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PackagedClass pc = new PackagedClass();
    }
}
```
Explain why the compiler generates an error. Would making the Foreign class part of the
access.local package change anything?

## üçÄ08.04 Summary
In any relationship it's important to have boundaries that are respected by all parties
involved. When you create a library, you establish a relationship with the user of that
library‚Äîthe client programmer‚Äîwho is another programmer, but one using your library to
build an application or a bigger library.

Without rules, client programmers can do anything they want with all the members of a
class, even if you might prefer they don't directly manipulate some of the members.
Everything's naked to the world.

This chapter looked at how classes are built to form libraries: first, the way a group of classes
is packaged within a library, and second, the way the class controls access to its members.
It is estimated that a C programming project begins to break down somewhere between 50K
and 100K lines of code because C has a single namespace, and names begin to collide,
causing extra management overhead. In Java, the package keyword, the package naming
scheme, and the import keyword give you complete control over names, so the issue of
name collision is easily avoided.

There are two reasons for controlling access to members. The first is to keep users' hands off
portions that they shouldn't touch. These pieces are necessary for the internal operations of
the class, but not part of the interface that the client programmer needs. So making methods
and fields private is a service to client programmers, because they can easily see what's
important to them and what they can ignore. It simplifies their understanding of the class.
The second and most important reason for access control is to allow the library designer to
change the internal workings of the class without worrying about how it will affect the client
programmer. You might, for example, build a class one way at first, and then discover that
restructuring your code will provide much greater speed. If the interface and implementation
are clearly separated and protected, you can accomplish this without forcing client
programmers to rewrite their code. Access control ensures that no client programmer
becomes dependent on any part of the underlying implementation of a class.

When you have the ability to change the underlying implementation, you not only have the
freedom to improve your design, you also have the freedom to make mistakes. No matter
how carefully you plan and design, you'll make mistakes. Knowing that it's relatively safe to
make these mistakes means you'll be more experimental, you'll learn more quickly, and you'll
finish your project sooner.

The public interface to a class is what the user does see, so that is the most important part of
the class to get ‚Äúright‚Äù during analysis and design. Even that allows you some leeway for
change. If you don't get the interface right the first time, you can add more methods, as long
as you don't remove any that client programmers have already used in their code.

Notice that access control focuses on a relationship‚Äîand a kind of communication‚Äîbetween
a library creator and the external clients of that library. There are many situations where this
is not the case. For example, you are writing all the code yourself, or you are working in close
quarters with a small team and everything goes into the same package. These situations have
a different kind of communication, and rigid adherence to access rules may not be optimal.
Default (package) access may be just fine.

# üìú 09. Reusing Classes 
One of the most compelling features about Java is code reuse. But to
be revolutionary, you've got to be able to do a lot more than copy code
and change it.

That's the approach used in procedural languages like C, and it hasn't worked very well. Like
everything in Java, the solution revolves around the class. You reuse code by creating new
classes, but instead of creating them from scratch, you use existing classes that someone has
already built and debugged.

The trick is to use the classes without soiling the existing code. In this chapter you'll see two
ways to accomplish this. The first is quite straightforward: you simply create objects of your
existing class inside the new class. This is called composition, because the new class is
composed of objects of existing classes. You're simply reusing the functionality of the code,
not its form.

The second approach is more subtle. It creates a new class as a type of an existing class. You
literally take the form of the existing class and add code to it without modifying the existing
class. This technique is called inheritance, and the compiler does most of the work.
Inheritance is one of the cornerstones of object-oriented programming, and has additional
implications that will be explored in the Polymorphism chapter.

It turns out that much of the syntax and behavior are similar for both composition and
inheritance (which makes sense because they are both ways of making new types from
existing types). In this chapter, you'll learn about these code reuse mechanisms.

## üçÄ09.01 Composition syntax
Composition has been used quite frequently up to this point in the book. You simply place
object references inside new classes. For example, suppose you'd like an object that holds
several String objects, a couple of primitives, and an object of another class. For the non-
primitive objects, you put references inside your new class, but you define the primitives
directly:

```java
//: reusing/SprinklerSystem.java
// Composition for code reuse.
class WaterSource {
    private String s;
    WaterSource() {
        System.out.println("WaterSource()");
        s = "Constructed";
    }
    public String toString() { return s; }
}

public class SprinklerSystem {
    private String valve1, valve2, valve3, valve4;
    private WaterSource source = new WaterSource();
    private int i;
    private float f;
    public String toString() {
        return

        "valve1 = " + valve1 + " " +
            "valve2 = " + valve2 + " " +
            "valve3 = " + valve3 + " " +
            "valve4 = " + valve4 + "\n" +
            "i = " + i + " " + "f = " + f + " " +
            "source = " + source;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SprinklerSystem sprinklers = new SprinklerSystem();
        System.out.println(sprinklers);
    }
}
/* Output:
WaterSource()
valve1 = null valve2 = null valve3 = null valve4 = null
i = 0 f = 0.0 source = Constructed
*/ //:
```
One of the methods defined in both classes is special: `toString( )`. Every non-primitive
object has a `toString( )` method, and it's called in special situations when the compiler
wants a String but it has an object. So in the expression in `SprinklerSystem.toString( )`:

    "source = " + source;

the compiler sees you trying to add a String object ("source = ") to a WaterSource.
Because you can only ‚Äúadd‚Äù a String to another String, it says ‚ÄúI'll turn source into a
String by calling toString( )!‚Äù After doing this it can combine the two Strings and pass the
resulting String to System.out.println( ) (or equivalently, this book's print() and
printnb( ) static methods). Any time you want to allow this behavior with a class you
create, you need only write a toString( ) method.

Primitives that are fields in a class are automatically initialized to zero, as noted in the
Everything Is an Object chapter. But the object references are initialized to null, and if you
try to call methods for any of them, you'll get an exception-a runtime error. Conveniently,
you can still print a null reference without throwing an exception.

It makes sense that the compiler doesn't just create a default object for every reference,
because that would incur unnecessary overhead in many cases. If you want the references
initialized, you can do it:
1. At the point the objects are defined. This means that they'll always be initialized
before the constructor is called.

2. In the constructor for that class.

3. Right before you actually need to use the object. This is often called lazy
initialization. It can reduce overhead in situations where object creation is expensive
and the object doesn't need to be created every time.

4. Using instance initialization.

All four approaches are shown here:

```java
//: reusing/Bath.java
// Constructor initialization with composition.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Soap {
    private String s;
    Soap() {
        print("Soap()");
        s = "Constructed";
    }
    public String toString() { return s; }
}

public class Bath {
    private String // Initializing at point of definition:
    s1 = "Happy",
        s2 = "Happy",
        s3, s4;
    private Soap castille;
    private int i;
    private float toy;
    public Bath() {
        print("Inside Bath()");
        s3 = "Joy";
        toy = 3.14 f;
        castille = new Soap();
    }
    // Instance initialization:
    { i = 47; }
    public String toString() {
        if (s4 == null) // Delayed initialization:
            s4 = "Joy";
        return "s1 = " + s1 + "\n" +
            "s2 = " + s2 + "\n" +
            "s3 = " + s3 + "\n" +
            "s4 = " + s4 + "\n" +
            "i = " + i + "\n" +
            "toy = " + toy + "\n" +
            "castille = " + castille;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bath b = new Bath();
        print(b);
    }
} /* Output:
Inside Bath()
Soap()
s1 = Happy
s2 = Happy
s3 = Joy
s4 = Joy
i = 47
toy = 3.14
castille = Constructed
*///:~
```
Note that in the Bath constructor, a statement is executed before any of the initializations
take place. When you don't initialize at the point of definition, there's still no guarantee that
you'll perform any initialization before you send a message to an object reference‚Äîexcept for
the inevitable run-time exception.

When toString( ) is called it fills in s4 so that all the fields are properly initialized by the
time they are used.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a simple class. Inside a second class, define a reference to an object
of the first class. Use lazy initialization to instantiate this object.

## üçÄ09.02 Inheritance syntax
Inheritance is an integral part of Java (and all OOP languages). It turns out that you're
always doing inheritance when you create a class, because unless you explicitly inherit from
some other class, you implicitly inherit from Java's standard root class Object.

The syntax for composition is obvious, but to perform inheritance there's a distinctly
different form. When you inherit, you say ‚ÄúThis new class is like that old class.‚Äù You state
this in code before the opening brace of the class body, using the keyword extends followed by
the name of the base class. When you do this, you automatically get all the fields and
methods in the base class. Here's an example:

```java
//: reusing/Detergent.java
// Inheritance syntax & properties.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Cleanser {
    private String s = "Cleanser";
    public void append(String a) { s += a; }
    public void dilute() { append(" dilute()"); }
    public void apply() { append(" apply()"); }
    public void scrub() { append(" scrub()"); }
    public String toString() { return s; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cleanser x = new Cleanser();
        x.dilute();
        x.apply();
        x.scrub();
        print(x);
    }
}

public class Detergent extends Cleanser {
    // Change a method:
    public void scrub() {
        append(" Detergent.scrub()");
        super.scrub(); // Call base-class version
    }
    // Add methods to the interface:
    public void foam() { append(" foam()"); }
    // Test the new class:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Detergent x = new Detergent();
        x.dilute();
        x.apply();
        x.scrub();
        x.foam();
        print(x);
        print("Testing base class:");
        Cleanser.main(args);
    }
} /* Output:
Cleanser dilute() apply() Detergent.scrub() scrub() foam()
Testing base class:
Cleanser dilute() apply() scrub()
*///:~
```
This demonstrates a number of features. First, in the Cleanser append( ) method, Strings
are concatenated to s using the += operator, which is one of the operators (along with '+')
that the Java designers ‚Äúoverloaded‚Äù to work with Strings.

Second, both Cleanser and Detergent contain a main( ) method. You can create a
main( ) for each one of your classes; this technique of putting a main() in each class allows
easy testing for each class. And you don't need to remove the main() when you're finished;
you can leave it in for later testing.

Even if you have a lot of classes in a program, only the main( ) for the class invoked on the
command line will be called. So in this case, when you say java Detergent,
Detergent.main( ) will be called. But you can also say java Cleanser to invoke
Cleanser.main( ), even though Cleanser is not a public class. Even if a class has package
access, a public main() is accessible.

Here, you can see that Detergent.main( ) calls Cleanser.main( ) explicitly, passing it the
same arguments from the command line (however, you could pass it any String array).

It's important that all of the methods in Cleanser are public. Remember that if you leave
off any access specifier, the member defaults to package access, which allows access only to
package members. Thus, within this package, anyone could use those methods if there were
no access specifier. Detergent would have no trouble, for example. However, if a class from
some other package were to inherit from Cleanser, it could access only public members. So
to allow for inheritance, as a general rule make all fields private and all methods public.
(protected members also allow access by derived classes; you'll learn about this later.) Of
course, in particular cases you must make adjustments, but this is a useful guideline.

Cleanser has a set of methods in its interface: append( ), dilute( ), apply( ), scrub( ),
and toString( ). Because Detergent is derived from Cleanser (via the extends keyword),
it automatically gets all these methods in its interface, even though you don't see them all
explicitly defined in Detergent. You can think of inheritance, then, as reusing the class.

As seen in scrub( ), it's possible to take a method that's been defined in the base class and
modify it. In this case, you might want to call the method from the base class inside the new
version. But inside scrub( ), you cannot simply call scrub( ), since that would produce a
recursive call, which isn't what you want. To solve this problem, Java has the keyword super
that refers to the ‚Äúsuperclass‚Äù that the current class inherits. Thus the expression
super.scrub( ) calls the base-class version of the method scrub( ).

When inheriting you're not restricted to using the methods of the base class. You can also
add new methods to the derived class exactly the way you put any method in a class: Just
define it. The method foam( ) is an example of this.

In Detergent.main( ) you can see that for a Detergent object, you can call all the methods
that are available in Cleanser as well as in Detergent (i.e., foam( )).
Exercise 2: (2) Inherit a new class from class Detergent. Override scrub( ) and add a
new method called sterilize( ).

### ‚òò Initializing the base class
Since there are now two classes involved‚Äîthe base class and the derived class‚Äîinstead of
just one, it can be a bit confusing to try to imagine the resulting object produced by a derived
class. From the outside, it looks like the new class has the same interface as the base class
and maybe some additional methods and fields. But inheritance doesn't just copy the
interface of the base class. When you create an object of the derived class, it contains within it
a subobject of the base class. This subobject is the same as if you had created an object of the
base class by itself. It's just that from the outside, the subobject of the base class is wrapped
within the derived-class object.

Of course, it's essential that the base-class subobject be initialized correctly, and there's only
one way to guarantee this: Perform the initialization in the constructor by calling the base-
class constructor, which has all the appropriate knowledge and privileges to perform the
base-class initialization. Java automatically inserts calls to the base-class constructor in the
derived-class constructor. The following example shows this working with three levels of
inheritance:

```java
//: reusing/Cartoon.java
// Constructor calls during inheritance.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Art {
    Art() { print("Art constructor"); }
}

class Drawing extends Art {
    Drawing() { print("Drawing constructor"); }
}

public class Cartoon extends Drawing {
    public Cartoon() { print("Cartoon constructor"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cartoon x = new Cartoon();
    }
} /* Output:
Art constructor
Drawing constructor
Cartoon constructor
*///:~
```
You can see that the construction happens from the base ‚Äúoutward,‚Äù so the base class is
initialized before the derived-class constructors can access it. Even if you don't create a
constructor for Cartoon( ), the compiler will synthesize a default constructor for you that
calls the base class constructor.

Exercise 3: (2) Prove the previous sentence.

Exercise 4: (2) Prove that the base-class constructors are (a) always called and (b) called
before derived-class constructors.

Exercise 5: (1) Create two classes, A and B, with default constructors (empty argument
lists) that announce themselves. Inherit a new class called C from A, and create a member of
class B inside C. Do not create a constructor for C. Create an object of class C and observe
the results.

### ‚òò Constructors with arguments
The preceding example has default constructors; that is, they don't have any arguments. It's
easy for the compiler to call these because there's no question about what arguments to pass.
If your class doesn't have default arguments, or if you want to call a base-class constructor
that has an argument, you must explicitly write the calls to the base-class constructor using
the super keyword and the appropriate argument list:

```java
//: reusing/Chess.java
// Inheritance, constructors and arguments.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Game {
    Game(int i) {
        print("Game constructor");
    }
}

class BoardGame extends Game {
    BoardGame(int i) {
        super(i);
        print("BoardGame constructor");
    }
}

public class Chess extends BoardGame {
    Chess() {
        super(11);
        print("Chess constructor");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Chess x = new Chess();
    }
} /* Output:
Game constructor
BoardGame constructor
Chess constructor
*///:~
```
If you don't call the base-class constructor in BoardGame( ), the compiler will complain
that it can't find a constructor of the form Game( ). In addition, the call to the base-class
constructor must be the first thing you do in the derived-class constructor. (The compiler will
remind you if you get it wrong.)

Exercise 6: (1) Using Chess.java, prove the statements in the previous paragraph.
Exercise 7: (1) Modify Exercise 5 so that A and B have constructors with arguments
instead of default constructors. Write a constructor for C and perform all initialization within
C's constructor.

Exercise 8: (1) Create a base class with only a non-default constructor, and a derived
class with both a default (no-arg) and non-default constructor. In the derived-class
constructors, call the base-class constructor.

Exercise 9: (2) Create a class called Root that contains an instance of each of the classes
(that you also create) named Component1, Component2, and Component3. Derive a
class Stem from Root that also contains an instance of each ‚Äúcomponent.‚Äù All classes should
have default constructors that print a message about that class.

Exercise 10: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that each class only has non-default
constructors.

## üçÄ09.03 Delegation
A third relationship, which is not directly supported by Java, is called delegation. This is
midway between inheritance and composition, because you place a member object in the
class you're building (like composition), but at the same time you expose all the methods
from the member object in your new class (like inheritance). For example, a spaceship needs
a control module:

```java
//: reusing/SpaceShipControls.java

public class SpaceShipControls {
    void up(int velocity) {}
    void down(int velocity) {}
    void left(int velocity) {}
    void right(int velocity) {}
    void forward(int velocity) {}
    void back(int velocity) {}
    void turboBoost() {}
} ///:~
```
One way to build a spaceship is to use inheritance:

```java
//: reusing/SpaceShip.java

public class SpaceShip extends SpaceShipControls {
    private String name;
    public SpaceShip(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String toString() { return name; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpaceShip protector = new SpaceShip("NSEA Protector");
        protector.forward(100);
    }
} ///:~
```
However, a SpaceShip isn't really ‚Äúa type of‚Äù SpaceShipControls, even if, for example,
you ‚Äútell‚Äù a SpaceShip to go forward( ). It's more accurate to say that a SpaceShip
contains SpaceShipControls, and at the same time all the methods in
SpaceShipControls are exposed in a SpaceShip. Delegation solves the dilemma:

```java
//: reusing/SpaceShipDelegation.java

public class SpaceShipDelegation {
    private String name;
    private SpaceShipControls controls =
        new SpaceShipControls();
    public SpaceShipDelegation(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    // Delegated methods:
    public void back(int velocity) {
        controls.back(velocity);
    }
    public void down(int velocity) {
        controls.down(velocity);
    }
    public void forward(int velocity) {
        controls.forward(velocity);
    }
    public void left(int velocity) {
        controls.left(velocity);
    }
    public void right(int velocity) {
        controls.right(velocity);
    }
    public void turboBoost() {
        controls.turboBoost();
    }
    public void up(int velocity) {
        controls.up(velocity);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpaceShipDelegation protector =
            new SpaceShipDelegation("NSEA Protector");
        protector.forward(100);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see how the methods are forwarded to the underlying controls object, and the
interface is thus the same as it is with inheritance. However, you have more control with
delegation because you can choose to provide only a subset of the methods in the member
object.

Although the Java language doesn't support delegation, development tools often do. The
above example, for instance, was automatically generated using the JetBrains Idea IDE.
Exercise 11: (3) Modify Detergent.java so that it uses delegation.

## üçÄ09.04 Combining composition and inheritance
It is very common to use composition and inheritance together. The following example shows
the creation of a more complex class, using both inheritance and composition, along with the
necessary constructor initialization:

```java
//: reusing/PlaceSetting.java
// Combining composition & inheritance.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Plate {
    Plate(int i) {
        print("Plate constructor");
    }
}

class DinnerPlate extends Plate {
    DinnerPlate(int i) {
        super(i);
        print("DinnerPlate constructor");
    }
}

class Utensil {
    Utensil(int i) {
        print("Utensil constructor");
    }
}

class Spoon extends Utensil {
    Spoon(int i) {
        super(i);
        print("Spoon constructor");
    }
}

class Fork extends Utensil {

Although the compiler forces you to initialize the base classes, and requires that you do it
right at the beginning of the constructor, it doesn't watch over you to make sure that you
initialize the member objects, so you must remember to pay attention to that.

It's rather amazing how cleanly the classes are separated. You don't even need the source
code for the methods in order to reuse the code. At most, you just import a package. (This is
true for both inheritance and composition.)

### ‚òò Guaranteeing proper cleanup
Java doesn't have the C++ concept of a destructor, a method that is automatically called
when an object is destroyed. The reason is probably that in Java, the practice is simply to
forget about objects rather than to destroy them, allowing the garbage collector to reclaim the
memory as necessary.

Often this is fine, but there are times when your class might perform some activities during
its lifetime that require cleanup. As mentioned in the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, you
can't know when the garbage collector will be called, or if it will be called. So if you want
something cleaned up for a class, you must explicitly write a special method to do it, and
make sure that the client programmer knows that they must call this method. On top of
this‚Äîas described in the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter‚Äîyou must guard against
an exception by putting such cleanup in a finally clause.

Consider an example of a computer-aided design system that draws pictures on the screen:

```java
//: reusing/CADSystem.java
// Ensuring proper cleanup.
package reusing;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Shape {
    Shape(int i) { print("Shape constructor"); }
    void dispose() { print("Shape dispose"); }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    Circle(int i) {
        super(i);
        print("Drawing Circle");
    }
    void dispose() {
        print("Erasing Circle");
        super.dispose();
    }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
    Triangle(int i) {
        super(i);
        print("Drawing Triangle");
    }
    void dispose() {
        print("Erasing Triangle");
        super.dispose();
    }
}

class Line extends Shape {
    private int start, end;
    Line(int start, int end) {
        super(start);
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        print("Drawing Line: " + start + ", " + end);
    }
    void dispose() {
        print("Erasing Line: " + start + ", " + end);
        super.dispose();
    }
}

public class CADSystem extends Shape {
    private Circle c;
    private Triangle t;
    private Line[] lines = new Line[3];
    public CADSystem(int i) {
        super(i + 1);
        for (int j = 0; j < lines.length; j++)
            lines[j] = new Line(j, j * j);
        c = new Circle(1);
        t = new Triangle(1);
        print("Combined constructor");
    }
    public void dispose() {
        print("CADSystem.dispose()");
        // The order of cleanup is the reverse
        // of the order of initialization:
        t.dispose();
        c.dispose();
        for (int i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            lines[i].dispose();
        super.dispose();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CADSystem x = new CADSystem(47);
        try {
            // Code and exception handling...
        } finally {
            x.dispose();
        }
    }
} /* Output:

```
Everything in this system is some kind of Shape (which is itself a kind of Object, since it's
implicitly inherited from the root class). Each class overrides Shape's dispose( ) method in
addition to calling the base-class version of that method using super. The specific Shape
classes‚ÄîCircle, Triangle, and Line‚Äîall have constructors that ‚Äúdraw,‚Äù although any
method called during the lifetime of the object could be responsible for doing something that
needs cleanup. Each class has its own dispose( ) method to restore non-memory things
back to the way they were before the object existed.

In main( ), you can see two keywords that are new, and won't be explained until the Error
Handling with Exceptions chapter: try and finally. The try keyword indicates that the block
that follows (delimited by curly braces) is a guarded region, which means that it is given
special treatment. One of these special treatments is that the code in the finally clause
following this guarded region is always executed, no matter how the try block exits. (With
exception handling, it's possible to leave a try block in a number of non-ordinary ways.)
Here, the finally clause is saying ‚Äúalways call dispose( ) for x, no matter what happens.‚Äù
Note that in your cleanup method, you must also pay attention to the calling order for the
base-class and member-object cleanup methods in case one subobject depends on another.

In general, you should follow the same form that is imposed by a C++ compiler on its
destructors: First perform all of the cleanup work specific to your class, in the reverse order
of creation. (In general, this requires that base-class elements still be viable.) Then call the
base-class cleanup method, as demonstrated here.

There can be many cases in which the cleanup issue is not a problem; you just let the garbage
collector do the work. But when you must do it explicitly, diligence and attention are
required, because there's not much you can rely on when it comes to garbage collection. The
garbage collector might never be called. If it is, it can reclaim objects in any order it wants.
You can't rely on garbage collection for anything but memory reclamation. If you want
cleanup to take place, make your own cleanup methods and don't use on finalize( ).
Exercise 12: (3) Add a proper hierarchy of dispose( ) methods to all the classes in
Exercise 9.

### ‚òò Name hiding
If a Java base class has a method name that's overloaded several times, redefining that
method name in the derived class will not hide any of the base-class versions (unlike C++).
Thus overloading works regardless of whether the method was defined at this level or in a
base class:

```java
//: reusing/Hide.java
// Overloading a base-class method name in a derived
// class does not hide the base-class versions.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Homer {
    char doh(char c) {
        print("doh(char)");
        return 'd';
    }
    float doh(float f) {
        print("doh(float)");
        return 1.0 f;
    }
}

class Milhouse {}

class Bart extends Homer {
    void doh(Milhouse m) {
        print("doh(Milhouse)");
    }
}

public class Hide {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bart b = new Bart();
        b.doh(1);
        b.doh('x');
        b.doh(1.0 f);
        b.doh(new Milhouse());
    }
}/* Output:
doh(float)
doh(char)
doh(float)
doh(Milhouse)
*///:~
```
You can see that all the overloaded methods of Homer are available in Bart, even though
Bart introduces a new overloaded method (in C++ doing this would hide the base-class
methods). As you'll see in the next chapter, it's far more common to override methods of the
same name, using exactly the same signature and return type as in the base class. It can be
confusing otherwise (which is why C++ disallows it‚Äîto prevent you from making what is
probably a mistake).

Java SE5 has added the @Override annotation, which is not a keyword but can be used as if
it were. When you mean to override a method, you can choose to add this annotation and the
compiler will produce an error message if you accidentally overload instead of overriding.

```java
//: reusing/Lisa.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

class Lisa extends Homer {
    @Override void doh(Milhouse m) {
        System.out.println("doh(Milhouse)");
    }
} ///:~
```
The {CompileTimeError} tag excludes the file from this book's Ant build, but if you
compile it by hand you'll see the error message:

    method does not override a method from its superclass

The @Override annotation will thus prevent you from accidentally overloading when you
don't mean to.

Exercise 13: (2) Create a class with a method that is overloaded three times. Inherit a
new class, add a new overloading of the method, and show that all four methods are available
in the derived class.


## üçÄ09.05 Choosing composition vs. inheritance
Both composition and inheritance allow you to place subobjects inside your new class
(composition explicitly does this‚Äîwith inheritance it's implicit). You might wonder about the
difference between the two, and when to choose one over the other.

Composition is generally used when you want the features of an existing class inside your
new class, but not its interface. That is, you embed an object so that you can use it to
implement features in your new class, but the user of your new class sees the interface you've
defined for the new class rather than the interface from the embedded object. For this effect,
you embed private objects of existing classes inside your new class.

Sometimes it makes sense to allow the class user to directly access the composition of your
new class; that is, to make the member objects public. The member objects use
implementation hiding themselves, so this is a safe thing to do. When the user knows you're
assembling a bunch of parts, it makes the interface easier to understand. A car object is a
good example:

```java
//: reusing/Car.java
// Composition with public objects.

class Engine {
    public void start() {}
    public void rev() {}
    public void stop() {}
}

class Wheel {
    public void inflate(int psi) {}
}

class Window {
    public void rollup() {}
    public void rolldown() {}
}

class Door {
    public Window window = new Window();
    public void open() {}
    public void close() {}
}

public class Car {
    public Engine engine = new Engine();
    public Wheel[] wheel = new Wheel[4];
    public Door
    left = new Door(),
        right = new Door(); // 2-door
    public Car() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            wheel[i] = new Wheel();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.left.window.rollup();
        car.wheel[0].inflate(72);
    }
}///:~
```
Because in this case the composition of a car is part of the analysis of the problem (and not
simply part of the underlying design), making the members public assists the client
programmer's understanding of how to use the class and requires less code complexity for
the creator of the class. However, keep in mind that this is a special case, and that in general
you should make fields private.

When you inherit, you take an existing class and make a special version of it. In general, this
means that you're taking a general-purpose class and specializing it for a particular need.
With a little thought, you'll see that it would make no sense to compose a car using a vehicle
object‚Äîa car doesn't contain a vehicle, it is a vehicle. The is-a relationship is expressed with
inheritance, and the has-a relationship is expressed with composition.

Exercise 14: (1) In Car.java add a service( ) method to Engine and call this method
in main( ).

## üçÄ09.06 protected
Now that you've been introduced to inheritance, the keyword protected finally has
meaning. In an ideal world, the private keyword would be enough. In real projects, there are
times when you want to make something hidden from the world at large and yet allow access
for members of derived classes.

The protected keyword is a nod to pragmatism. It says ‚ÄúThis is private as far as the class
user is concerned, but available to anyone who inherits from this class or anyone else in the
same package.‚Äù (In Java, protected also provides package access.)

Although it's possible to create protected fields, the best approach is to leave the fields
private; you should always preserve your right to change the underlying implementation.

You can then allow controlled access to inheritors of your class through protected methods:

```java
//: reusing/Orc.java
// The protected keyword.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Villain {
    private String name;
    protected void set(String nm) { name = nm; }
    public Villain(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String toString() {
        return "I'm a Villain and my name is " + name;
    }
}

public class Orc extends Villain {
    private int orcNumber;
    public Orc(String name, int orcNumber) {
        super(name);
        this.orcNumber = orcNumber;
    }
    public void change(String name, int orcNumber) {
        set(name); // Available because it's protected
        this.orcNumber = orcNumber;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "Orc " + orcNumber + ": " + super.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Orc orc = new Orc("Limburger", 12);
        print(orc);
        orc.change("Bob", 19);
        print(orc);
    }
} /* Output:
Orc 12: I'm a Villain and my name is Limburger
Orc 19: I'm a Villain and my name is Bob
*///:~
```
You can see that change( ) has access to set( ) because it's protected. Also note the way
that Orc's toString( ) method is defined in terms of the base-class version of toString( ).
Exercise 15: (2) Create a class inside a package. Your class should contain a protected
method. Outside of the package, try to call the protected method and explain the results.
Now inherit from your class and call the protected method from inside a method of your
derived class.

## üçÄ09.07 Upcasting
The most important aspect of inheritance is not that it provides methods for the new class.
It's the relationship expressed between the new class and the base class. This relationship can
be summarized by saying, ‚ÄúThe new class is a type of the existing class.‚Äù

This description is not just a fanciful way of explaining inheritance‚Äîit's supported directly by
the language. As an example, consider a base class called Instrument that represents
musical instruments, and a derived class called Wind. Because inheritance means that all of
the methods in the base class are also available in the derived class, any message you can
send to the base class can also be sent to the derived class. If the Instrument class has a
play( ) method, so will Wind instruments. This means we can accurately say that a Wind
object is also a type of Instrument. The following example shows how the compiler
supports this notion:

```java
//: reusing/Wind.java
// Inheritance & upcasting.

class Instrument {
    public void play() {}
    static void tune(Instrument i) {
        // ...
        i.play();
    }
}

// Wind objects are instruments
// because they have the same interface:
public class Wind extends Instrument {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wind flute = new Wind();
        Instrument.tune(flute); // Upcasting
    }
} ///:~
```
What's interesting in this example is the tune( ) method, which accepts an Instrument
reference. However, in Wind.main( ) the tune( ) method is called by giving it a Wind
reference. Given that Java is particular about type checking, it seems strange that a method
that accepts one type will readily accept another type, until you realize that a Wind object is
also an Instrument object, and there's no method that tune( ) could call for an
Instrument that isn't also in Wind. Inside tune( ), the code works for Instrument and
anything derived from Instrument, and the act of converting a Wind reference into an
Instrument reference is called upcasting.

### ‚òò Why ‚Äúupcasting‚Äù?
The term is based on the way that class inheritance diagrams have traditionally been drawn:
with the root at the top of the page, growing downward. (Of course, you can draw your
diagrams any way you find helpful.) The inheritance diagram for Wind.java is then:

Casting from a derived type to a base type moves up on the inheritance diagram, so it's
commonly referred to as upcasting. Upcasting is always safe because you're going from a
more specific type to a more general type. That is, the derived class is a superset of the base
class. It might contain more methods than the base class, but it must contain at least the
methods in the base class. The only thing that can occur to the class interface during the
upcast is that it can lose methods, not gain them. This is why the compiler allows upcasting
without any explicit casts or other special notation.

You can also perform the reverse of upcasting, called downcasting, but this involves a
dilemma that will be examined further in the next chapter, and in the Type Information
chapter.

### ‚òò Composition vs. inheritance revisited
In object-oriented programming, the most likely way that you'll create and use code is by
simply packaging data and methods together into a class, and using objects of that class.
You'll also use existing classes to build new classes with composition. Less frequently, you'll
use inheritance. So although inheritance gets a lot of emphasis while learning OOP, it doesn't
mean that you should use it everywhere you possibly can. On the contrary, you should use it
sparingly, only when it's clear that inheritance is useful. One of the clearest ways to
determine whether you should use composition or inheritance is to ask whether you'll ever
need to upcast from your new class to the base class. If you must upcast, then inheritance is
necessary, but if you don't need to upcast, then you should look closely at whether you need
inheritance. The Polymorphism chapter provides one of the most compelling reasons for
upcasting, but if you remember to ask ‚ÄúDo I need to upcast?‚Äù you'll have a good tool for
deciding between composition and inheritance.

Exercise 16: (2) Create a class called Amphibian. From this, inherit a class called
Frog. Put appropriate methods in the base class. In main( ), create a Frog and upcast it to
Amphibian and demonstrate that all the methods still work.

Exercise 17: (1) Modify Exercise 16 so that Frog overrides the method definitions from
the base class (provides new definitions using the same method signatures). Note what
happens in main( ).

## üçÄ09.08 The final keyword
Java's final keyword has slightly different meanings depending on the context, but in
general it says ‚ÄúThis cannot be changed.‚Äù You might want to prevent changes for two reasons:
design or efficiency. Because these two reasons are quite different, it's possible to misuse the
final keyword.

The following sections discuss the three places where final can be used: for data, methods,
and classes.

### ‚òò final data
Many programming languages have a way to tell the compiler that a piece of data is
‚Äúconstant.‚Äù A constant is useful for two reasons:
1. It can be a compile-time constant that won't ever change.

2. It can be a value initialized at run time that you don't want changed.

In the case of a compile-time constant, the compiler is allowed to ‚Äúfold‚Äù the constant value
into any calculations in which it's used; that is, the calculation can be performed at compile
time, eliminating some run-time overhead. In Java, these sorts of constants must be
primitives and are expressed with the final keyword. A value must be given at the time of
definition of such a constant.

A field that is both static and final has only one piece of storage that cannot be changed.
When final is used with object references rather than primitives, the meaning can be
confusing. With a primitive, final makes the value a constant, but with an object reference,
final makes the reference a constant. Once the reference is initialized to an object, it can
never be changed to point to another object. However, the object itself can be modified; Java
does not provide a way to make any arbitrary object a constant. (You can, however, write
your class so that objects have the effect of being constant.) This restriction includes arrays,
which are also objects.

Here's an example that demonstrates final fields. Note that by convention, fields that are
both static and final (that is, compile-time constants) are capitalized and use underscores
to separate words.

```java
//: reusing/FinalData.java
// The effect of final on fields.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Value {
    int i; // Package access
    public Value(int i) { this.i = i; }
}

public class FinalData {
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    private String id;
    public FinalData(String id) { this.id = id; }
    // Can be compile-time constants:
    private final int valueOne = 9;
    private static final int VALUE_TWO = 99;
    // Typical public constant:
    public static final int VALUE_THREE = 39;
    // Cannot be compile-time constants:
    private final int i4 = rand.nextInt(20);
    static final int INT_5 = rand.nextInt(20);
    private Value v1 = new Value(11);
    private final Value v2 = new Value(22);
    private static final Value VAL_3 = new Value(33);
    // Arrays:
    private final int[] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
    public String toString() {
        return id + ": " + "i4 = " + i4 + ", INT_5 = " + INT_5;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalData fd1 = new FinalData("fd1");
        //! fd1.valueOne++; // Error: can't change value
        fd1.v2.i++; // Object isn't constant!
        fd1.v1 = new Value(9); // OK -- not final
        for (int i = 0; i < fd1.a.length; i++)
            fd1.a[i]++; // Object isn't constant!
        //! fd1.v2 = new Value(0); // Error: Can't
        //! fd1.VAL_3 = new Value(1); // change reference
        //! fd1.a = new int[3];
        print(fd1);
        print("Creating new FinalData");
        FinalData fd2 = new FinalData("fd2");
        print(fd1);
        print(fd2);
    }
}/* Output:
fd1: i4 = 15, INT_5 = 18
Creating new FinalData
fd1: i4 = 15, INT_5 = 18
fd2: i4 = 13, INT_5 = 18
*///:~
```
Since valueOne and VALUE_TWO are final primitives with compile-time values, they
can both be used as compile-time constants and are not different in any important way.

VALUE_THREE is the more typical way you'll see such constants defined: public so
they're usable outside the package, static to emphasize that there's only one, and final to
say that it's a constant. Note that final static primitives with constant initial values (that is,
compile-time constants) are named with all capitals by convention, with words separated by
underscores. (This is just like C constants, which is where the convention originated.)
Just because something is final doesn't mean that its value is known at compile time. This is
demonstrated by initializing i4 and INT_5 at run time using randomly generated numbers.

This portion of the example also shows the difference between making a final value static or
non-static. This difference shows up only when the values are initialized at run time, since
the compile-time values are treated the same by the compiler. (And presumably optimized
out of existence.) The difference is shown when you run the program. Note that the values of
i4 for fd1 and fd2 are unique, but the value for INT_5 is not changed by creating the second
FinalData object. That's because it's static and is initialized once upon loading and not
each time a new object is created.

The variables v1 through VAL_3 demonstrate the meaning of a final reference. As you can
see in main( ), just because v2 is final doesn't mean that you can't change its value.
Because it's a reference, final means that you cannot rebind v2 to a new object. You can also
see that the same meaning holds true for an array, which is just another kind of reference.
(There is no way that I know of to make the array references themselves final.) Making
references final seems less useful than making primitives final.

Exercise 18: (2) Create a class with a static final field and a final field and
demonstrate the difference between the two.

#### Blank finals
Java allows the creation of blank finals, which are fields that are declared as final but are not
given an initialization value. In all cases, the blank final must be initialized before it is used,
and the compiler ensures this. However, blank finals provide much more flexibility in the use
of the final keyword since, for example, a final field inside a class can now be different for
each object, and yet it retains its immutable quality. Here's an example:

```java
//: reusing/BlankFinal.java
// "Blank" final fields.

class Poppet {
    private int i;
    Poppet(int ii) { i = ii; }
}

public class BlankFinal {
    private final int i = 0; // Initialized final
    private final int j; // Blank final
    private final Poppet p; // Blank final reference
    // Blank finals MUST be initialized in the constructor:
    public BlankFinal() {
        j = 1; // Initialize blank final
        p = new Poppet(1); // Initialize blank final reference
    }
    public BlankFinal(int x) {
        j = x; // Initialize blank final
        p = new Poppet(x); // Initialize blank final reference
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new BlankFinal();
        new BlankFinal(47);
    }
}///:~
```
You're forced to perform assignments to finals either with an expression at the point of
definition of the field or in every constructor. That way it's guaranteed that the final field is
always initialized before use.

Exercise 19: (2) Create a class with a blank final reference to an object. Perform the
initialization of the blank final inside all constructors. Demonstrate the guarantee that the
final must be initialized before use, and that it cannot be changed once initialized.

#### final arguments
Java allows you to make arguments final by declaring them as such in the argument list.
This means that inside the method you cannot change what the argument reference points
to:

```java
//: reusing/FinalArguments.java
// Using "final" with method arguments.

class Gizmo {
    public void spin() {}
}

public class FinalArguments {
    void with(final Gizmo g) {
        //! g = new Gizmo(); // Illegal -- g is final
    }
    void without(Gizmo g) {
        g = new Gizmo(); // OK -- g not final
        g.spin();
    }
    // void f(final int i) { i++; } // Can't change
    // You can only read from a final primitive:
    int g(final int i) { return i + 1; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalArguments bf = new FinalArguments();
        bf.without(null);
        bf.with(null);
    }
} ///:~
```
The methods f( ) and g( ) show what happens when primitive arguments are final: You can
read the argument, but you can't change it. This feature is primarily used to pass data to
anonymous inner classes, which you'll learn about in the Inner Classes chapter.

### ‚òò final methods (Inline calls)
There are two reasons for final methods. The first is to put a ‚Äúlock‚Äù on the method to 
prevent any inheriting class from changing its meaning. This is done for design reasons when 
you want to make sure that a method's behavior is retained during inheritance and cannot be
overridden.

The second reason for final methods is efficiency. In earlier implementations of Java, if you
made a method final, you allowed the compiler to turn any calls to that method into inline
calls. When the compiler saw a final method call, it could (at its discretion) skip the normal
approach of inserting code to perform the method call mechanism (push arguments on the
stack, hop over to the method code and execute it, hop back and clean off the stack
arguments, and deal with the return value) and instead replace the method call with a copy of
the actual code in the method body. This eliminated the overhead of the method call. Of
course, if a method is big, then your code begins to bloat, and you probably wouldn't see any
performance gains from inlining, since any improvements will be dwarfed by the amount of
time spent inside the method.

In more recent version of Java, the virtual machine (in particular, the hotspot technologies)
can detect these situations and optimize away the extra indirection, so its no longer
necessary-in fact, it is now generally discouraged-to use final to try to help the optimizer.
With Java SE5/6, you should let the compiler and JVM handle efficiency issues and make a
method final only if you want to explicitly prevent overriding.¬π

¬π Don't fall prey to the urge to prematurely optimize. If you get your system working and 
it's too slow, it's doubtful that you can fix it with the final keyword. 
http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava has information about profiling, which can be
helpful in speeding up your program.

#### final and private
Any private methods in a class are implicitly final. Because you can't access a private
method, you can't override it. You can add the final specifier to a private method, but it
doesn't give that method any extra meaning.

This issue can cause confusion, because if you try to override a private method (which is
implicitly final), it seems to work, and the compiler doesn't give an error message:

```java
//: reusing/FinalOverridingIllusion.java
// It only looks like you can override
// a private or private final method.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class WithFinals {
    // Identical to "private" alone:
    private final void f() { print("WithFinals.f()"); }
    // Also automatically "final":
    private void g() { print("WithFinals.g()"); }
}

class OverridingPrivate extends WithFinals {
    private final void f() {
        print("OverridingPrivate.f()");
    }
    private void g() {
        print("OverridingPrivate.g()");
    }
}

class OverridingPrivate2 extends OverridingPrivate {
    public final void f() {
        print("OverridingPrivate2.f()");
    }
    public void g() {
        print("OverridingPrivate2.g()");
    }
}

public class FinalOverridingIllusion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OverridingPrivate2 op2 = new OverridingPrivate2();
        op2.f();
        op2.g();
        // You can upcast:
        OverridingPrivate op = op2;
        // But you can't call the methods:
        //! op.f();
        //! op.g();
        // Same here:
        WithFinals wf = op2;
        //! wf.f();
        //! wf.g();
    }
}/* Output:
OverridingPrivate2.f()
OverridingPrivate2.g()
*///:~
```
‚ÄúOverriding‚Äù can only occur if something is part of the base-class interface. That is, you must
be able to upcast an object to its base type and call the same method (the point of this will
become clear in the next chapter). If a method is private, it isn't part of the base-class
interface. It is just some code that's hidden away inside the class, and it just happens to have
that name, but if you create a public, protected, or package-access method with the same
name in the derived class, there's no connection to the method that might happen to have
that name in the base class. You haven't overridden the method; you've just created a new
method. Since a private method is unreachable and effectively invisible, it doesn't factor
into anything except for the code organization of the class for which it was defined.

Exercise 20: (1) Show that @Override annotation solves the problem in this section.

Exercise 21: (1) Create a class with a final method. Inherit from that class and attempt
to overwrite that method.

### ‚òò final classes
When you say that an entire class is final (by preceding its definition with the final
keyword), you state that you don't want to inherit from this class or allow anyone else to do
so. In other words, for some reason the design of your class is such that there is never a need
to make any changes, or for safety or security reasons you don't want subclassing.

```java
//: reusing/Jurassic.java
// Making an entire class final.

class SmallBrain {}

final class Dinosaur {
    int i = 7;
    int j = 1;
    SmallBrain x = new SmallBrain();
    void f() {}
}

//! class Further extends Dinosaur {}
// error: Cannot extend final class 'Dinosaur'

public class Jurassic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dinosaur n = new Dinosaur();
        n.f();
        n.i = 40;
        n.j++;
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that the fields of a final class can be final or not, as you choose. The same rules apply
to final for fields regardless of whether the class is defined as final. However, because it
prevents inheritance, all methods in a final class are implicitly final, since there's no way to
override them. You can add the final specifier to a method in a final class, but it doesn't add
any meaning.

Exercise 22: (1) Create a final class and attempt to inherit from it.

### ‚òò final caution
It can seem to be sensible to make a method final while you're designing a class. You might
feel that no one could possibly want to override your methods. Sometimes this is true.
But be careful with your assumptions. In general, it's difficult to anticipate how a class can be
reused, especially a general-purpose class. If you define a method as final, you might prevent
the possibility of reusing your class through inheritance in some other programmer's project
simply because you couldn't imagine it being used that way.

The standard Java library is a good example of this. In particular, the Java 1.0/1.1 Vector
class was commonly used and might have been even more useful if, in the name of efficiency
(which was almost certainly an illusion), all the methods hadn't been made final. It's easily
conceivable that you might want to inherit and override with such a fundamentally useful
class, but the designers somehow decided this wasn't appropriate. This is ironic for two
reasons. First, Stack is inherited from Vector, which says that a Stack is a Vector, which
isn't really true from a logical standpoint. Nonetheless, it's a case where the Java designers
themselves inherited Vector. At the point they created Stack this way, they should have
realized that final methods were too restrictive.

Second, many of the most important methods of Vector, such as addElement( ) and
elementAt( ), are synchronized. As you will see in the Concurrency chapter, this imposes
a significant performance overhead that probably wipes out any gains provided by final. This
lends credence to the theory that programmers are consistently bad at guessing where
optimizations should occur. It's just too bad that such a clumsy design made it into the
standard library, where everyone had to cope with it. (Fortunately, the modern Java
container library replaces Vector with ArrayList, which behaves much more civilly.

Unfortunately, there's still new code being written that uses the old container library.)
It's also interesting to note that Hashtable, another important Java 1.0/1.1 standard library
class, does not have any final methods. As mentioned elsewhere in this book, it's quite
obvious that some classes were designed by completely different people than others. (You'll
see that the method names in Hashtable are much briefer compared to those in Vector,
another piece of evidence.) This is precisely the sort of thing that should not be obvious to
consumers of a class library. When things are inconsistent, it just makes more work for the
user‚Äîyet another paean to the value of design and code walkthroughs. (Note that the modern
Java container library replaces Hashtable with HashMap.)

## üçÄ09.09 Initialization and class loading
In more traditional languages, programs are loaded all at once as part of the startup process.
This is followed by initialization, and then the program begins. The process of initialization in
these languages must be carefully controlled so that the order of initialization of statics
doesn't cause trouble. C++, for example, has problems if one static expects another static to
be valid before the second one has been initialized.

Java doesn't have this problem because it takes a different approach to loading. This is one of
the activities that become easier, because everything in Java is an object. Remember that the
compiled code for each class exists in its own separate file. That file isn't loaded until the
code is needed. In general, you can say that ‚Äúclass code is loaded at the point of first use.‚Äù
This is usually when the first object of that class is constructed, but loading also occurs when
a static field or static method is accessed. ¬≤

¬≤ The constructor is also a static method even though the static keyword is not explicit. So to 
be precise, a class is first loaded when any one of its static members is accessed.

The point of first use is also where the static initialization takes place. All the static objects
and the static code block will be initialized in textual order (that is, the order that you write
them down in the class definition) at the point of loading. The statics, of course, are
initialized only once.

### ‚òò Initialization with inheritance
It's helpful to look at the whole initialization process, including inheritance, to get a full
picture of what happens. Consider the following example:

```java
//: reusing/Beetle.java
// The full process of initialization.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Insect {
    private int i = 9;
    protected int j;
    Insect() {
        print("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
        j = 39;
    }
    private static int x1 =
        printInit("static Insect.x1 initialized");

    static int printInit(String s) {
        print(s);
        return 47;
    }
}

public class Beetle extends Insect {
    private int k = printInit("Beetle.k initialized");
    public Beetle() {
        print("k = " + k);
        print("j = " + j);
    }
    private static int x2 =
        printInit("static Beetle.x2 initialized");
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Beetle constructor");
        Beetle b = new Beetle();
    }
} /* Output:
static Insect.x1 initialized
static Beetle.x2 initialized
Beetle constructor
i = 9, j = 0
Beetle.k initialized
k = 47
j = 39
*///:~
```
The first thing that happens when you run Java on Beetle is that you try to access
Beetle.main( ) (a static method), so the loader goes out and finds the compiled code for
the Beetle class (this happens to be in a file called Beetle.class). In the process of loading
it, the loader notices that it has a base class (that's what the extends keyword says), which it
then loads. This will happen whether or not you're going to make an object of that base class.
(Try commenting out the object creation to prove it to yourself.)

If the base class has a base class, that second base class would then be loaded, and so on.
Next, the static initialization in the root base class (in this case, Insect) is performed, and
then the next derived class, and so on. This is important because the derived-class static
initialization might depend on the base class member being initialized properly.

At this point, the necessary classes have all been loaded so the object can be created. First, all
the primitives in this object are set to their default values and the object references are set to
null‚Äîthis happens in one fell swoop by setting the memory in the object to binary zero. Then
the base-class constructor will be called. In this case the call is automatic, but you can also
specify the base-class constructor call (as the first operation in the Beetle( ) constructor) by
using super. The base class construction goes through the same process in the same order as
the derived-class constructor. After the base-class constructor completes, the instance
variables are initialized in textual order. Finally, the rest of the body of the constructor is
executed.

Exercise 23: (2) Prove that class loading takes place only once. Prove that loading may
be caused by either the creation of the first instance of that class or by the access of a static
member.

Exercise 24: (2) In Beetle.java, inherit a specific type of beetle from class Beetle,
following the same format as the existing classes. Trace and explain the output.

## üçÄ09.10 Summary
Both inheritance and composition allow you to create a new type from existing types.
Composition reuses existing types as part of the underlying implementation of the new type,
and inheritance reuses the interface.

With Inheritance, the derived class has the base-class interface, so it can be upcast to the
base, which is critical for polymorphism, as you'll see in the next chapter.

Despite the strong emphasis on inheritance in object-oriented programming, when you start
a design you should generally prefer composition (or possibly delegation) during the first cut
and use inheritance only when it is clearly necessary. Composition tends to be more flexible.
In addition, by using the added artifice of inheritance with your member type, you can
change the exact type, and thus the behavior, of those member objects at run time. Therefore,
you can change the behavior of the composed object at run time.

When designing a system, your goal is to find or create a set of classes in which each class has
a specific use and is neither too big (encompassing so much functionality that it's unwieldy to
reuse) nor annoyingly small (you can't use it by itself or without adding functionality). If your
designs become too complex, it's often helpful to add more objects by breaking down existing
ones into smaller parts.

When you set out to design a system, it's important to realize that program development is an
incremental process, just like human learning. It relies on experimentation; you can do as
much analysis as you want, but you still won't know all the answers when you set out on a
project. You'll have much more success-and more immediate feedback-if you start out to
‚Äúgrow‚Äù your project as an organic, evolutionary creature, rather than constructing it all at
once like a glass-box skyscraper. Inheritance and composition are two of the most
fundamental tools in object-oriented programming that allow you to perform such experiments.

# üìú 10. Polymorphism
‚ÄúI have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the
machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am
not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that
could provoke such a question.‚Äù Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
Polymorphism is the third essential feature of an object-oriented
programming language, after data abstraction and inheritance.

It provides another dimension of separation of interface from implementation, to decouple
what from how. Polymorphism allows improved code organization and readability as well as
the creation of extensible programs that can be ‚Äúgrown‚Äù not only during the original creation
of the project, but also when new features are desired.

Encapsulation creates new data types by combining characteristics and behaviors.
Implementation hiding separates the interface from the implementation by making the
details private. This sort of mechanical organization makes ready sense to someone with a
procedural programming background. But polymorphism deals with decoupling in terms of
types. In the last chapter, you saw how inheritance allows the treatment of an object as its
own type or its base type. This ability is critical because it allows many types (derived from
the same base type) to be treated as if they were one type, and a single piece of code to work
on all those different types equally. The polymorphic method call allows one type to express
its distinction from another, similar type, as long as they're both derived from the same base
type. This distinction is expressed through differences in behavior of the methods that you
can call through the base class.

In this chapter, you'll learn about polymorphism (also called dynamic binding or late
binding or run-time binding) starting from the basics, with simple examples that strip away
everything but the polymorphic behavior of the program.

## üçÄ10.01 Upcasting revisited
In the last chapter you saw how an object can be used as its own type or as an object of its
base type. Taking an object reference and treating it as a reference to its base type is called
upcasting because of the way inheritance trees are drawn with the base class at the top.
You also saw a problem arise, which is embodied in the following example about musical
instruments.

First, since several examples play Notes, we should create a separate Note enumeration, in a
package:

```java
//: polymorphism/music/Note.java
// Notes to play on musical instruments.
package polymorphism.music;

public enum Note {
    MIDDLE_C,
    C_SHARP,
    B_FLAT; // Etc.
} ///:~
```
enums were introduced in the Initialization & Cleanup chapter.

Here, `Wind` is a type of `Instrument`; therefore, `Wind` is inherited from `Instrument`:

```java
//: polymorphism/music/Instrument.java
package polymorphism.music;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Instrument.play()");
    }
}
///:~

//: polymorphism/music/Wind.java
package polymorphism.music;

// Wind objects are instruments
// because they have the same interface:
public class Wind extends Instrument {
    // Redefine interface method:
    public void play(Note n) {
        System.out.println("Wind.play() " + n);
    }
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/music/Music.java
// Inheritance & upcasting.
package polymorphism.music;

public class Music {
    public static void tune(Instrument i) {
        // ...
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wind flute = new Wind();
        tune(flute); // Upcasting
    }
} /* Output:
Wind.play() MIDDLE_C
*///:~
```
The method Music.tune( ) accepts an Instrument reference, but also anything derived
from Instrument. In main( ), you can see this happening as a Wind reference is passed to
tune( ), with no cast necessary. This is acceptable‚Äîthe interface in Instrument must exist
in Wind, because Wind is inherited from Instrument. Upcasting from Wind to Instrument 
may ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù that interface, but it cannot make it anything less than the full
interface to Instrument.

### ‚òò Forgetting the object type
Music.java might seem strange to you. Why should anyone intentionally forget the type of
an object? This is what happens when you upcast, and it seems like it could be much more
straightforward if tune( ) simply takes a Wind reference as its argument. This brings up an
essential point: If you did that, you'd need to write a new tune( ) for every type of
Instrument in your system. Suppose we follow this reasoning and add Stringed and
Brass instruments:

```java
//: polymorphism/music/Music2.java
// Overloading instead of upcasting.
package polymorphism.music;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Stringed extends Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Stringed.play() " + n);
    }
}

class Brass extends Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Brass.play() " + n);
    }
}

public class Music2 {
    public static void tune(Wind i) {
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    public static void tune(Stringed i) {
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    public static void tune(Brass i) {
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wind flute = new Wind();
        Stringed violin = new Stringed();
        Brass frenchHorn = new Brass();
        tune(flute); // No upcasting
        tune(violin);
        tune(frenchHorn);
    }
} /* Output:
Wind.play() MIDDLE_C
Stringed.play() MIDDLE_C
Brass.play() MIDDLE_C
*///:~
```
This works, but there's a major drawback: you must write type-specific methods for each new
Instrument class you add. This means more programming in the first place, but it also
means that if you want to add a new method like tune( ) or a new type of Instrument,
you've got a lot of work to do. Add the fact that the compiler won't give you any error
messages if you forget to overload one of your methods and the whole process of working
with types becomes unmanageable.

Wouldn't it be much nicer if you could just write a single method that takes the base class as
its argument, and not any of the specific derived classes? That is, wouldn't it be nice if you
could forget that there are derived classes, and write your code to talk only to the base class?
That's exactly what polymorphism allows you to do. However, most programmers who come
from a procedural programming background have a bit of trouble with the way
polymorphism works.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a Cycle class, with subclasses Unicycle, Bicycle and Tricycle.
Demonstrate that an instance of each type can be upcast to Cycle via a ride( ) method.

## üçÄ10.02 The twist
The difficulty with Music.java can be seen by running the program. The output is
Wind.play( ). This is clearly the desired output, but it doesn't seem to make sense that it
would work that way. Look at the tune( ) method:
```java
public static void tune(Instrument i) {
    // ...
    i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
}
```
It receives an Instrument reference. So how can the compiler possibly know that this
Instrument reference points to a Wind in this case and not a Brass or Stringed? The
compiler can't. To get a deeper understanding of the issue, it's helpful to examine the 
subject of binding.

### ‚òò Method-call binding
Connecting a method call to a method body is called binding. When binding is performed
before the program is run (by the compiler and linker, if there is one), it's called early
binding. You might not have heard the term before because it has never been an option with
procedural languages. C compilers have only one kind of method call, and that's early
binding.

The confusing part of the preceding program revolves around early binding, because the
compiler cannot know the correct method to call when it has only an Instrument reference.
The solution is called late binding, which means that the binding occurs at run time, based
on the type of object. Late binding is also called dynamic binding or runtime binding. When
a language implements late binding, there must be some mechanism to determine the type of
the object at run time and to call the appropriate method. That is, the compiler still doesn't
know the object type, but the method-call mechanism finds out and calls the correct method
body. The late-binding mechanism varies from language to language, but you can imagine
that some sort of type information must be installed in the objects.

All method binding in Java uses late binding unless the method is `static` or `final`
(private methods are implicitly final). This means that ordinarily you don't need to make any
decisions about whether late binding will occur‚Äîit happens automatically.

Why would you declare a method final? As noted in the last chapter, it prevents anyone from
overriding that method. Perhaps more important, it effectively ‚Äúturns off‚Äù dynamic binding,
or rather it tells the compiler that dynamic binding isn't necessary. This allows the compiler
to generate slightly more efficient code for final method calls. However, in most cases it
won't make any overall performance difference in your program, so it's best to only use final
as a design decision, and not as an attempt to improve performance.

### ‚òò Producing the right behavior
Once you know that all method binding in Java happens polymorphically via late binding,
you can write your code to talk to the base class and know that all the derived-class cases will
work correctly using the same code. Or to put it another way, you ‚Äúsend a message to an
object and let the object figure out the right thing to do.‚Äù

The classic example in OOP is the ‚Äúshape‚Äù example. This is commonly used because it is easy
to visualize, but unfortunately it can confuse novice programmers into thinking that OOP is
just for graphics programming, which is of course not the case.

The shape example has a base class called Shape and various derived types: Circle,
Square, Triangle, etc. The reason the example works so well is that it's easy to say ‚Äúa circle
is a type of shape‚Äù and be understood. The inheritance diagram shows the relationships:

The upcast could occur in a statement as simple as:

    Shape s = new Circle();

Here, a Circle object is created, and the resulting reference is immediately assigned to a
Shape, which would seem to be an error (assigning one type to another); and yet it's fine
because a Circle is a Shape by inheritance. So the compiler agrees with the statement and
doesn't issue an error message.

Suppose you call one of the base-class methods (that have been overridden in the derived
classes):

    s.draw();

Again, you might expect that Shape's draw( ) is called because this is, after all, a Shape
reference‚Äîso how could the compiler know to do anything else? And yet the proper
Circle.draw( ) is called because of late binding (polymorphism).

The following example puts it a slightly different way. First, let's create a reusable 
library of Shape types:

```java
//: polymorphism/shape/Shape.java
package polymorphism.shape;

public class Shape {
    public void draw() {}
    public void erase() {}
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/shape/Circle.java
package polymorphism.shape;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public void draw() { print("Circle.draw()"); }
    public void erase() { print("Circle.erase()"); }
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/shape/Square.java
package polymorphism.shape;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Square extends Shape {
    public void draw() { print("Square.draw()"); }
    public void erase() { print("Square.erase()"); }
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/shape/Triangle.java
package polymorphism.shape;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Triangle extends Shape {
    public void draw() { print("Triangle.draw()"); }
    public void erase() { print("Triangle.erase()"); }
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/shape/RandomShapeGenerator.java
// A "factory" that randomly creates shapes.
package polymorphism.shape;
import java.util.*;

public class RandomShapeGenerator {
    private Random rand = new Random(47);
    public Shape next() {
        switch(rand.nextInt(3)) {
            default:
            case 0: return new Circle();
            case 1: return new Square();
            case 2: return new Triangle();
        }
    }
} ///:~

//: polymorphism/Shapes.java
// Polymorphism in Java.
import polymorphism.shape.*;

public class Shapes {
    private static RandomShapeGenerator gen = new RandomShapeGenerator();
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] s = new Shape[9];
        // Fill up the array with shapes:
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
            s[i] = gen.next();
        // Make polymorphic method calls:
        for(Shape shp : s)
            shp.draw();
    }
} /* Output:
Triangle.draw()
Triangle.draw()
Square.draw()
Triangle.draw()
Square.draw()
Triangle.draw()
Square.draw()
Triangle.draw()
Circle.draw()
*///:~
```
The base class Shape establishes the common interface to anything inherited from Shape‚Äî
that is, all shapes can be drawn and erased. The derived classes override these definitions to
provide unique behavior for each specific type of shape.

RandomShapeGenerator is a kind of ‚Äúfactory‚Äù that produces a reference to a randomly-
selected Shape object each time you call its next( ) method. Note that the upcasting
happens in the return statements, each of which takes a reference to a Circle, Square, or
Triangle and sends it out of next( ) as the return type, Shape. So whenever you call
next( ), you never get a chance to see what specific type it is, since you always get back a
plain Shape reference.

main( ) contains an array of Shape references filled through calls to
RandomShapeGenerator.next( ). At this point you know you have Shapes, but you
don't know anything more specific than that (and neither does the compiler). However, when
you step through this array and call draw( ) for each one, the correct type-specific behavior
magically occurs, as you can see from the output when you run the program.

The point of creating the shapes randomly is to drive home the understanding that the
compiler can have no special knowledge that allows it to make the correct calls at compile
time. All the calls to draw( ) must be made through dynamic binding.

Exercise 2: (1) Add the @Override annotation to the shapes example.

Exercise 3: (1) Add a new method in the base class of Shapes.java that prints a
message, but don't override it in the derived classes. Explain what happens. Now override it
in one of the derived classes but not the others, and see what happens. Finally, override it in
all the derived classes.

Exercise 4: (2) Add a new type of Shape to Shapes.java and verify in main( ) that
polymorphism works for your new type as it does in the old types.

Exercise 5: (1) Starting from Exercise 1, add a wheels( ) method in Cycle, which
returns the number of wheels. Modify ride( ) to call wheels( ) and verify that
polymorphism works.

### ‚òò Extensibility
Now let's return to the musical instrument example. Because of polymorphism, you can add
as many new types as you want to the system without changing the tune( ) method. In a
well-designed OOP program, most or all of your methods will follow the model of tune( )
and communicate only with the base-class interface. Such a program is extensible because
you can add new functionality by inheriting new data types from the common base class. The
methods that manipulate the base-class interface will not need to be changed at all to
accommodate the new classes.

Consider what happens if you take the instrument example and add more methods in the
base class and a number of new classes. Here's the diagram:

All these new classes work correctly with the old, unchanged tune( ) method. Even if
tune( ) is in a separate file and new methods are added to the interface of Instrument,
tune( ) will still work correctly, even without recompiling it. Here is the implementation of
the diagram:

```java
//: polymorphism/music3/Music3.java
// An extensible program.
package polymorphism.music3;
import polymorphism.music.Note;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Instrument {
    void play(Note n) { print("Instrument.play() " + n); }
    String what() { return "Instrument"; }
    void adjust() { print("Adjusting Instrument"); }
}

class Wind extends Instrument {
    void play(Note n) { print("Wind.play() " + n); }
    String what() { return "Wind"; }
    void adjust() { print("Adjusting Wind"); }
}

class Percussion extends Instrument {
    void play(Note n) { print("Percussion.play() " + n); }
    String what() { return "Percussion"; }
    void adjust() { print("Adjusting Percussion"); }
}

class Stringed extends Instrument {
    void play(Note n) { print("Stringed.play() " + n); }
    String what() { return "Stringed"; }
    void adjust() { print("Adjusting Stringed"); }
}

class Brass extends Wind {
    void play(Note n) { print("Brass.play() " + n); }
    void adjust() { print("Adjusting Brass"); }
}

class Woodwind extends Wind {
    void play(Note n) { print("Woodwind.play() " + n); }
    String what() { return "Woodwind"; }
}

public class Music3 {
    // Doesn't care about type, so new types
    // added to the system still work right:
    public static void tune(Instrument i) {
        // ...
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    public static void tuneAll(Instrument[] e) {
        for (Instrument i: e)
            tune(i);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Upcasting during addition to the array:
        Instrument[] orchestra = {
            new Wind(),
            new Percussion(),
            new Stringed(),
            new Brass(),
            new Woodwind()
        };
        tuneAll(orchestra);
    }
}/* Output:
Wind.play() MIDDLE_C
Percussion.play() MIDDLE_C
Stringed.play() MIDDLE_C
Brass.play() MIDDLE_C
Woodwind.play() MIDDLE_C
*///:~
```
The new methods are what( ), which returns a String reference with a description of the
class, and adjust( ), which provides some way to adjust each instrument.

In main( ), when you place something inside the orchestra array, you automatically upcast
to Instrument.

You can see that the tune( ) method is blissfully ignorant of all the code changes that have
happened around it, and yet it works correctly. This is exactly what polymorphism is
supposed to provide. Changes in your code don't cause damage to parts of the program that
should not be affected. Put another way, polymorphism is an important technique for the
programmer to ‚Äúseparate the things that change from the things that stay the same.‚Äù

Exercise 6: (1) Change Music3.java so that what( ) becomes the root Object method
toString( ). Try printing the Instrument objects using System.out.println( ) (without
any casting).

Exercise 7: (2) Add a new type of Instrument to Music3.java and verify that
polymorphism works for your new type.

Exercise 8: (2) Modify Music3.java so that it randomly creates Instrument objects
the way Shapes.java does.

Exercise 9: (3) Create an inheritance hierarchy of Rodent: Mouse, Gerbil, Hamster,
etc. In the base class, provide methods that are common to all Rodents, and override these
in the derived classes to perform different behaviors depending on the specific type of
Rodent. Create an array of Rodent, fill it with different specific types of Rodents, and call
your base-class methods to see what happens.

Exercise 10: (3) Create a base class with two methods. In the first method, call the
second method. Inherit a class and override the second method. Create an object of the
derived class, upcast it to the base type, and call the first method. Explain what happens.

### ‚òò Pitfall: ‚Äúoverriding‚Äù private methods

Here's something you might innocently try to do:

```java
//: polymorphism/PrivateOverride.java
// Trying to override a private method.
package polymorphism;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PrivateOverride {
    private void f() { print("private f()"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrivateOverride po = new Derived();
        po.f();
    }
}

class Derived extends PrivateOverride {
    public void f() { print("public f()"); }
} /* Output:
private f()
*///:~
```
You might reasonably expect the output to be ‚Äúpublic f( )‚Äù, but a private method is
automatically final, and is also hidden from the derived class. So Derived's f( ) in this case
is a brand new method; it's not even overloaded, since the base-class version of f( ) isn't
visible in Derived.

The result of this is that only non-private methods may be overridden, but you should watch
out for the appearance of overriding private methods, which generates no compiler
warnings, but doesn't do what you might expect. To be clear, you should use a different name
from a private base-class method in your derived class.

### ‚òò Pitfall: fields and static methods
Once you learn about polymorphism, you can begin to think that everything happens
polymorphically. However, only ordinary method calls can be polymorphic. For example, if
you access a field directly, that access will be resolved at compile time, as the following
example demonstrates: ¬π

¬π Thanks to Randy Nichols for asking this question.

```java
//: polymorphism/FieldAccess.java
// Direct field access is determined at compile time.
class Super {
    public int field = 0;
    public int getField() { return field; }
}

class Sub extends Super {
    public int field = 1;
    public int getField() { return field; }
    public int getSuperField() { return super.field; }
}

public class FieldAccess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Super sup = new Sub(); // Upcast
        System.out.println("sup.field = " + sup.field +
            ", sup.getField() = " + sup.getField());
        Sub sub = new Sub();
        System.out.println("sub.field = " +
            sub.field + ", sub.getField() = " +
            sub.getField() +
            ", sub.getSuperField() = " +
            sub.getSuperField());
    }
} /* Output:
sup.field = 0, sup.getField() = 1
sub.field = 1, sub.getField() = 1, sub.getSuperField() = 0
*///:~
```
When a Sub object is upcast to a Super reference, any field accesses are resolved by the
compiler, and are thus not polymorphic. In this example, different storage is allocated for
Super.field and Sub.field. Thus, Sub actually contains two fields called field: its own and
the one that it gets from Super. However, the Super version is not the default that is
produced when you refer to field in Sub; in order to get the Super field you must explicitly
say super.field.

Although this seems like it could be a confusing issue, in practice it virtually never comes up.
For one thing, you'll generally make all fields private and so you won't access them directly,
but only as side effects of calling methods. In addition, you probably won't give the same
name to a base-class field and a derived-class field, because its confusing.

If a method is static, it doesn't behave polymorphically:

```java
//: polymorphism/StaticPolymorphism.java
// Static methods are not polymorphic.

class StaticSuper {
    public static String staticGet() {
        return "Base staticGet()";
    }
    public String dynamicGet() {
        return "Base dynamicGet()";
    }
}

class StaticSub extends StaticSuper {
    public static String staticGet() {
        return "Derived staticGet()";
    }
    public String dynamicGet() {
        return "Derived dynamicGet()";
    }
}

public class StaticPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticSuper sup = new StaticSub(); // Upcast
        System.out.println(sup.staticGet());
        System.out.println(sup.dynamicGet());
    }
}/* Output:
Base staticGet()
Derived dynamicGet()
*///:~
```
static methods are associated with the class, and not the individual objects.

## üçÄ10.03 Constructors and polymorphism
As usual, constructors are different from other kinds of methods. This is also true when
polymorphism is involved. Even though constructors are not polymorphic (they're actually
static methods, but the static declaration is implicit), it's important to understand the way
constructors work in complex hierarchies and with polymorphism. This understanding will
help you avoid unpleasant entanglements.

### ‚òò Order of constructor calls
The order of constructor calls was briefly discussed in the Initialization & Cleanup chapter
and again in the Reusing Classes chapter, but that was before polymorphism was introduced.
A constructor for the base class is always called during the construction process for a derived
class, chaining up the inheritance hierarchy so that a constructor for every base class is
called. This makes sense because the constructor has a special job: to see that the object is
built properly. A derived class has access to its own members only, and not to those of the
base class (whose members are typically private). Only the base-class constructor has the
proper knowledge and access to initialize its own elements. Therefore, it's essential that all
constructors get called; otherwise the entire object wouldn't be constructed. That's why the
compiler enforces a constructor call for every portion of a derived class. It will silently call the
default constructor if you don't explicitly call a base-class constructor in the derived-class
constructor body. If there is no default constructor, the compiler will complain. (In the case
where a class has no constructors, the compiler will automatically synthesize a default
constructor.)

Let's take a look at an example that shows the effects of composition, inheritance, and
polymorphism on the order of construction:

```java
//: polymorphism/Sandwich.java
// Order of constructor calls.
package polymorphism;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Bread {
    Bread() { print("Bread()"); }
}

class Cheese {
    Cheese() { print("Cheese()"); }
}

class Lettuce {
    Lettuce() { print("Lettuce()"); }
}

class Meal {
    Meal() { print("Meal()"); }
}

class Lunch extends Meal {
    Lunch() { print("Lunch()"); }
}

class PortableLunch extends Lunch {
    PortableLunch() { print("PortableLunch()"); }
}

public class Sandwich extends PortableLunch {
    private Bread b = new Bread();
    private Cheese c = new Cheese();
    private Lettuce l = new Lettuce();
    public Sandwich() { print("Sandwich()"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Sandwich();
    }
} /* Output:
Meal()
Lunch()
PortableLunch()
Bread()
Cheese()
Lettuce()
Sandwich()
*///:~
```
This example creates a complex class out of other classes, and each class has a constructor
that announces itself. The important class is Sandwich, which reflects three levels of
inheritance (four, if you count the implicit inheritance from Object) and three member
objects. You can see the output when a Sandwich object is created in main( ). This means
that the order of constructor calls for a complex object is as follows:
1. The base-class constructor is called. This step is repeated recursively such that the
root of the hierarchy is constructed first, followed by the next-derived class, etc., until
the most-derived class is reached.

2. Member initializers are called in the order of declaration.

3. The body of the derived-class constructor is called.

The order of the constructor calls is important. When you inherit, you know all about the
base class and can access any public and protected members of the base class. This means
that you must be able to assume that all the members of the base class are valid when you're
in the derived class. In a normal method, construction has already taken place, so all the
members of all parts of the object have been built. Inside the constructor, however, you must
be able to assume that all members that you use have been built. The only way to guarantee
this is for the base-class constructor to be called first. Then when you're in the derived-class
constructor, all the members you can access in the base class have been initialized. Knowing
that all members are valid inside the constructor is also the reason that, whenever possible,
you should initialize all member objects (that is, objects placed in the class using
composition) at their point of definition in the class (e.g., b, c, and l in the preceding
example). If you follow this practice, you will help ensure that all base class members and
member objects of the current object have been initialized. Unfortunately, this doesn't handle
every case, as you will see in the next section.

Exercise 11: (1) Add class Pickle to Sandwich.java.

### ‚òò Inheritance and cleanup
When using composition and inheritance to create a new class, most of the time you won't
have to worry about cleaning up; subobjects can usually be left to the garbage collector. If you
do have cleanup issues, you must be diligent and create a dispose( ) method (the name I
have chosen to use here; you may come up with something better) for your new class. And
with inheritance, you must override dispose( ) in the derived class if you have any special
cleanup that must happen as part of garbage collection. When you override dispose( ) in an
inherited class, it's important to remember to call the base-class version of dispose( ), since
otherwise the base-class cleanup will not happen. The following example demonstrates this:

```java
//: polymorphism/Frog.java
// Cleanup and inheritance.
package polymorphism;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Characteristic {
    private String s;
    Characteristic(String s) {
        this.s = s;
        print("Creating Characteristic " + s);
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("disposing Characteristic " + s);
    }
}

class Description {
    private String s;
    Description(String s) {
        this.s = s;
        print("Creating Description " + s);
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("disposing Description " + s);
    }
}

class LivingCreature {
    private Characteristic p =
        new Characteristic("is alive");
    private Description t =
        new Description("Basic Living Creature");
    LivingCreature() {
        print("LivingCreature()");
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("LivingCreature dispose");
        t.dispose();
        p.dispose();
    }
}

class Animal extends LivingCreature {
    private Characteristic p =
        new Characteristic("has heart");
    private Description t =
        new Description("Animal not Vegetable");
    Animal() { print("Animal()"); }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("Animal dispose");
        t.dispose();
        p.dispose();
        super.dispose();
    }
}

class Amphibian extends Animal {
    private Characteristic p =
        new Characteristic("can live in water");
    private Description t =
        new Description("Both water and land");
    Amphibian() {
        print("Amphibian()");
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("Amphibian dispose");
        t.dispose();
        p.dispose();
        super.dispose();
    }
}

public class Frog extends Amphibian {
    private Characteristic p = new Characteristic("Croaks");
    private Description t = new Description("Eats Bugs");
    public Frog() { print("Frog()"); }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("Frog dispose");
        t.dispose();
        p.dispose();
        super.dispose();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frog frog = new Frog();
        print("Bye!");
        frog.dispose();
    }
}/* Output:
Creating Characteristic is alive

*///:~
```
Each class in the hierarchy also contains a member objects of types Characteristic and
Description, which must also be disposed. The order of disposal should be the reverse of
the order of initialization, in case one subobject is dependent on another. For fields, this
means the reverse of the order of declaration (since fields are initialized in declaration
order). For base classes (following the form that's used in C++ for destructors), you should
perform the derived-class cleanup first, then the base-class cleanup. That's because the
derived-class cleanup could call some methods in the base class that require the base-class
components to be alive, so you must not destroy them prematurely. From the output you can
see that all parts of the Frog object are disposed in reverse order of creation.
From this example, you can see that although you don't always need to perform cleanup,
when you do, the process requires care and awareness.

Exercise 12: (3) Modify Exercise 9 so that it demonstrates the order of initialization of
the base classes and derived classes. Now add member objects to both the base and derived
classes and show the order in which their initialization occurs during construction.
Also note that in the above example, a Frog object ‚Äúowns‚Äù its member objects. It creates
them, and it knows how long they should live (as long as the Frog does), so it knows when to
dispose( ) the member objects. However, if one of these member objects is shared with one
or more other objects, the problem becomes more complex and you cannot simply assume
that you can call dispose( ). In this case, reference counting may be necessary to keep track
of the number of objects that are still accessing a shared object. Here's what it looks like:

```java
//: polymorphism/ReferenceCounting.java
// Cleaning up shared member objects.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Shared {
    private int refcount = 0;
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public Shared() {
        print("Creating " + this);
    }
    public void addRef() { refcount++; }
    protected void dispose() {
        if (--refcount == 0)
            print("Disposing " + this);
    }
    public String toString() { return "Shared " + id; }
}

class Composing {
    private Shared shared;
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public Composing(Shared shared) {
        print("Creating " + this);
        this.shared = shared;
        this.shared.addRef();
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        print("disposing " + this);
        shared.dispose();
    }
    public String toString() { return "Composing " + id; }
}

public class ReferenceCounting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shared shared = new Shared();
        Composing[] composing = {
            new Composing(shared),
            new Composing(shared),
            new Composing(shared),
            new Composing(shared),
            new Composing(shared)
        };
        for (Composing c: composing)
            c.dispose();
    }
}/* Output:
Creating Shared 0
Creating Composing 0
Creating Composing 1
Creating Composing 2
Creating Composing 3
Creating Composing 4
disposing Composing 0
disposing Composing 1
disposing Composing 2
disposing Composing 3
disposing Composing 4
Disposing Shared 0
*///:~
```
The static long counter keeps track of the number of instances of Shared that are created,
and it also provides a value for id. The type of counter is long rather than int, to prevent
overflow (this is just good practice; overflowing such a counter is not likely to happen in any
of the examples in this book). The id is final because we do not expect it to change its value
during the lifetime of the object.

When you attach a shared object to your class, you must remember to call addRef( ), but the
dispose( ) method will keep track of the reference count and decide when to actually
perform the cleanup. This technique requires extra diligence to use, but if you are sharing
objects that require cleanup you don't have much choice.

Exercise 13: (3) Add a finalize( ) method to ReferenceCounting.java to verify the
termination condition (see the Initialization & Cleanup chapter).

Exercise 14: (4) Modify Exercise 12 so that one of the member objects is a shared object
with reference counting, and demonstrate that it works properly.

### ‚òò Behavior of polymorphic methods inside constructors
The hierarchy of constructor calls brings up an interesting dilemma. What happens if you're
inside a constructor and you call a dynamically-bound method of the object being
constructed?

Inside an ordinary method, the dynamically-bound call is resolved at run time, because the
object cannot know whether it belongs to the class that the method is in or some class
derived from it.

If you call a dynamically-bound method inside a constructor, the overridden definition for
that method is used. However, the effect of this call can be rather unexpected because the
overridden method will be called before the object is fully constructed. This can conceal some
difficult-to-find bugs.

Conceptually, the constructor's job is to bring the object into existence (which is hardly an
ordinary feat). Inside any constructor, the entire object might be only partially formed‚Äîyou
can only know that the base-class objects have been initialized. If the constructor is only one
step in building an object of a class that's been derived from that constructor's class, the
derived parts have not yet been initialized at the time that the current constructor is being
called. A dynamically bound method call, however, reaches ‚Äúoutward‚Äù into the inheritance
hierarchy. It calls a method in a derived class. If you do this inside a constructor, you call a
method that might manipulate members that haven't been initialized yet‚Äîa sure recipe for
disaster.

You can see the problem in the following example:

```java
//: polymorphism/PolyConstructors.java
// Constructors and polymorphism
// don't produce what you might expect.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Glyph {
    void draw() { print("Glyph.draw()"); }
    Glyph() {
        print("Glyph() before draw()");
        draw();
        print("Glyph() after draw()");
    }
}

class RoundGlyph extends Glyph {
    private int radius = 1;
    RoundGlyph(int r) {
        radius = r;
        print("RoundGlyph.RoundGlyph(), radius = " + radius);
    }
    void draw() {
        print("RoundGlyph.draw(), radius = " + radius);
    }
}

public class PolyConstructors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new RoundGlyph(5);
    }
} /* Output:
Glyph() before draw()
RoundGlyph.draw(), radius = 0
Glyph() after draw()
RoundGlyph.RoundGlyph(), radius = 5
*///:~
```
Glyph. draw( ) is designed to be overridden, which happens in RoundGlyph. But the
Glyph constructor calls this method, and the call ends up in RoundGlyph.draw( ), which
would seem to be the intent. But if you look at the output, you can see that when Glyph's
constructor calls draw( ), the value of radius isn't even the default initial value 1. It's 0.
This would probably result in either a dot or nothing at all being drawn on the screen, and
you'd be left staring, trying to figure out why the program won't work.

The order of initialization described in the earlier section isn't quite complete, and that's the
key to solving the mystery. The actual process of initialization is:
1. The storage allocated for the object is initialized to binary zero before anything else
happens.

2. The base-class constructors are called as described previously. At this point, the
overridden draw( ) method is called (yes, before the RoundGlyph constructor is
called), which discovers a radius value of zero, due to Step 1.

3. Member initializers are called in the order of declaration.

4. The body of the derived-class constructor is called.

There's an upside to this, which is that everything is at least initialized to zero (or whatever
zero means for that particular data type) and not just left as garbage. This includes object
references that are embedded inside a class via composition, which become null. So if you
forget to initialize that reference, you'll get an exception at run time. Everything else gets
zero, which is usually a telltale value when looking at output.

On the other hand, you should be pretty horrified at the outcome of this program. You've
done a perfectly logical thing, and yet the behavior is mysteriously wrong, with no complaints
from the compiler. (C++ produces more rational behavior in this situation.) Bugs like this
could easily be buried and take a long time to discover.

As a result, a good guideline for constructors is, ‚ÄúDo as little as possible to set the object 
into a good state, and if you can possibly avoid it, don't call any other methods in this class.‚Äù

The only safe methods to call inside a constructor are those that are final in the base class. 
(This also applies to private methods, which are automatically final.) These cannot be overridden
and thus cannot produce this kind of surprise. You may not always be able to follow this
guideline, but it's something to strive towards.

Exercise 15: (2) Add a RectangularGlyph to PolyConstructors.java and
demonstrate the problem described in this section.

## üçÄ10.04 Covariant return types
Java SE5 adds covariant return types, which means that an overridden method in a derived
class can return a type derived from the type returned by the base-class method:

```java
//: polymorphism/CovariantReturn.java


class Grain {
    public String toString() { return "Grain"; }
}

class Wheat extends Grain {
    public String toString() { return "Wheat"; }
}

class Mill {
    Grain process() { return new Grain(); }
}

class WheatMill extends Mill {
    Wheat process() { return new Wheat(); }
}

public class CovariantReturn {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Mill m = new Mill();
        Grain g = m.process();
        System.out.println(g);
        m = new WheatMill();
        g = m.process();
        System.out.println(g);
    }
} /* Output:
Grain
Wheat
*///:~
```
The key difference between Java SE5 and earlier versions of java is that the earlier versions
would force the overridden version of process( ) to return Grain, rather than Wheat, even
though Wheat is derived from Grain and thus is still a legitimate return type. Covariant
return types allow the more specific Wheat return type.

### ‚òò Designing with inheritance
Once you learn about polymorphism, it can seem that everything ought to be inherited,
because polymorphism is such a clever tool. This can burden your designs; in fact, if you
choose inheritance first when you're using an existing class to make a new class, things can
become needlessly complicated.

A better approach is to choose composition first, especially when it's not obvious which one
you should use. Composition does not force a design into an inheritance hierarchy. But
composition is also more flexible since it's possible to dynamically choose a type (and thus
behavior) when using composition, whereas inheritance requires an exact type to be known
at compile time. The following example illustrates this:

```java
//: polymorphism/Transmogrify.java
// Dynamically changing the behavior of an object
// via composition (the "State" design pattern).
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Actor {
    public void act() {}
}

class HappyActor extends Actor {
    public void act() { print("HappyActor"); }
}

class SadActor extends Actor {
    public void act() { print("SadActor"); }
}

class Stage {
    private Actor actor = new HappyActor();
    public void change() { actor = new SadActor(); }
    public void performPlay() { actor.act(); }
}

public class Transmogrify {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stage stage = new Stage();
        stage.performPlay();
        stage.change();
        stage.performPlay();
    }
}/* Output:
HappyActor
SadActor
*///:~
```
A Stage object contains a reference to an Actor, which is initialized to a HappyActor
object. This means performPlay( ) produces a particular behavior. But since a reference
can be rebound to a different object at run time, a reference for a SadActor object can be
substituted in actor, and then the behavior produced by performPlay( ) changes. Thus
you gain dynamic flexibility at run time. (This is also called the State Pattern. See Thinking
in Patterns (with Java) at www.MindView.com.) In contrast, you can't decide to inherit
differently at run time; that must be completely determined at compile time.

A general guideline is ‚ÄúUse inheritance to express differences in behavior, and fields to
express variations in state.‚Äù In the preceding example, both are used; two different classes
are inherited to express the difference in the act( ) method, and Stage uses composition to
allow its state to be changed. In this case, that change in state happens to produce a change
in behavior.

Exercise 16: (3) Following the example in Transmogrify.java, create a Starship class
containing an AlertStatus reference that can indicate three different states. Include
methods to change the states.

### ‚òò Substitution vs. extension
It would seem that the cleanest way to create an inheritance hierarchy is to take the ‚Äúpure‚Äù
approach. That is, only methods that have been established in the base class are overridden
in the derived class, as seen in this diagram:

                  +------------+
                  |    Shape   |
                  |------------|
                  |     draw() |
                  |    erase() |
                  +------------+
                        ‚Üë
            /-----------+-----------\
            ‚Üë           ‚Üë           ‚Üë
        +---------+  +---------+  +----------+
        | Circle  |  | Square  |  | Triangle |
        |---------|  |---------|  |----------|
        |  draw() |  |  draw() |  |   draw() |
        | erase() |  | erase() |  |  erase() |
        +---------+  +---------+  +----------+

This can be called a pure ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationship because the interface of a class establishes what
it is. Inheritance guarantees that any derived class will have the interface of the base class
and nothing less. If you follow this diagram, derived classes will also have no more than the
base-class interface.

This can be thought of as pure substitution, because derived class objects can be perfectly
substituted for the base class, and you never need to know any extra information about the
subclasses when you're using them:

That is, the base class can receive any message you can send to the derived class because the
two have exactly the same interface. All you need to do is upcast from the derived class and
never look back to see what exact type of object you're dealing with. Everything is handled
through polymorphism.

When you see it this way, it seems like a pure is-a relationship is the only sensible way to do
things, and any other design indicates muddled thinking and is by definition broken. This too
is a trap. As soon as you start thinking this way, you'll turn around and discover that
extending the interface (which, unfortunately, the keyword extends seems to encourage) is
the perfect solution to a particular problem. This can be termed an ‚Äúis-like-a‚Äù relationship,
because the derived class is like the base class‚Äîit has the same fundamental interface‚Äîbut it
has other features that require additional methods to implement:

While this is also a useful and sensible approach (depending on the situation), it has a
drawback. The extended part of the interface in the derived class is not available from the
base class, so once you upcast, you can't call the new methods:

If you're not upcasting in this case, it won't bother you, but often you'll get into a situation 
in which you need to rediscover the exact type of the object so you can access the extended
methods of that type. The following section shows how this is done.

### ‚òò Downcasting and runtime type information
Since you lose the specific type information via an upcast (moving up the inheritance
hierarchy), it makes sense that to retrieve the type information‚Äîthat is, to move back down
the inheritance hierarchy‚Äîyou use a downcast. However, you know an upcast is always safe
because the base class cannot have a bigger interface than the derived class. Therefore, every
message you send through the base class interface is guaranteed to be accepted. But with a
downcast, you don't really know that a shape (for example) is actually a circle. It could
instead be a triangle or square or some other type.

To solve this problem, there must be some way to guarantee that a downcast is correct, so
that you won't accidentally cast to the wrong type and then send a message that the object
can't accept. This would be quite unsafe.

In some languages (like C++) you must perform a special operation in order to get a type-safe
downcast, but in Java, every cast is checked! So even though it looks like you're just
performing an ordinary parenthesized cast, at run time this cast is checked to ensure that it is
in fact the type you think it is. If it isn't, you get a ClassCastException. This act of checking

types at run time is called runtime type identification (RTTI). The following example
demonstrates the behavior of RTTI:

```java
//: polymorphism/RTTI.java
// Downcasting & Runtime type information (RTTI).
// {ThrowsException}

class Useful {
    public void f() {}
    public void g() {}
}

class MoreUseful extends Useful {
    public void f() {}
    public void g() {}
    public void u() {}
    public void v() {}
    public void w() {}
}

public class RTTI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Useful[] x = {
            new Useful(),
            new MoreUseful()
        };
        x[0].f();
        x[1].g();
        // Compile time: method not found in Useful:
        //! x[1].u();
        ((MoreUseful) x[1]).u(); // Downcast/RTTI
        ((MoreUseful) x[0]).u(); // Exception thrown
    }
}///:~
```
As in the previous diagram, MoreUseful extends the interface of Useful. But since it's
inherited, it can also be upcast to a Useful. You can see this happening in the initialization of
the array x in main( ). Since both objects in the array are of class Useful, you can send the
f( ) and g( ) methods to both, and if you try to call u( ) (which exists only in MoreUseful),
you'll get a compile-time error message.

If you want to access the extended interface of a MoreUseful object, you can try to
downcast. If it's the correct type, it will be successful. Otherwise, you'll get a
ClassCastException. You don't need to write any special code for this exception, since it
indicates a programmer error that could happen anywhere in a program. The
{ThrowsException} comment tag tells this book's build system to expect this program to
throw an exception when it executes.

There's more to RTTI than a simple cast. For example, there's a way to see what type you're
dealing with before you try to downcast it. All of the Type Information chapter is devoted to
the study of different aspects of Java run-time type identification.

Exercise 17: (2) Using the Cycle hierarchy from Exercise 1, add a balance( ) method to
Unicycle and Bicycle, but not to Tricycle. Create instances of all three types and upcast
them to an array of Cycle. Try to call balance( ) on each element of the array and observe
the results. Downcast and call balance( ) and observe what happens.

## üçÄ10.05 Summary
Polymorphism means ‚Äúdifferent forms.‚Äù In object-oriented programming, you have the same
interface from the base class, and different forms using that interface: the different versions
of the dynamically bound methods.

You've seen in this chapter that it's impossible to understand, or even create, an example of
polymorphism without using data abstraction and inheritance. Polymorphism is a feature
that cannot be viewed in isolation (like a switch statement can, for example), but instead
works only in concert, as part of the larger picture of class relationships.

To use polymorphism‚Äîand thus object-oriented techniques‚Äîeffectively in your programs,
you must expand your view of programming to include not just members and messages of an
individual class, but also the commonality among classes and their relationships with each
other. Although this requires significant effort, it's a worthy struggle. The results are faster
program development, better code organization, extensible programs, and easier code
maintenance.

# üìú 11. Interfaces
Interfaces and abstract classes provide more structured way to
separate interface from implementation.

Such mechanisms are not that common in programming languages. C++, for example, only
has indirect support for these concepts. The fact that language keywords exist in Java
indicates that these ideas were considered important enough to provide direct support.

First, we'll look at the abstract class, which is a kind of midway step between an ordinary
class and an interface. Although your first impulse will be to create an interface, the abstract
class is an important and necessary tool for building classes that have some unimplemented
methods. You can't always use a pure interface.

## üçÄ11.01. Abstract classes and methods
In all the ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù examples in the previous chapter, the methods in the base class
Instrument were always ‚Äúdummy‚Äù methods. If these methods are ever called, you've done
something wrong. That's because the intent of Instrument is to create a common interface
for all the classes derived from it.

In those examples, the only reason to establish this common interface is so that it can be
expressed differently for each different subtype. It establishes a basic form, so that you can
say what's common for all the derived classes. Another way of saying this is to call
Instrument an abstract base class, or simply an abstract class.

If you have an abstract class like Instrument, objects of that specific class almost always
have no meaning. You create an abstract class when you want to manipulate a set of classes
through its common interface. Thus, Instrument is meant to express only the interface, and
not a particular implementation, so creating an Instrument object makes no sense, and you'll
probably want to prevent the user from doing it. This can be accomplished by making all
methods in Instrument generate errors, but that delays the information until run time and
requires reliable exhaustive testing on the user's part. It's usually better to catch problems at
compile time.

Java provides a mechanism for doing this called the abstract method. ¬π This is a method that
is incomplete; it has only a declaration and no method body. Here is the syntax for an
abstract method declaration.

    abstract void f( );

¬π For C++ programmers, this ist he analogue of C++'s pure virtual function.

A class containing abstract methods is called an abstract class. If a class contains one or more
abstract methods, the class itself must be qualified as abstract. (Otherwise, the compiler
gives you an error message.)

If an abstract class is incomplete, what is the compiler supposed to do when someone tries to
make an object of that class? It cannot safely create an object of an abstract class, so you get
an error message from the compiler. This way, the compiler ensures the purity of the abstract
class, and you don't need to worry about misusing it.

If you inherit from an abstract class and you want to make objects of the new type, you must
provide method definitions for all the abstract methods in the base class. If you don't (and
you may choose not to), then the derived class is also abstract, and the compiler will force
you to qualify that class with the abstract keyword.

It's possible to make a class abstract without including any abstract methods. This is
useful when you've got a class in which it doesn't make sense to have any abstract methods,
and yet you want to prevent any instances of that class.

The Instrument class from the previous chapter can easily be turned into an abstract
class. Only some of the methods will be abstract, since making a class abstract doesn't force
you to make all the methods abstract. Here's what it looks like:

Here's the orchestra example modified to use abstract classes and methods:

```java
//: interfaces/music4/Music4.java
// Abstract classes and methods.
package interfaces.music4;
import polymorphism.music.Note;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

abstract class Instrument {
    private int i; // Storage allocated for each
    public abstract void play(Note n);
    public String what() { return "Instrument"; }
    public abstract void adjust();
}

class Wind extends Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Wind.play() " + n);
    }
    public String what() { return "Wind"; }
    public void adjust() {}
}

class Percussion extends Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Percussion.play() " + n);
    }
    public String what() { return "Percussion"; }
    public void adjust() {}
}

class Stringed extends Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Stringed.play() " + n);
    }
    public String what() { return "Stringed"; }
    public void adjust() {}
}

class Brass extends Wind {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Brass.play() " + n);
    }
    public void adjust() { print("Brass.adjust()"); }
}

class Woodwind extends Wind {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print("Woodwind.play() " + n);
    }
    public String what() { return "Woodwind"; }
}

public class Music4 {
    // Doesn't care about type, so new types
    // added to the system still work right:
    static void tune(Instrument i) {
        // ...
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    static void tuneAll(Instrument[] e) {
        for (Instrument i: e)
            tune(i);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Upcasting during addition to the array:
        Instrument[] orchestra = {
            new Wind(),
            new Percussion(),
            new Stringed(),
            new Brass(),
            new Woodwind()
        };
        tuneAll(orchestra);
    }
} /* Output:
Wind.play() MIDDLE_C
Percussion.play() MIDDLE_C
Stringed.play() MIDDLE_C
Brass.play() MIDDLE_C
Woodwind.play() MIDDLE_C
*///:~
```
You can see that there's really no change except in the base class.

It's helpful to create abstract classes and methods because they make the abstractness of a
class explicit, and tell both the user and the compiler how it was intended to be used.

Abstract classes are also useful refactoring tolls, since they allow you to easily move common
methods up the inheritance hierarchy.

Exercise 1: (1) Modify Exercise 9 in the previous chapter so that Rodent is an abstract
class. Make the methods of Rodent abstract whenever possible.

Exercise 2: (1) Create a class as abstract without including any abstract methods and
verify that you cannot create any instances of that class.

Exercise 3: (2) Create a base class with an abstract print( ) method that is overridden
in a derived class. The overridden version of the method prints the value of an int variable
defined in the derived class. At the point of definition of this variable, give it a nonzero value.
In the base-class constructor, call this method. In main( ), create an object of the derived
type, and then call its print( ) method. Explain the results.

Exercise 4: (3) Create an abstract class with no methods. Derive a class and add a
method. Create a static method that takes a reference to the base class, downcasts it to the
derived class, and calls the method. In main( ), demonstrate that it works. Now put the
abstract declaration for the method in the base class, thus eliminating the need for the
downcast.

## üçÄ11.02. Interfaces
The interface keyword takes the concept of abstractness one step further. The abstract
keyword allows you to create one or more undefined methods in a class‚Äîyou provide part of
the interface without providing a corresponding implementation. The implementation is
provided by inheritors. The interface keyword produces a completely abstract class, one
that provides no implementation at all. It allows the creator to determine method names,
argument lists, and return types, but no method bodies. An interface provides only a form,
but no implementation.

An interface says, "All classes that implement this particular interface will look like this."
Thus, any code that uses a particular interface knows what methods might be called for that
interface, and that's all. So the interface is used to establish a "protocol" between classes.
(Some object-oriented programming languages have a keyword called protocol to do the
same thing.)

However, an interface is more than just an abstract class taken to the extreme, since it allows
you to perform a variation of "multiple inheritance" by creating a class that can be upcast to
more than one base type.

To create an interface, use the interface keyword instead of the class keyword. As with a
class, you can add the public keyword before the interface keyword (but only if that
interface is defined in a file of the same name). If you leave off the public keyword, you get
package access, so the interface is only usable within the same package. An interface can also
contain fields, but these are implicitly static and final.

To make a class that conforms to a particular interface (or group of interfaces), use the
implements keyword, which says, "The interface is what it looks like, but now I'm going to
say how it works." Other than that, it looks like inheritance. The diagram for the instrument
example shows this:


You can see from the Woodwind and Brass classes that once you've implemented an
interface, that implementation becomes an ordinary class that can be extended in the regular
way.

You can choose to explicitly declare the methods in an interface as public, but they are
public even if you don't say it. So when you implement an interface, the methods from the
interface must be defined as public. Otherwise, they would default to package access, and
you'd be reducing the accessibility of a method during inheritance, which is not allowed by
the Java compiler.

You can see this in the modified version of the Instrument example. Note that every
method in the interface is strictly a declaration, which is the only thing the compiler allows.
In addition, none of the methods in Instrument are declared as public, but they're
automatically public anyway:

```java
//: interfaces/music5/Music5.java
// Interfaces.
package interfaces.music5;
import polymorphism.music.Note;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Instrument {
    // Compile-time constant:
    int VALUE = 5; // static & final
    // Cannot have method definitions:
    void play(Note n); // Automatically public
    void adjust();
}

class Wind implements Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print(this + ".play() " + n);
    }
    public String toString() { return "Wind"; }
    public void adjust() { print(this + ".adjust()"); }
}

class Percussion implements Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print(this + ".play() " + n);
    }
    public String toString() { return "Percussion"; }
    public void adjust() { print(this + ".adjust()"); }
}

class Stringed implements Instrument {
    public void play(Note n) {
        print(this + ".play() " + n);
    }
    public String toString() { return "Stringed"; }
    public void adjust() { print(this + ".adjust()"); }
}

class Brass extends Wind {
    public String toString() { return "Brass"; }
}

class Woodwind extends Wind {
    public String toString() { return "Woodwind"; }
}

public class Music5 {
    // Doesn't care about type, so new types
    // added to the system still work right:
    static void tune(Instrument i) {
        // ...
        i.play(Note.MIDDLE_C);
    }
    static void tuneAll(Instrument[] e) {
        for (Instrument i: e)
            tune(i);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Upcasting during addition to the array:
        Instrument[] orchestra = {
            new Wind(),
            new Percussion(),
            new Stringed(),
            new Brass(),
            new Woodwind()
        };
        tuneAll(orchestra);
    }
}/* Output:
Wind.play() MIDDLE_C
Percussion.play() MIDDLE_C
Stringed.play() MIDDLE_C
Brass.play() MIDDLE_C
Woodwind.play() MIDDLE_C
*///:~
```
One other change has been made to this version of the example: The what( ) method has
been changed to toString( ), since that was how the method was being used. Since
toString( ) is part of the root class Object, it doesn't need to appear in the interface.
The rest of the code works the same. Notice that it doesn't matter if you are upcasting to a
"regular" class called Instrument, an abstract class called Instrument, or to an interface
called Instrument. The behavior is the same. In fact, you can see in the tune( ) method
that there isn't any evidence about whether Instrument is a "regular" class, an abstract
class, or an interface.

Exercise 5: (2) Create an interface containing three methods, in its own package.
Implement the interface in a different package.

Exercise 6: (2) Prove that all the methods in an interface are automatically public.

Exercise 7: (1) Change Exercise 9 in the Polymorphism chapter so that Rodent is an
interface.

Exercise 8: (2) In polymorphism.Sandwich.java, create an interface called
FastFoo d (with appropriate methods) and change Sandwic h so that it also implements
FastFood.

Exercise 9: (3) Refactor Musics.java by moving the common methods in Wind,
Percussion and Stringed into an abstract class.

Exercise 10: (3) Modify Musics.java by adding a Playable interface. Move the play( )
declaration from Instrument to Playable. Add Playable to the derived classes by
including it in the implement s list. Change tune( ) so that it takes a Playable instead of
an Instrument.

## üçÄ11.03. Complete decoupling
Whenever a method works with a class instead of an interface, you are limited to using that
class or its subclasses. If you would like to apply the method to a class that isn't in that
hierarchy, you're out of luck. An interface relaxes this constraint considerably. As a result, it
allows you to write more reusable code.

For example, suppose you have a Processor class that has a name( ) and a process( )
method that takes input, modifies it and produces output. The base class is extended to
create different types of Processor. In this case, the Processor subtypes modify String objects
(note that the return types can be covariant, but not the argument types):

```java
//: interfaces/classprocessor/Apply.java
package interfaces.classprocessor;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Processor {
    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    Object process(Object input) { return input; }
}

class Upcase extends Processor {
    String process(Object input) { // Covariant return
        return ((String) input).toUpperCase();
    }
}

class Downcase extends Processor {
    String process(Object input) {
        return ((String) input).toLowerCase();
    }
}

class Splitter extends Processor {
    String process(Object input) {
        // The split() argument divides a String into pieces:
        return Arrays.toString(((String) input).split(" "));
    }
}

public class Apply {
    public static void process(Processor p, Object s) {
        print("Using Processor " + p.name());
        print(p.process(s));
    }
    public static String s =
        "Disagreement with beliefs is by definition incorrect";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        process(new Upcase(), s);
        process(new Downcase(), s);
        process(new Splitter(), s);
    }
} /* Output:
Using Processor Upcase

The Apply.process( ) method takes any kind of Processor and applies it to an Object,
then prints the results. Creating a method that behaves differently depending on the
argument object that you pass it is called the Strategy design pattern. The method contains
the fixed part of the algorithm to be performed, and the Strategy contains the part that
varies. The Strategy is the object that you pass in, and it contains code to be executed. Here,
the Processor object is the Strategy, and in main( ) you can see three different Strategies
applied to the String s.

The split( ) method is part of the String class. It takes the String object and splits it using
the argument as a boundary, and returns a String[]. It is used here as a shorter way of
creating an array of String.

Now suppose you discover a set of electronic filters that seem like they could fit into your
Apply.process( ) method:

```java
//: interfaces/filters/Waveform.java
package interfaces.filters;

public class Waveform {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public String toString() { return "Waveform " + id; }
} ///:~
```


```java
//: interfaces/filters/Filter.java
package interfaces.filters;

public class Filter {
    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~
```


```java
//: interfaces/filters/LowPass.java
package interfaces.filters;

public class LowPass extends Filter {
double cutoff;
public LowPass(double cutoff) { this.cutoff = cutoff; }
public Waveform process(Waveform input) {
return input; // Dummy processing
}
} ///:~
```


```java
//: interfaces/filters/HighPass.java
package interfaces.filters;

public class HighPass extends Filter {
    double cutoff;
    public HighPass(double cutoff) { this.cutoff = cutoff; }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~
```


```java
//: interfaces/filters/BandPass.java
package interfaces.filters;

public class BandPass extends Filter {
    double lowCutoff, highCutoff;
    public BandPass(double lowCut, double highCut) {
        lowCutoff = lowCut;
        highCutoff = highCut;
    }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~
```
Filter has the same interface elements as Processor, but because it isn't inherited from
Processor‚Äîbecause the creator of the Filter class had no clue you might want to use it as a
Processor‚Äîyou can't use a Filter with the Apply.process( ) method, even though it
would work fine. Basically, the coupling between Apply.process( ) and Processor is
stronger than it needs to be, and this prevents the Apply.process( ) code from being reused
when it ought to be. Also notice that the inputs and outputs are both Waveforms.

If Processor is an interface, however, the constraints are loosened enough that you can
reuse an Apply.process( ) that takes that interface. Here are the modified versions of
Processor and Apply:


```java
//: interfaces/interfaceprocessor/Processor.java
package interfaces.interfaceprocessor;

public interface Processor {
    String name();
    Object process(Object input);
} ///:~
```


```java
//: interfaces/interfaceprocessor/Apply.java
package interfaces.interfaceprocessor;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Apply {
    public static void process(Processor p, Object s) {
        print("Using Processor " + p.name());
        print(p.process(s));
    }
} ///:~
```
The first way you can reuse code is if client programmers can write their classes to conform
to the interface, like this:

```java
//: interfaces/interfaceprocessor/StringProcessor.java
package interfaces.interfaceprocessor;
import java.util.*;

public abstract class StringProcessor implements Processor {
    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    public abstract String process(Object input);
    public static String s =
        "If she weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Apply.process(new Upcase(), s);
        Apply.process(new Downcase(), s);
        Apply.process(new Splitter(), s);
    }
}

class Upcase extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) { // Covariant return
        return ((String) input).toUpperCase();
    }
}

class Downcase extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) {
        return ((String) input).toLowerCase();
    }
}

class Splitter extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) {
        return Arrays.toString(((String) input).split(" "));
    }
}/* Output:
Using Processor Upcase
IF SHE WEIGHS THE SAME AS A DUCK, SHE'S MADE OF WOOD
Using Processor Downcase
if she weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood
Using Processor Splitter
[If, she, weighs, the, same, as, a, duck,, she's, made, of, wood]
*///:~
```
However, you are often in the situation of not being able to modify the classes that you want
to use. In the case of the electronic filters, for example, the library was discovered rather than
created. In these cases, you can use the Adapter design pattern. In Adapter, you write code to
take the interface that you have and produce the interface that you need, like this:

```java
//: interfaces/interfaceprocessor/FilterProcessor.java
package interfaces.interfaceprocessor;
import interfaces.filters.*;

class FilterAdapter implements Processor {
    Filter filter;
    public FilterAdapter(Filter filter) {
        this.filter = filter;
    }
    public String name() { return filter.name(); }
    public Waveform process(Object input) {
        return filter.process((Waveform) input);
    }
}

public class FilterProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Waveform w = new Waveform();
        Apply.process(new FilterAdapter(new LowPass(1.0)), w);
        Apply.process(new FilterAdapter(new HighPass(2.0)), w);
        Apply.process(
            new FilterAdapter(new BandPass(3.0, 4.0)), w);
    }
} /* Output:
Using Processor LowPass
Waveform 0
Using Processor HighPass
Waveform 0
Using Processor BandPass
Waveform 0
*///:~
```
In this approach to Adapter, the FilterAdapter constructor takes the interface that you
have‚ÄîFilter‚Äîand produces an object that has the Processor interface that you need. You
may also notice delegation in the FilterAdapter class.

Decoupling interface from implementation allows an interface to be applied to multiple
different implementations, and thus your code is more reusable.

Exercise 11: (4) Create a class with a method that takes a String argument and produces
a result that swaps each pair of characters in that argument. Adapt the class so that it works
with interfaceprocessor.Apply.process( ).

## üçÄ11.04. ‚ÄúMultiple inheritance‚Äù in Java
Because an interface has no implementation at all‚Äîthat is, there is no storage associated with
an interface‚Äîthere's nothing to prevent many interfaces from being combined. This is
valuable because there are times when you need to say, "An x is an a and a b and a c." In
C++, this act of combining multiple class interfaces is called multiple inheritance, and it
carries some rather sticky baggage because each class can have an implementation. In Java,
you can perform the same act, but only one of the classes can have an implementation, so the
C++ problems do not occur with Java when combining multiple interfaces:

In a derived class, you aren't forced to have a base class that is either abstract or "concrete"
(one with no abstract methods). If you do inherit from a non-interface, you can inherit from
only one. All the rest of the base elements must be interfaces. You place all the interface
names after the implements keyword and separate them with commas. You can have as
many interfaces as you want. You can upcast to each interface, because each interface is an
independent type. The following example shows a concrete class combined with several
interfaces to produce a new class:

```java
//: interfaces/Adventure.java
// Multiple interfaces.

interface CanFight {
    void fight();
}

interface CanSwim {
    void swim();
}

interface CanFly {
    void fly();
}

class ActionCharacter {
    public void fight() {}
}

class Hero extends ActionCharacter
implements CanFight, CanSwim, CanFly {
    public void swim() {}
    public void fly() {}
}

public class Adventure {
    public static void t(CanFight x) { x.fight(); }
    public static void u(CanSwim x) { x.swim(); }
    public static void v(CanFly x) { x.fly(); }
    public static void w(ActionCharacter x) { x.fight(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Hero h = new Hero();
        t(h); // Treat it as a CanFight
        u(h); // Treat it as a CanSwim
        v(h); // Treat it as a CanFly
        w(h); // Treat it as an ActionCharacter
    }
}///:~
```
You can see that Hero combines the concrete class ActionCharacter with the interfaces
CanFight, CanSwim, and CanFly. When you combine a concrete class with interfaces this
way, the concrete class must come first, then the interfaces. (The compiler gives an error
otherwise.)

The signature for fight( ) is the same in the interface CanFight and the class
ActionCharacter, and that fight( ) is not provided with a definition in Hero. You can
extend an interface, but then you've got another interface. When you want to create an
object, all the definitions must first exist. Even though Hero does not explicitly provide a
definition for fight( ), the definition comes along with ActionCharacter; thus, it's possible
to create Hero objects.

In class Adventure, you can see that there are four methods that take arguments of the
various interfaces and of the concrete class. When a Hero object is created, it can be passed
to any of these methods, which means it is being upcast to each interface in turn. Because of
the way interfaces are designed in Java, this works without any particular effort on the part of
the programmer.

Keep in mind that one of the core reasons for interfaces is shown in the preceding example:
to upcast to more than one base type (and the flexibility that this provides). However, a
second reason for using interfaces is the same as using an abstract base class: to prevent the
client programmer from making an object of this class and to establish that it is only an
interface.

This brings up a question: Should you use an interface or an abstract class? If it's possible to
create your base class without any method definitions or member variables, you should
always prefer interfaces to abstract classes. In fact, if you know something is going to be a
base class, you can consider making it an interface (this subject will be revisited in the
chapter summary).

Exercise 12: (2) In Adventure.java, add an interface called CanClimb, following the
form of the other interfaces.

Exercise 13: (2) Create an interface, and inherit two new interfaces from that interface.
Multiply inherit a third interface from the second two. ¬≤

## üçÄ11.05. Extending an interface with inheritance
You can easily add new method declarations to an interface by using inheritance, and you can
also combine several interfaces into a new interface with inheritance. In both cases you get a
new interface, as seen in this example:

¬≤ This shows how interfaces prevent the "diamond problem" that occurs with C++ multiple inheritance.

```java
//: interfaces/HorrorShow.java
// Extending an interface with inheritance.

interface Monster {
    void menace();
}

interface DangerousMonster extends Monster {
    void destroy();
}

interface Lethal {
    void kill();
}

class DragonZilla implements DangerousMonster {
    public void menace() {}
    public void destroy() {}
}

interface Vampire extends DangerousMonster, Lethal {
    void drinkBlood();
}

class VeryBadVampire implements Vampire {
    public void menace() {}
    public void destroy() {}
    public void kill() {}
    public void drinkBlood() {}
}

public class HorrorShow {
    static void u(Monster b) { b.menace(); }
    static void v(DangerousMonster d) {
        d.menace();
        d.destroy();
    }
    static void w(Lethal l) { l.kill(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DangerousMonster barney = new DragonZilla();
        u(barney);
        v(barney);
        Vampire vlad = new VeryBadVampire();
        u(vlad);
        v(vlad);
        w(vlad);
    }
} ///:~
```
DangerousMonster is a simple extension to Monster that produces a new interface. This
is implemented in DragonZilla.

The syntax used in Vampire works only when inheriting interfaces. Normally, you can use
extends with only a single class, but extends can refer to multiple base interfaces when
building a new interface. As you can see, the interface names are simply separated with
commas.

Exercise 14: (2) Create three interfaces, each with two methods. Inherit a new interface
that combines the three, adding a new method. Create a class by implementing the new
interface and also inheriting from a concrete class. Now write four methods, each of which
takes one of the four interfaces as an argument. In main( ), create an object of your class
and pass it to each of the methods.

Exercise 15: (2) Modify the previous exercise by creating an abstract class and
inheriting that into the derived class.

## üçÄ11.06. Name collisions when combining Interfaces
You can encounter a small pitfall when implementing multiple interfaces. In the preceding
example, both CanFight and ActionCharacter have identical void fight( ) methods. An
identical method is not a problem, but what if the method differs by signature or return type?
Here's an example:

```java
//: interfaces/InterfaceCollision.java
package interfaces;

interface I1 { void f(); }
interface I2 { int f(int i); }
interface I3 { int f(); }
class C { public int f() { return 1; } }

class C2 implements I1, I2 {
    public void f() {}
    public int f(int i) { return 1; } // overloaded
}

class C3 extends C implements I2 {
    public int f(int i) { return 1; } // overloaded
}

class C4 extends C implements I3 {
    // Identical, no problem:
    public int f() { return 1; }
}

// Methods differ only by return type:
//! class C5 extends C implements I1 {}
//! interface I4 extends I1, I3 {} ///:~
```
The difficulty occurs because overriding, implementation, and overloading get unpleasantly
mixed together. Also, overloaded methods cannot differ only by return type. When the last
two lines are uncommented, the error messages say it all:

    InterfaceCollision.java:23: f() in C cannot implementf() in It; attempting to use
    incompatible return type
    found: int
    required: void
    InterfaceCollision.java:24: Interfaces I3 andh are incompatible; both define f(), but with
    different return type

Using the same method names in different interfaces that are intended to be combined
generally causes confusion in the readability of the code, as well. Strive to avoid it.

## üçÄ11.07. Adapting to an interface
One of the most compelling reasons for interfaces is to allow multiple implementations for
the same interface. In simple cases this is in the form of a method that accepts an interface,
leaving it up to you to implement that interface and pass your object to the method.

Thus, a common use for interfaces is the aforementioned Strategy design pattern. You write
a method that performs certain operations, and that method takes an interface that you also
specify. You're basically saying, "You can use my method with any object you like, as long as
your object conforms to my interface." This makes your method more flexible, general and
reusable.

For example, the constructor for the Java SE5 Scanner class (which you'll learn more about
in the Strings chapter) takes a Readable interface. You'll find that Readable is not an
argument for any other method in the Java standard library‚Äîit was created solely for
Scanner, so that Scanner doesn't have to constrain its argument to be a particular class.
This way, Scanner can be made to work with more types. If you create a new class and you
want it to be usable with Scanner, you make it Readable, like this:

```java
//: interfaces/RandomWords.java
// Implementing an interface to conform to a method.
import java.nio.*;
import java.util.*;

public class RandomWords implements Readable {
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    private static final char[] capitals =
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".toCharArray();
    private static final char[] lowers =
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".toCharArray();
    private static final char[] vowels =
        "aeiou".toCharArray();
    private int count;
    public RandomWords(int count) { this.count = count; }
    public int read(CharBuffer cb) {
        if (count-- == 0)
            return -1; // Indicates end of input
        cb.append(capitals[rand.nextInt(capitals.length)]);
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            cb.append(vowels[rand.nextInt(vowels.length)]);
            cb.append(lowers[rand.nextInt(lowers.length)]);
        }
        cb.append(" ");
        return 10; // Number of characters appended
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(new RandomWords(10));
        while (s.hasNext())
            System.out.println(s.next());
    }
} /* Output:

Fowenucor
Goeazimom

*///:~
```
The Readable interface only requires the implementation of a read( ) method. Inside
read( ), you add to the CharBuffer argument (there are several ways to do this; see the
CharBuffer documentation), or return -l when you have no more input.

Suppose you have a class that does not already implement Readable‚Äîhow do you make it
work with Scanner? Here's an example of a class that produces random floating point
numbers:

```java
//: interfaces/RandomDoubles.java
import java.util.*;

public class RandomDoubles {
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    public double next() { return rand.nextDouble(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RandomDoubles rd = new RandomDoubles();
        for(int i = 0; i < 7; i ++)
        System.out.print(rd.next() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:

0.2613610344283964
*///:~
```
Because you can add an interface onto any existing class in this way, it means that a method
that takes an interface provides a way for any class to be adapted to work with that method.
This is the power of using interfaces instead of classes.

Exercise 16: (3) Create a class that produces a sequence of chars. Adapt this class so
that it can be an input to a Scanner object.

## üçÄ11.08. Fields in interfaces
Because any fields you put into an interface are automatically static and final, the interface
is a convenient tool for creating groups of constant values. Before Java SE5, this was the only
way to produce the same effect as an enum in C or C++. So you will see pre-Java SE5 code
like this:

```java
//: interfaces/Months.java
// Using interfaces to create groups of constants.
package interfaces;

public interface Months {
    int
    JANUARY = 1, FEBRUARY = 2, MARCH = 3,
    APRIL = 4, MAY = 5, JUNE = 6, JULY = 7,
    AUGUST = 8, SEPTEMBER = 9, OCTOBER = 10,
    NOVEMBER = 11, DECEMBER = 12;
} ///:~
```
Notice the Java style of using all uppercase letters (with underscores to separate multiple
words in a single identifier) for static finals that have constant initializers. The fields in an
interface are automatically public, so that is not explicitly specified.

With Java SE5, you now have the much more powerful and flexible enum keyword, so it
rarely makes sense to use interfaces for constants anymore. However, you will probably run
across the old idiom on many occasions when reading legacy code (the supplements for this
book at www.MindView.net contain a complete description of the pre-Java SE5 approach to
producing enumerated types using interfaces). You can find more details about using enums
in the Enumerated Types chapter.

Exercise 17: (2) Prove that the fields in an interface are implicitly static and final.

## üçÄ11.09. Initializing fields in interfaces
Fields defined in interfaces cannot be "blank finals," but they can be initialized with non-
constant expressions. For example:

```java
//: interfaces/RandVals.java
// Initializing interface fields with
// non-constant initializers.
import java.util.*;

public interface RandVals {
    Random RAND = new Random(47);
    int RANDOM_INT = RAND.nextInt(10);
    long RANDOM_LONG = RAND.nextLong() * 10;
    float RANDOM_FLOAT = RAND.nextLong() * 10;
    double RANDOM_DOUBLE = RAND.nextDouble() * 10;
} ///:~
```
Since the fields are static, they are initialized when the class is first loaded, which happens
when any of the fields are accessed for the first time. Here's a simple test:

```java
//: interfaces/TestRandVals.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class TestRandVals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(RandVals.RANDOM_INT);
        print(RandVals.RANDOM_LONG);
        print(RandVals.RANDOM_FLOAT);
        print(RandVals.RANDOM_DOUBLE);
    }
} /* Output:
8
-32032247016559954
-8.5939291E18
5.779976127815049
*///:~
```
The fields, of course, are not part of the interface. The values are stored in the static storage
area for that interface.

## üçÄ11.10. Nesting interfaces
Interfaces may be nested within classes and within other interfaces. ¬≥ This reveals a number
of interesting features:
¬≥ Thanks to Martin Danner for asking about this during a seminar.

```java
//: interfaces/nesting/NestingInterfaces.java
package interfaces.nesting;

class A {
    interface B {
        void f();
    }
    public class BImp implements B {
        public void f() {}
    }
    private class BImp2 implements B {
        public void f() {}
    }
    public interface C {
        void f();
    }
    class CImp implements C {
        public void f() {}
    }
    private class CImp2 implements C {
        public void f() {}
    }
    private interface D {
        void f();
    }
    private class DImp implements D {
        public void f() {}
    }
    public class DImp2 implements D {
        public void f() {}
    }
    public D getD() { return new DImp2(); }
    private D dRef;
    public void receiveD(D d) {
        dRef = d;
        dRef.f();
    }
}

interface E {
    interface G {
        void f();
    }
    // Redundant "public":
    public interface H {
        void f();
    }
    void g();
    // Cannot be private within an interface:
    //! private interface I {}
}

public class NestingInterfaces {

    public class BImp implements A.B {
        public void f() {}
    }
    class CImp implements A.C {
        public void f() {}
    }
    // Cannot implement a private interface except
    // within that interface's defining class:
    //! class DImp implements A.D {
    //! public void f() {}
    //! }
    class EImp implements E {
        public void g() {}
    }
    class EGImp implements E.G {
        public void f() {}
    }
    class EImp2 implements E {
        public void g() {}
        class EG implements E.G {
            public void f() {}
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        // Can't access A.D:
        //! A.D ad = a.getD();
        // Doesn't return anything but A.D:
        //! A.DImp2 di2 = a.getD();
        // Cannot access a member of the interface:
        //! a.getD().f();
        // Only another A can do anything with getD():
        A a2 = new A();
        a2.receiveD(a.getD());
    }
} ///:~
```
The syntax for nesting an interface within a class is reasonably obvious. Just like non-nested
interfaces, these can have public or package-access visibility.

As an added twist, interfaces can also be private, as seen in A.D (the same qualification
syntax is used for nested interfaces as for nested classes). What good is a private nested
interface? You might guess that it can only be implemented as a private inner class as in
DImp, but A.DImp2 shows that it can also be implemented as a public class. However,
A.DImp2 can only be used as itself. You are not allowed to mention the fact that it
implements the private interface D, so implementing a private interface is a way to force
the definition of the methods in that interface without adding any type information (that is,
without allowing any upcasting).

The method getD( ) produces a further quandary concerning the private interface: It's a
public method that returns a reference to a private interface. What can you do with the
return value of this method? In main( ), you can see several attempts to use the return
value, all of which fail. The only thing that works is if the return value is handed to an object
that has permission to use it‚Äîin this case, another A, via the receiveD( ) method.
Interface E shows that interfaces can be nested within each other. However, the rules about
interfaces‚Äîin particular, that all interface elements must be public‚Äîare strictly enforced
here, so an interface nested within another interface is automatically public and cannot be
made private.

Nestinglnterfaces shows the various ways that nested interfaces can be implemented. In
particular, notice that when you implement an interface, you are not required to implement
any interfaces nested within. Also, private interfaces cannot be implemented outside of
their defining classes.

Initially, these features may seem like they are added strictly for syntactic consistency, but I
generally find that once you know about a feature, you often discover places where it is
useful.

## üçÄ11.11. Interfaces and factories
An interface is intended to be a gateway to multiple implementations, and a typical way to
produce objects that fit the interface is the Factory Method design pattern. Instead of calling
a constructor directly, you call a creation method on a factory object which produces an
implementation of the interface‚Äîthis way, in theory, your code is completely isolated from
the implementation of the interface, thus making it possible to transparently swap one
implementation for another. Here's a demonstration showing the structure of the Factory
Method:

```java
//: interfaces/Factories.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Service {
    void method1();
    void method2();
}

interface ServiceFactory {
    Service getService();
}

class Implementation1 implements Service {
    Implementation1() {} // Package access
    public void method1() { print("Implementation1 method1"); }
    public void method2() { print("Implementation1 method2"); }
}

class Implementation1Factory implements ServiceFactory {
    public Service getService() {
        return new Implementation1();
    }
}

class Implementation2 implements Service {
    Implementation2() {} // Package access
    public void method1() { print("Implementation2 method1"); }
    public void method2() { print("Implementation2 method2"); }
}

class Implementation2Factory implements ServiceFactory {
    public Service getService() {
        return new Implementation2();
    }
}

public class Factories {
    public static void serviceConsumer(ServiceFactory fact) {
        Service s = fact.getService();
        s.method1();
        s.method2();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        serviceConsumer(new Implementation1Factory());
        // Implementations are completely interchangeable:
        serviceConsumer(new Implementation2Factory());
    }
} /* Output:
Implementation1 method1
Implementation1 method2
Implementation2 method1
Implementation2 method2
*///:~
```
Without the Factory Method, your code would somewhere have to specify the exact type of
Service being created, so that it could call the appropriate constructor.

Why would you want to add this extra level of indirection? One common reason is to create a
framework. Suppose you are creating a system to play games; for example, to play both chess
and checkers on the same board:

```java
//: interfaces/Games.java
// A Game framework using Factory Methods.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Game { boolean move(); }
interface GameFactory { Game getGame(); }

class Checkers implements Game {
    private int moves = 0;
    private static final int MOVES = 3;
    public boolean move() {
        print("Checkers move " + moves);
        return ++moves != MOVES;
    }
}

class CheckersFactory implements GameFactory {
    public Game getGame() { return new Checkers(); }
}

class Chess implements Game {
    private int moves = 0;
    private static final int MOVES = 4;
    public boolean move() {
        print("Chess move " + moves);
        return ++moves != MOVES;
    }
}

class ChessFactory implements GameFactory {
    public Game getGame() { return new Chess(); }
}

public class Games {
    public static void playGame(GameFactory factory) {
        Game s = factory.getGame();
        while (s.move())
        ;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        playGame(new CheckersFactory());
        playGame(new ChessFactory());
    }
}/* Output:
Checkers move 0
Checkers move 1
Checkers move 2
Chess move 0
Chess move 1
Chess move 2
Chess move 3
*///:~
```
If the Games class represents a complex piece of code, this approach allows you to reuse
that code with different types of games. You can imagine more elaborate games that can
benefit from this pattern. In the next chapter, you'll see a more elegant way to implement the
factories using anonymous inner classes.

Exercise 18: (2) Create a Cycle interface, with implementations Unicycle, Bicycle
and Tricycle. Create factories for each type of Cycle, and code that uses these factories.

Exercise 19: (3) Create a framework using Factory Methods that performs both coin
tossing and dice tossing.

## üçÄ11.12. Summary
It is tempting to decide that interfaces are good, and therefore you should always choose
interfaces over concrete classes. Of course, almost anytime you create a class, you could
instead create an interface and a factory.

Many people have fallen to this temptation, creating interfaces and factories wherever it's
possible. The logic seems to be that you might need to use a different implementation, so you
should always add that abstraction. It has become a kind of premature design optimization.
Any abstraction should be motivated by a real need. Interfaces should be something you
refactor to when necessary, rather than installing the extra level of indirection everywhere,
along with the extra complexity. That extra complexity is significant, and if you make
someone work through that complexity only to realize that you've added interfaces "just in
case" and for no compelling reason‚Äîwell, if I see such a thing I begin to question all the
designs that this particular person has done.

An appropriate guideline is to prefer classes to interfaces. Start with classes, and if it
becomes clear that interfaces are necessary, then refactor. Interfaces are a great tool, but they
can easily be overused.

# üìú 12. Inner Classes
It's possible to place a class definition within another class definition.
This is called an inner class.

The inner class is a valuable feature because it allows you to group classes that logically
belong together and to control the visibility of one within the other. However, it's important
to understand that inner classes are distinctly different from composition.

At first, inner classes look like a simple code-hiding mechanism: You place classes inside
other classes. You'll learn, however, that the inner class does more than that‚Äîit knows about
and can communicate with the surrounding class‚Äîand the kind of code you can write with
inner classes is more elegant and clear, although there's certainly no guarantee of this.
Initially, inner classes may seem odd, and it will take some time to become comfortable using
them in your designs. The need for inner classes isn't always obvious, but after the basic
syntax and semantics of inner classes have been described, the section "Why inner classes?"
should begin to make clear the benefits of inner classes.

After that section, the remainder of the chapter contains more detailed explorations of the
syntax of inner classes. These features are provided for language completeness, but you
might not need to use them, at least not at first. So the initial parts of the chapter might be all
you need for now, and you can leave the more detailed explorations as reference material.

## üçÄ12.01. Creating inner classes
You create an inner class just as you'd expect‚Äîby placing the class definition inside a
surrounding class:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel1.java
// Creating inner classes.

public class Parcel1 {
    class Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    class Destination {
        private String label;
        Destination(String whereTo) {
            label = whereTo;
        }
        String readLabel() { return label; }
    }
    // Using inner classes looks just like
    // using any other class, within Parcel1:
    public void ship(String dest) {
        Contents c = new Contents();
        Destination d = new Destination(dest);
        System.out.println(d.readLabel());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel1 p = new Parcel1();
        p.ship("Tasmania");
    }

} /* Output:
Tasmania
*///:~
```
The inner classes used inside ship( ) look just like ordinary classes. Here, the only practical
difference is that the names are nested within Parceli. You'll see in a while that this isn't the
only difference. More typically, an outer class will have a method that returns a reference to
an inner class, as you can see in the to( ) and contents( ) methods:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel2.java
// Returning a reference to an inner class.

public class Parcel2 {
    class Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    class Destination {
        private String label;
        Destination(String whereTo) {
            label = whereTo;
        }
        String readLabel() { return label; }
    }
    public Destination to(String s) {
        return new Destination(s);
    }
    public Contents contents() {
        return new Contents();
    }
    public void ship(String dest) {
        Contents c = contents();
        Destination d = to(dest);
        System.out.println(d.readLabel());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel2 p = new Parcel2();
        p.ship("Tasmania");
        Parcel2 q = new Parcel2();
        // Defining references to inner classes:
        Parcel2.Contents c = q.contents();
        Parcel2.Destination d = q.to("Borneo");
    }
} /* Output:
Tasmania
*///:~
```
If you want to make an object of the inner class anywhere except from within a non-static
method of the outer class, you must specify the type of that object as
OuterClassName.InnerClassName, as seen in main( ).

Exercise 1: (1) Write a class named Outer that contains an inner class named Inner.
Add a method to Outer that returns an object of type Inner. In main( ), create and
initialize a reference to an Inner.

## üçÄ12.02. The link to the outer class
So far, it appears that inner classes are just a name-hiding and code organization scheme,
which is helpful but not totally compelling. However, there's another twist. When you create
an inner class, an object of that inner class has a link to the enclosing object that made it, and
so it can access the members of that enclosing object‚Äîwithout any special qualifications. In
addition, inner classes have access rights to all the elements in the enclosing class. ¬π

¬π This is very different from the design of nested classes in C++, which is simply a 
namehiding mechanism. There is no link to an enclosing object and no implied permissions in C++.

The following example demonstrates this:

```java
//: innerclasses/Sequence.java
// Holds a sequence of Objects.

interface Selector {
    boolean end();
    Object current();
    void next();
}

public class Sequence {
    private Object[] items;
    private int next = 0;
    public Sequence(int size) { items = new Object[size]; }
    public void add(Object x) {
        if (next < items.length)
            items[next++] = x;
    }
    private class SequenceSelector implements Selector {
        private int i = 0;
        public boolean end() { return i == items.length; }
        public Object current() { return items[i]; }
        public void next() { if (i < items.length) i++; }
    }
    public Selector selector() {
        return new SequenceSelector();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sequence sequence = new Sequence(10);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            sequence.add(Integer.toString(i));
        Selector selector = sequence.selector();
        while (!selector.end()) {
            System.out.print(selector.current() + " ");
            selector.next();
        }
    }
}/* Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
*///:~
```
The Sequence is simply a fixed-sized array of Object with a class wrapped around it. You
call add( ) to add a new Object to the end of the sequence (if there's room left). To fetch
each of the objects in a Sequence, there's an interface called Selector. This is an example
of the Iterator design pattern that you shall learn more about later in the book. A Selector
allows you to see if you're at the end( ), to access the current( ) Object, and to move to the
next( ) Object in the Sequence. Because Selector is an interface, other classes can
implement the interface in their own ways, and other methods can take the interface as an
argument, in order to create more general-purpose code.

Here, the SequenceSelector is a private class that provides Selector functionality. In
main( ), you can see the creation of a Sequence, followed by the addition of a number of
String objects. Then, a Selector is produced with a call to selector( ), and this is used to
move through the Sequence and select each item.

At first, the creation of SequenceSelector looks like just another inner class. But examine
it closely. Note that each of the methods‚Äîend( ), current( ), and next( )‚Äîrefers to items,
which is a reference that isn't part of SequenceSelector, but is instead a private field in
the enclosing class. However, the inner class can access methods and fields from the
enclosing class as if it owned them. This turns out to be very convenient, as you can see in the
preceding example.

So an inner class has automatic access to the members of the enclosing class. How can this
happen? The inner class secretly captures a reference to the particular object of the enclosing
class that was responsible for creating it. Then, when you refer to a member of the enclosing
class, that reference is used to select that member. Fortunately, the compiler takes care of all
these details for you, but now you can see that an object of an inner class can be created only
in association with an object of the enclosing class (when, as you shall see, the inner class is
non-static). Construction of the inner-class object requires the reference to the object of the
enclosing class, and the compiler will complain if it cannot access that reference. Most of the
time this occurs without any intervention on the part of the programmer.

Exercise 2: (1) Create a class that holds a String, and has a toString( ) method that
displays this String. Add several instances of your new class to a Sequence object, then
display them.

Exercise 3: (1) Modify Exercise 1 so that Outer has a private String field (initialized
by the constructor), and Inner has a toString( ) that displays this field. Create an object of
type Inner and display it.

## üçÄ12.03. Using .this and .new
If you need to produce the reference to the outer-class object, you name the outer class
followed by a dot and this. The resulting reference is automatically the correct type, which is
known and checked at compile time, so there is no runtime overhead. Here's an example that
shows how to use .this:

```java
//: innerclasses/DotThis.java
// Qualifying access to the outer-class object.

public class DotThis {
    void f() { System.out.println("DotThis.f()"); }
    public class Inner {
        public DotThis outer() {
            return DotThis.this;
            // A plain "this" would be Inner's "this"
        }
    }
    public Inner inner() { return new Inner(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DotThis dt = new DotThis();
        DotThis.Inner dti = dt.inner();
        dti.outer().f();
    }
}/* Output:
DotThis.f()
*///:~
```
Sometimes you want to tell some other object to create an object of one of its inner classes.
To do this you must provide a reference to the other outer-class object in the new
expression, using the .new syntax, like this:

```java
//: innerclasses/DotNew.java
// Creating an inner class directly using the .new syntax.

public class DotNew {
    public class Inner {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DotNew dn = new DotNew();
        DotNew.Inner dni = dn.new Inner();
    }
} ///:~
```
To create an object of the inner class directly, you don't follow the same form and refer to the
outer class name DotNew as you might expect, but instead you must use an object of the
outer class to make an object of the inner class, as you can see above. This also resolves the
name scoping issues for the inner class, so you don't say (indeed, you can't say) dn.new
DotNew.Inner( ).

It's not possible to create an object of the inner class unless you already have an object of the
outer class. This is because the object of the inner class is quietly connected to the object of
the outer class that it was made from. However, if you make a nested class (a static inner
class), then it doesn't need a reference to the outer-class object.
Here, you see the use of .new applied to the "Parcel" example:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel3.java
// Using .new to create instances of inner classes.

public class Parcel3 {
    class Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    class Destination {
        private String label;
        Destination(String whereTo) { label = whereTo; }
        String readLabel() { return label; }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel3 p = new Parcel3();
        // Must use instance of outer class
        // to create an instance of the inner class:
        Parcel3.Contents c = p.new Contents();
        Parcel3.Destination d = p.new Destination("Tasmania");
    }
} ///:~
```

Exercise 4: (2) Add a method to the class Sequence.SequenceSelector that produces
the reference to the outer class Sequence.

Exercise 5: (1) Create a class with an inner class. In a separate class, make an instance of
the inner class.

## üçÄ12.04. Inner classes and upcasting
Inner classes really come into their own when you start upcasting to a base class, and in
particular to an interface. (The effect of producing an interface reference from an object that
implements it is essentially the same as upcasting to a base class.) That's because the inner
class‚Äîthe implementation of the interface‚Äîcan then be unseen and unavailable, which is
convenient for hiding the implementation. All you get back is a reference to the base class or
the interface.

We can create interfaces for the previous examples:

```java
//: innerclasses/Destination.java
public interface Destination {
    String readLabel();
} ///:~
```
Now Contents and Destination represent interfaces available to the client programmer.
Remember that an interface automatically makes all of its members public.

When you get a reference to the base class or the interface, it's possible that you can't even
find out the exact type, as shown here:

```java
//: innerclasses/TestParcel.java

class Parcel4 {
    private class PContents implements Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    protected class PDestination implements Destination {
        private String label;
        private PDestination(String whereTo) {
            label = whereTo;
        }
        public String readLabel() { return label; }
    }
    public Destination destination(String s) {
        return new PDestination(s);
    }
    public Contents contents() {
        return new PContents();
    }
}

public class TestParcel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel4 p = new Parcel4();
        Contents c = p.contents();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania");
        // Illegal -- can't access private class:
        //! Parcel4.PContents pc = p.new PContents();
    }
} ///:~
```
In Parcel4, something new has been added: The inner class PContents is private, so
nothing but Parcel4 can access it. Normal (non-inner) classes cannot be made private or
protected; they may only be given public or package access. PDestination is protected,
so nothing but Parcel4, classes in the same package (since protected also gives package
access), and the inheritors of Parcel4 can access PDestination. This means that the client
programmer has restricted knowledge and access to these members. In fact, you can't even
downcast to a private inner class (or a protected inner class unless you're an inheritor),
because you can't access the name, as you can see in class TestParcel. Thus, the private
inner class provides a way for the class designer to completely prevent any type-coding
dependencies and to completely hide details about implementation. In addition, extension of
an interface is useless from the client programmer's perspective since the client programmer
cannot access any additional methods that aren't part of the public interface. This also
provides an opportunity for the Java compiler to generate more efficient code.

Exercise 6: (2) Create an interface with at least one method, in its own package. Create a
class in a separate package. Add a protected inner class that implements the interface. In a
third package, inherit from your class and, inside a method, return an object of the
protected inner class, upcasting to the interface during the return.

Exercise 7: (2) Create a class with a private field and a private method. Create an
inner class with a method that modifies the outer-class field and calls the outer-class method.
In a second outer-class method, create an object of the inner class and call its method, then
show the effect on the outer-class object.

Exercise 8: (2) Determine whether an outer class has access to the private elements of
its inner class.

## üçÄ12.05. Inner classes in methods and scopes
What you've seen so far encompasses the typical use for inner classes. In general, the code
that you'll write and read involving inner classes will be "plain" inner classes that are simple
and easy to understand. However, the syntax for inner classes covers a number of other, 
more obscure techniques. Inner classes can be created within a method or even an arbitrary
scope. There are two reasons for doing this:
1. As shown previously, you're implementing an interface of some kind so that you can
create and return a reference.

2. You're solving a complicated problem and you want to create a class to aid in your
solution, but you don't want it publicly available.

In the following examples, the previous code will be modified to use:
1. A class defined within a method
2. A class defined within a scope inside a method
3. An anonymous class implementing an interface
4. An anonymous class extending a class that has a non-default constructor
5. An anonymous class that performs field initialization
6. An anonymous class that performs construction using instance initialization
(anonymous inner classes cannot have constructors)

The first example shows the creation of an entire class within the scope of a method (instead
of the scope of another class). This is called a local inner class:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel5.java
// Nesting a class within a method.

public class Parcel5 {
    public Destination destination(String s) {
        class PDestination implements Destination {
            private String label;
            private PDestination(String whereTo) {
                label = whereTo;
            }
            public String readLabel() { return label; }
        }
        return new PDestination(s);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel5 p = new Parcel5();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania");
    }
} ///:~
```
The class PDestination is part of destination( ) rather than being part of Parcels.
Therefore, PDestination cannot be accessed outside of destination( ). Notice the
upcasting that occurs in the return statementnothing comes out of destination( ) except a
reference to Destination, the base class. Of course, the fact that the name of the class
PDestination is placed inside destination( ) doesn't mean that PDestination is not a valid
object once destination( ) returns.

You could use the class identifier PDestination for an inner class inside each class in the
same subdirectory without a name clash.

The next example shows how you can nest an inner class within any arbitrary scope:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel6.java
// Nesting a class within a scope.

public class Parcel6 {
    private void internalTracking(boolean b) {
        if (b) {
            class TrackingSlip {
                private String id;
                TrackingSlip(String s) {
                    id = s;
                }
                String getSlip() { return id; }
            }
            TrackingSlip ts = new TrackingSlip("slip");
            String s = ts.getSlip();
        }
        // Can't use it here! Out of scope:
        //! TrackingSlip ts = new TrackingSlip("x");
    }
    public void track() { internalTracking(true); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel6 p = new Parcel6();
        p.track();
    }
} ///:~
```
The class TrackingSlip is nested inside the scope of an if statement. This does not mean
that the class is conditionally created‚Äîit gets compiled along with everything else. However,
it's not available outside the scope in which it is defined. Other than that, it looks just like an
ordinary class.

Exercise 9: (1) Create an interface with at least one method, and implement that
interface by defining an inner class within a method, which returns a reference to your
interface.

Exercise 10: (1) Repeat the previous exercise but define the inner class within a scope
within a method.

Exercise 11: (2) Create a private inner class that implements a public interface. Write
a method that returns a reference to an instance of the private inner class, upcast to the
interface. Show that the inner class is completely hidden by trying to downcast to it.

## üçÄ12.06. Anonymous inner classes
The next example looks a little odd:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel7.java
// Returning an instance of an anonymous inner class.

public class Parcel7 {
    public Contents contents() {
        return new Contents() { // Insert a class definition
            private int i = 11;
            public int value() { return i; }
        }; // Semicolon required in this case
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel7 p = new Parcel7();
        Contents c = p.contents();
    }
} ///:~
```
The contents( ) method combines the creation of the return value with the definition of the
class that represents that return value! In addition, the class is anonymous; it has no name.
To make matters a bit worse, it looks like you're starting out to create a Contents object, But
then, before you get to the semicolon, you say, "But wait, I think I'll slip in a class definition."
What this strange syntax means is "Create an object of an anonymous class that's inherited
from Contents." The reference returned by the new expression is automatically upcast to a
Contents reference. The anonymous inner-class syntax is a shorthand for:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel7b.java
// Expanded version of Parcel7.java

public class Parcel7b {
    class MyContents implements Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    public Contents contents() { return new MyContents(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel7b p = new Parcel7b();
        Contents c = p.contents();
    }
} ///:~
```
In the anonymous inner class, Contents is created by using a default constructor.
The following code shows what to do if your base class needs a constructor with an argument:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel8.java
// Calling the base-class constructor.

public class Parcel8 {
    public Wrapping wrapping(int x) {
        // Base constructor call:
        return new Wrapping(x) { // Pass constructor argument.
            public int value() {
                return super.value() * 47;
            }
        }; // Semicolon required
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel8 p = new Parcel8();
        Wrapping w = p.wrapping(10);
    }
}///:~
```
That is, you simply pass the appropriate argument to the base-class constructor, seen here as
the x passed in new Wrapping(x). Although it's an ordinary class with an implementation,
Wrapping is also being used as a common "interface" to its derived classes:

```java
//: innerclasses/Wrapping.java
public class Wrapping {
    private int i;
    public Wrapping(int x) { i = x; }
    public int value() { return i; }
} ///:~
```
You'll notice that Wrapping has a constructor that requires an argument, to make things a
bit more interesting.

The semicolon at the end of the anonymous inner class doesn't mark the end of the class
body. Instead, it marks the end of the expression that happens to contain the anonymous
class. Thus, it's identical to the use of the semicolon everywhere else.

You can also perform initialization when you define fields in an anonymous class:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel9.java
// An anonymous inner class that performs
// initialization. A briefer version of Parcel5.java.

public class Parcel9 {
    // Argument must be final to use inside
    // anonymous inner class:
    public Destination destination(final String dest) {
        return new Destination() {
            private String label = dest;
            public String readLabel() { return label; }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel9 p = new Parcel9();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania");
    }
} ///:~
```
If you're defining an anonymous inner class and want to use an object that's defined outside
the anonymous inner class, the compiler requires that the argument reference be final, as
you see in the argument to destination( ). If you forget, you'll get a compile-time error
message.

As long as you're simply assigning a field, the approach in this example is fine. But what if
you need to perform some constructor-like activity? You can't have a named constructor in
an anonymous class (since there's no name!), but with instance initialization, you can, in
effect, create a constructor for an anonymous inner class, like this:

```java
//: innerclasses/AnonymousConstructor.java
// Creating a constructor for an anonymous inner class.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

abstract class Base {
    public Base(int i) {
        print("Base constructor, i = " + i);
    }
    public abstract void f();
}

public class AnonymousConstructor {
    public static Base getBase(int i) {
        return new Base(i) { { print("Inside instance initializer"); }
            public void f() {
                print("In anonymous f()");
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base base = getBase(47);
        base.f();
    }
} /* Output:
Base constructor, i = 47
Inside instance initializer
In anonymous f()
*///:~
```
In this case, the variable i did nor have to be final. While i is passed to the base constructor of
the anonymous class, it is never directly used inside the anonymous class.

Here's the "parcel" theme with instance initialization. Note that the arguments to
destination( ) must be final since they are used within the anonymous class:

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel10.java
// Using "instance initialization" to perform
// construction on an anonymous inner class.

public class Parcel10 {
    public Destination
    destination(final String dest, final float price) {
        return new Destination() {
            private int cost;
            // Instance initialization for each object:
            {
                cost = Math.round(price);
                if (cost > 100)
                    System.out.println("Over budget!");
            }
            private String label = dest;
            public String readLabel() { return label; }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel10 p = new Parcel10();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania", 101.395 F);
    }
} /* Output:
Over budget!
*///:~
```
Inside the instance initializer you can see code that couldn't be executed as part of a field
initializer (that is, the if statement). So in effect, an instance initializer is the constructor for
an anonymous inner class. Of course, it's limited; you can't overload instance initializers, so
you can have only one of these constructors.

Anonymous inner classes are somewhat limited compared to regular inheritance, because
they can either extend a class or implement an interface, but not both. And if you do
implement an interface, you can only implement one.

Exercise 12: (1) Repeat Exercise 7 using an anonymous inner class.

Exercise 13: (1) Repeat Exercise 9 using an anonymous inner class.

Exercise 14: (1) Modify interfaces/HorrorShow.java to implement
DangerousMonster and Vampire using anonymous classes.

Exercise 15: (2) Create a class with a non-default constructor (one with arguments) and
no default constructor (no "no-arg" constructor). Create a second class that has a method
that returns a reference to an object of the first class. Create the object that you return by
making an anonymous inner class that inherits from the first class.

## üçÄ12.07. Factory Method revisited
Look at how much nicer the interfaces/Factories.java example comes out when you use
anonymous inner classes:

```java
//: innerclasses/Factories.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Service {
    void method1();
    void method2();
}

interface ServiceFactory {
    Service getService();
}

class Implementation1 implements Service {
    private Implementation1() {}
    public void method1() { print("Implementation1 method1"); }
    public void method2() { print("Implementation1 method2"); }
    public static ServiceFactory factory =
        new ServiceFactory() {
            public Service getService() {
                return new Implementation1();
            }
        };
}

class Implementation2 implements Service {
    private Implementation2() {}
    public void method1() { print("Implementation2 method1"); }
    public void method2() { print("Implementation2 method2"); }
    public static ServiceFactory factory =
        new ServiceFactory() {
            public Service getService() {
                return new Implementation2();
            }
        };
}

public class Factories {
    public static void serviceConsumer(ServiceFactory fact) {
        Service s = fact.getService();
        s.method1();
        s.method2();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        serviceConsumer(Implementation1.factory);
        // Implementations are completely interchangeable:
        serviceConsumer(Implementation2.factory);
    }
}/* Output:
Implementation1 method1
Implementation1 method2
Implementation2 method1
Implementation2 method2
*///:~
```
Now the constructors for Implementation1 and Implementation2 can be private, and
there's no need to create a named class as the factory. In addition, you often only need a single
factory object, and so here it has been created as a static field in the Service implementation.
The resulting syntax is more meaningful, as well.

The interfaces/Games.java example can also be improved with anonymous inner classes:

```java
//: innerclasses/Games.java
// Using anonymous inner classes with the Game framework.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Game { boolean move(); }
interface GameFactory { Game getGame(); }

class Checkers implements Game {
    private Checkers() {}
    private int moves = 0;
    private static final int MOVES = 3;
    public boolean move() {
        print("Checkers move " + moves);
        return ++moves != MOVES;
    }
    public static GameFactory factory = new GameFactory() {
        public Game getGame() { return new Checkers(); }
    };
}

class Chess implements Game {
    private Chess() {}
    private int moves = 0;
    private static final int MOVES = 4;
    public boolean move() {
        print("Chess move " + moves);
        return ++moves != MOVES;
    }
    public static GameFactory factory = new GameFactory() {
        public Game getGame() { return new Chess(); }
    };
}

public class Games {
    public static void playGame(GameFactory factory) {
        Game s = factory.getGame();
        while (s.move())
        ;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        playGame(Checkers.factory);
        playGame(Chess.factory);
    }
} /* Output:
Checkers move 0
Checkers move 1
Checkers move 2
Chess move 0
Chess move 1
Chess move 2
Chess move 3
*///:~
```
Remember the advice given at the end of the last chapter: Prefer classes to interfaces. If your
design demands an interface, you'll know it. Otherwise, don't put it in until you are forced to.

Exercise 16: (1) Modify the solution to Exercise 18 from the Interfaces chapter to use
anonymous inner classes.

Exercise 17: (1) Modify the solution to Exercise 19 from the Interfaces chapter to use
anonymous inner classes.

## üçÄ12.08. Nested classes
If you don't need a connection between the inner-class object and the outerclass object, then
you can make the inner class static. This is commonly called a nested class. ¬≤ To understand
the meaning of static when applied to inner classes, you must remember that the object of
an ordinary inner class implicitly keeps a reference to the object of the enclosing class that
created it. This is not true, however, when you say an inner class is static. A nested class
means:
1. You don't need an outer-class object in order to create an object of a nested class.

2. You can't access a non-static outer-class object from an object of a nested class.

Nested classes are different from ordinary inner classes in another way, as well. Fields and
methods in ordinary inner classes can only be at the outer level of a class, so ordinary inner
classes cannot have static data, static fields, or nested classes. However, nested classes can have
all of these:

¬≤ Roughly similar to nested classes in C++, except that those classes cannot access private members as they can in Java.

```java
//: innerclasses/Parcel11.java
// Nested classes (static inner classes).

public class Parcel11 {
    private static class ParcelContents implements Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    protected static class ParcelDestination
    implements Destination {
        private String label;
        private ParcelDestination(String whereTo) {
            label = whereTo;
        }
        public String readLabel() { return label; }
        // Nested classes can contain other static elements:
        public static void f() {}
        static int x = 10;
        static class AnotherLevel {
            public static void f() {}
            static int x = 10;
        }
    }
    public static Destination destination(String s) {
        return new ParcelDestination(s);
    }
    public static Contents contents() {
        return new ParcelContents();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Contents c = contents();
        Destination d = destination("Tasmania");
    }
} ///:~
```
In main( ), no object of Parcel11 is necessary; instead, you use the normal syntax for
selecting a static member to call the methods that return references to Contents and
Destination.

As you've seen earlier in this chapter, in an ordinary (non-static) inner class, the link to the
outer-class object is achieved with a special this reference. A nested class does not have a
special this reference, which makes it analogous to a static method.

Exercise 18: (1) Create a class containing a nested class. In main( ), create an instance
of the nested class.

Exercise 19: (2) Create a class containing an inner class that itself contains an inner
class. Repeat this using nested classes. Note the names of the .class files produced by the
compiler.

## üçÄ12.09. Classes inside interfaces
Normally, you can't put any code inside an interface, but a nested class can be part of an
interface. Any class you put inside an interface is automatically public and static. Since the
class is static, it doesn't violate the rules for interfaces‚Äîthe nested class is only placed inside
the namespace of the interface. You can even implement the surrounding interface in the
inner class, like this:

```java
//: innerclasses/ClassInInterface.java
// {main: ClassInInterface$Test}

public interface ClassInInterface {
    void howdy();
    class Test implements ClassInInterface {
        public void howdy() {
            System.out.println("Howdy!");
        }
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            new Test().howdy();
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Howdy!
*///:~
```
It's convenient to nest a class inside an interface when you want to create some common code
to be used with all different implementations of that interface.

Earlier in this book I suggested putting a main( ) in every class to act as a test bed for that
class. One drawback to this is the amount of extra compiled code you must carry around. If
this is a problem, you can use a nested class to hold your test code:


```java
//: innerclasses/TestBed.java
// Putting test code in a nested class.
// {main: TestBed$Tester}

public class TestBed {
    public void f() { System.out.println("f()"); }
    public static class Tester {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            TestBed t = new TestBed();
            t.f();
        }
    }
} /* Output:
f()
*///:~
```
This generates a separate class called TestBed$Tester (to run the program, you say Java
`TestBed$Tester`, but you must escape the '$' under Unix/Linux systems). You can use this
class for testing, but you don't need to include it in your shipping product; you can simply
delete TestBed$Tester.class before packaging things up.

Exercise 20: (1) Create an interface containing a nested class. Implement this interface
and create an instance of the nested class.

Exercise 21: (2) Create an interface that contains a nested class that has a static method
that calls the methods of your interface and displays the results. Implement your interface
and pass an instance of your implementation to the method.


## üçÄ12.10. Reaching outward from a multiply nested class
It doesn't matter how deeply an inner class may be nested‚Äîit can transparently access all of
the members of all the classes it is nested within, as seen here: ¬≥

¬≥ Thanks again to Martin Danner.

```java
//: innerclasses/MultiNestingAccess.java
// Nested classes can access all members of all
// levels of the classes they are nested within.

class MNA {
    private void f() {}
    class A {
        private void g() {}
        public class B {
            void h() {
                g();
                f();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class MultiNestingAccess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MNA mna = new MNA();
        MNA.A mnaa = mna.new A();
        MNA.A.B mnaab = mnaa.new B();
        mnaab.h();
    }
}///:~
```
You can see that in MNAAB, the methods g( ) and f( ) are callable without any qualification
(despite the fact that they are private). This example also demonstrates the syntax
necessary to create objects of multiply nested inner classes when you create the objects in a
different class. The ".new" syntax produces the correct scope, so you do not have to qualify
the class name in the constructor call.

## üçÄ12.11. Why inner classes?
At this point you've seen a lot of syntax and semantics describing the way inner classes work,
but this doesn't answer the question of why they exist. Why did the Java designers go to so
much trouble to add this fundamental language feature?

Typically, the inner class inherits from a class or implements an interface, and the code in the
inner class manipulates the outer-class object that it was created within. So you could say
that an inner class provides a kind of window into the outer class.

A question that cuts to the heart of inner classes is this: If I just need a reference to an
interface, why don't I just make the outer class implement that interface? The answer is "If
that's all you need, then that's how you should do it." So what is it that distinguishes an inner
class implementing an interface from an outer class implementing the same interface? The
answer is that you can't always have the convenience of interfaces‚Äîsometimes you're
working with implementations. So the most compelling reason for inner classes is:

Each inner class can independently inherit from an implementation. Thus, the inner
class is not limited by whether the outer class is already inheriting from an
implementation.

Without the ability that inner classes provide to inherit‚Äîin effect‚Äîfrom more than one
concrete or abstract class, some design and programming problems would be intractable.

So one way to look at the inner class is as the rest of the solution of the multiple-inheritance
problem. Interfaces solve part of the problem, but inner classes effectively allow "multiple
implementation inheritance." That is, inner classes effectively allow you to inherit from more
than one non-interface.

To see this in more detail, consider a situation in which you have two interfaces that must
somehow be implemented within a class. Because of the flexibility of interfaces, you have two
choices: a single class or an inner class.

```java
//: innerclasses/MultiInterfaces.java
// Two ways that a class can implement multiple interfaces.
package innerclasses;

interface A {}
interface B {}

class X implements A, B {}

class Y implements A {
    B makeB() {
        // Anonymous inner class:
        return new B() {};
    }
}

public class MultiInterfaces {
    static void takesA(A a) {}
    static void takesB(B b) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        X x = new X();
        Y y = new Y();
        takesA(x);
        takesA(y);
        takesB(x);
        takesB(y.makeB());
    }
} ///:~
```
Of course, this assumes that the structure of your code makes logical sense either way.
However, you'll ordinarily have some kind of guidance from the nature of the problem about
whether to use a single class or an inner class. But without any other constraints, the
approach in the preceding example doesn't really make much difference from an
implementation standpoint. Both of them work.

However, if you have abstract or concrete classes instead of interfaces, you are suddenly
limited to using inner classes if your class must somehow implement both of the others:

```java
//: innerclasses/MultiImplementation.java
// With concrete or abstract classes, inner
// classes are the only way to produce the effect
// of "multiple implementation inheritance."
package innerclasses;

class D {}
abstract class E {}

class Z extends D {
    E makeE() { return new E() {}; }
}

public class MultiImplementation {
    static void takesD(D d) {}
    static void takesE(E e) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Z z = new Z();
        takesD(z);
        takesE(z.makeE());
    }
}///:~
```
If you didn't need to solve the "multiple implementation inheritance" problem, you could
conceivably code around everything else without the need for inner classes. But with inner
classes you have these additional features:
1. The inner class can have multiple instances, each with its own state information that
is independent of the information in the outer-class object.

2. In a single outer class you can have several inner classes, each of which implements
the same interface or inherits from the same class in a different way. An example of
this will be shown shortly.

3. The point of creation of the inner-class object is not tied to the creation of the outer-
class object.

4. There is no potentially confusing "is-a" relationship with the inner class; it's a separate
entity.

As an example, if Sequence.java did not use inner classes, you'd have to say, "A Sequence
is a Selector," and you'd only be able to have one Selector in existence for a particular
Sequence. You can easily have a second method, reverseSelector( ), that produces a
Selector that moves backward through the sequence. This kind of flexibility is only available
with inner classes.

Exercise 22: (2) Implement reverseSelector( ) in Sequence.java.

Exercise 23: (4) Create an interface U with three methods. Create a class A with a
method that produces a reference to a U by building an anonymous inner class. Create a
second class B that contains an array of U. B should have one method that accepts and stores
a reference to a U in the array, a second method that sets a reference in the array (specified
by the method argument) to null, and a third method that moves through the array and calls
the methods in U. In main( ), create a group of A objects and a single B. Fill the B with U
references produced by the A objects. Use the B to call back into all the A objects. Remove
some of the U references from the B.

## üçÄ12.12. Closures & callbacks
A closure is a callable object that retains information from the scope in which it was created.
From this definition, you can see that an inner class is an object-oriented closure, because it
doesn't just contain each piece of information from the outer-class object ("the scope in
which it was created"), but it automatically holds a reference back to the whole outer-class
object, where it has permission to manipulate all the members, even private ones.

One of the most compelling arguments made to include some kind of pointer mechanism in
Java was to allow callbacks. With a callback, some other object is given a piece of
information that allows it to call back into the originating object at some later point. This is a
very powerful concept, as you will see later in the book. If a callback is implemented using a
pointer, however, you must rely on the programmer to behave properly and not misuse the
pointer. As you've seen by now, Java tends to be more careful than that, so pointers were not
included in the language.

The closure provided by the inner class is a good solution‚Äîmore flexible and far safer than a
pointer. Here's an example:

```java
//: innerclasses/Callbacks.java
// Using inner classes for callbacks
package innerclasses;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Incrementable {
    void increment();
}

// Very simple to just implement the interface:
class Callee1 implements Incrementable {
    private int i = 0;
    public void increment() {
        i++;
        print(i);
    }
}

class MyIncrement {
    public void increment() { print("Other operation"); }
    static void f(MyIncrement mi) { mi.increment(); }
}

// If your class must implement increment() in
// some other way, you must use an inner class:
class Callee2 extends MyIncrement {
    private int i = 0;
    public void increment() {
        super.increment();
        i++;
        print(i);
    }
    private class Closure implements Incrementable {
        public void increment() {
            // Specify outer-class method, otherwise
            // you'd get an infinite recursion:
            Callee2.this.increment();
        }
    }
    Incrementable getCallbackReference() {
        return new Closure();
    }
}

class Caller {
    private Incrementable callbackReference;
    Caller(Incrementable cbh) { callbackReference = cbh; }
    void go() { callbackReference.increment(); }
}

public class Callbacks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Callee1 c1 = new Callee1();
        Callee2 c2 = new Callee2();
        MyIncrement.f(c2);
        Caller caller1 = new Caller(c1);
        Caller caller2 = new Caller(c2.getCallbackReference());
        caller1.go();
        caller1.go();
        caller2.go();
        caller2.go();
    }
} /* Output:
Other operation
1
1
2
Other operation
2
Other operation
3
*///:~
```
This also shows a further distinction between implementing an interface in an outer class
versus doing so in an inner class. Callee1 is clearly the simpler solution in terms of the code.
Callee2 inherits from Mylncrement, which already has a different increment( ) method
that does something unrelated to the one expected by the Incrementable interface. When
Mylncrement is inherited into Callee2, increment( ) can't be overridden for use by
Incrementable, so you're forced to provide a separate implementation using an inner class.
Also note that when you create an inner class, you do not add to or modify the interface of the
outer class.

Everything except getCallbackReference( ) in Callee2 is private. To allow any
connection to the outside world, the interface Incrementable is essential. Here you can see
how interfaces allow for a complete separation of interface from implementation.
The inner class Closure implements Incrementable to provide a hook back into Callee2‚Äî
but a safe hook. Whoever gets the Incrementable reference can, of course, only call
increment( ) and has no other abilities (unlike a pointer, which would allow you to run
wild).

Caller takes an Incrementable reference in its constructor (although the capturing of the
callback reference could happen at any time) and then, sometime later, uses the reference to
"call back" into the Callee class.

The value of the callback is in its flexibility; you can dynamically decide what methods will be
called at run time. The benefit of this will become more evident in the Graphical User
Interfaces chapter, where callbacks are used everywhere to implement GUI functionality.

## üçÄ12.13. Inner classes & control frameworks
A more concrete example of the use of inner classes can be found in something that I will
refer to here as a control framework.

An application framework is a class or a set of classes that's designed to solve a particular
type of problem. To apply an application framework, you typically inherit from one or more
classes and override some of the methods. The code that you write in the overridden methods
customizes the general solution provided by that application framework in order to solve
your specific problem. This is an example of the Template Method design pattern (see
Thinking in Patterns (with Java) at www.MindView.net). The Template Method contains
the basic structure of the algorithm, and it calls one or more overrideable methods to
complete the action of that algorithm. A design pattern separates things that change from
things that stay the same, and in this case the Template Method is the part that stays the
same, and the overrideable methods are the things that change.

A control framework is a particular type of application framework dominated by the need to
respond to events. A system that primarily responds to events is called an event-driven
system. A common problem in application programming is the graphical user interface
(GUI), which is almost entirely event-driven. As you will see in the Graphical User Interfaces
chapter, the Java Swing library is a control framework that elegantly solves the GUI problem
and that heavily uses inner classes.

To see how inner classes allow the simple creation and use of control frameworks, consider a
control framework whose job is to execute events whenever those events are "ready."
Although "ready" could mean anything, in this case it will be based on clock time. What
follows is a control framework that contains no specific information about what it's
controlling. That information is supplied during inheritance, when the action( ) portion of
the algorithm is implemented.

First, here is the interface that describes any control event. It's an abstract class instead of
an actual interface because the default behavior is to perform the control based on time.
Thus, some of the implementation is included here:

```java
//: innerclasses/controller/Event.java
// The common methods for any control event.
package innerclasses.controller;

public abstract class Event {
    private long eventTime;
    protected final long delayTime;
    public Event(long delayTime) {
        this.delayTime = delayTime;
        start();
    }
    public void start() { // Allows restarting
        eventTime = System.nanoTime() + delayTime;
    }
    public boolean ready() {
        return System.nanoTime() >= eventTime;
    }
    public abstract void action();
}///:~
```
The constructor captures the time (measured from the time of creation of the object) when
you want the Event to run, and then calls start( ), which takes the current time and adds
the delay time to produce the time when the event will occur. Rather than being included in
the constructor, start( ) is a separate method. This way, you can restart the timer after the
event has run out, so the Event object can be reused. For example, if you want a repeating
event, you can simply call start( ) inside your action( ) method.

ready( ) tells you when it's time to run the action( ) method. Of course, ready( ) can be
overridden in a derived class to base the Event on something other than time.

The following file contains the actual control framework that manages and fires events. The
Event objects are held inside a container object of type List<Event> (pronounced "List of
Event"), which you'll learn more about in the Holding Your Objects chapter. For now, all you
need to know is that add( ) will append an Event to the end of the List, size( ) produces
the number of entries in the List, the foreach syntax fetches successive Events from the
List, and remove( ) removes the specified Event from the List.

```java
//: innerclasses/controller/Controller.java
// The reusable framework for control systems.
package innerclasses.controller;
import java.util.*;

public class Controller {
    // A class from java.util to hold Event objects:
    private List < Event > eventList = new ArrayList < Event > ();
    public void addEvent(Event c) { eventList.add(c); }
    public void run() {
        while (eventList.size() > 0)
            // Make a copy so you're not modifying the list
            // while you're selecting the elements in it:
            for (Event e: new ArrayList < Event > (eventList))
                if (e.ready()) {
                    System.out.println(e);
                    e.action();
                    eventList.remove(e);
                }
    }
} ///:~
```
The run( ) method loops through a copy of the eventList, hunting for an Event object
that's ready( ) to run. For each one it finds ready( ), it prints information using the object's
toString( ) method, calls the action( ) method, and then removes the Event from the list.

Note that so far in this design you know nothing about exactly what an Event does. And this
is the crux of the design‚Äîhow it "separates the things that change from the things that stay
the same." Or, to use my term, the "vector of change" is the different actions of the various
kinds of Event objects, and you express different actions by creating different Event
subclasses.

This is where inner classes come into play. They allow two things:
1. The entire implementation of a control framework is created in a single class, thereby
encapsulating everything that's unique about that implementation. Inner classes are
used to express the many different kinds of action( ) necessary to solve the problem.

2. Inner classes keep this implementation from becoming awkward, since you're able to
easily access any of the members in the outer class. Without this ability the code might
become unpleasant enough that you'd end up seeking an alternative.

Consider a particular implementation of the control framework designed to control greenhouse
functions. ‚Å¥ Each action is entirely different: turning lights, water, and thermostats on and off,
ringing bells, and restarting the system. But the control framework is designed to easily isolate
this different code. Inner classes allow you to have multiple derived versions of the same base
class, Event, within a single class. For each type of action, you inherit a new Event inner class,
and write the control code in the action( ) implementation.

As is typical with an application framework, the class GreenhouseControls is inherited from
Controller:

‚Å¥ For some reason this has always been a pleasing problem for me to solve; it came from my 
earlier book C++ Inside & Out, but Java allows a more elegant solution

```java
//: innerclasses/GreenhouseControls.java
// This produces a specific application of the
// control system, all in a single class. Inner
// classes allow you to encapsulate different
// functionality for each type of event.
import innerclasses.controller.*;

public class GreenhouseControls extends Controller {
    private boolean light = false;
    public class LightOn extends Event {
        public LightOn(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here to
            // physically turn on the light.
            light = true;
        }
        public String toString() { return "Light is on"; }
    }
    public class LightOff extends Event {
        public LightOff(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here to
            // physically turn off the light.
            light = false;
        }
        public String toString() { return "Light is off"; }
    }
    private boolean water = false;
    public class WaterOn extends Event {
        public WaterOn(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here.
            water = true;
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Greenhouse water is on";
        }
    }
    public class WaterOff extends Event {
        public WaterOff(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here.
            water = false;
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Greenhouse water is off";
        }
    }
    private String thermostat = "Day";
    public class ThermostatNight extends Event {
        public ThermostatNight(long delayTime) {
            super(delayTime);
        }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here.
            thermostat = "Night";
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Thermostat on night setting";
        }
    }
    public class ThermostatDay extends Event {
        public ThermostatDay(long delayTime) {
            super(delayTime);
        }
        public void action() {
            // Put hardware control code here.
            thermostat = "Day";
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Thermostat on day setting";
        }
    }
    // An example of an action() that inserts a
    // new one of itself into the event list:
    public class Bell extends Event {
        public Bell(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            addEvent(new Bell(delayTime));
        }
        public String toString() { return "Bing!"; }
    }
    public class Restart extends Event {
        private Event[] eventList;
        public Restart(long delayTime, Event[] eventList) {
            super(delayTime);
            this.eventList = eventList;
            for (Event e: eventList)
                addEvent(e);
        }
        public void action() {
            for (Event e: eventList) {
                e.start(); // Rerun each event
                addEvent(e);
            }
            start(); // Rerun this Event
            addEvent(this);
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Restarting system";
        }
    }
    public static class Terminate extends Event {
        public Terminate(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() { System.exit(0); }
        public String toString() { return "Terminating"; }
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that light, water, and thermostat belong to the outer class GreenhouseControls,
and yet the inner classes can access those fields without qualification or special permission.
Also, the action( ) methods usually involve some sort of hardware control.

Most of the Event classes look similar, but Bell and Restart are special. Bell rings and
then adds a new Bell object to the event list, so it will ring again later. Notice how inner
classes almost look like multiple inheritance: Bell and Restart have all the methods of
Event and also appear to have all the methods of the outer class GreenhouseControls.

Restart is given an array of Event objects that it adds to the controller. Since Restart( ) is
just another Event object, you can also add a Restart object within Restart.action( ) so
that the system regularly restarts itself.

The following class configures the system by creating a GreenhouseControls object and
adding various kinds of Event objects. This is an example of the Command design pattern‚Äî
each object in eventList is a request encapsulated as an object:

```java
//: innerclasses/GreenhouseController.java
// Configure and execute the greenhouse system.
// {Args: 5000}
import innerclasses.controller.*;

public class GreenhouseController {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreenhouseControls gc = new GreenhouseControls();
        // Instead of hard-wiring, you could parse
        // configuration information from a text file here:
        gc.addEvent(gc.new Bell(900));
        Event[] eventList = {
            gc.new ThermostatNight(0),
            gc.new LightOn(200),
            gc.new LightOff(400),
            gc.new WaterOn(600),
            gc.new WaterOff(800),
            gc.new ThermostatDay(1400)
        };
        gc.addEvent(gc.new Restart(2000, eventList));
        if (args.length == 1)
            gc.addEvent(
                new GreenhouseControls.Terminate(
                    new Integer(args[0])));
        gc.run();
    }
} /* Output:
Bing!
Thermostat on night setting
Light is on
Light is off
Greenhouse water is on
Greenhouse water is off
Thermostat on day setting
Restarting system
Terminating
*///:~
```
This class initializes the system, so it adds all the appropriate events. The Restart event is
repeatedly run, and it loads the eventList into the GreenhouseControls object each time.
If you provide a command-line argument indicating milliseconds, it will terminate the
program after that many milliseconds (this is used for testing).

Of course, it's more flexible to read the events from a file instead of hardcoding them. An

exercise in the I/O chapter asks you to modify this example to do just that.
This example should move you toward an appreciation of the value of inner classes,
especially when used within a control framework. However, in the Graphical User Interfaces
chapter you'll see how elegantly inner classes are used to describe the actions of a graphical
user interface. By the time you finish that chapter, you should be fully convinced.

Exercise 24: (2) In GreenhouseControls.java, add Event inner classes that turn
fans on and off. Configure GreenhouseController.java to use these new Event objects.

Exercise 25: (3) Inherit from GreenhouseControls in GreenhouseControls.java
to add Event inner classes that turn water mist generators on and off. Write a new version of
GreenhouseController.java to use these new Event objects.

## üçÄ12.14. Inheriting from inner classes
Because the inner-class constructor must attach to a reference of the enclosing class object,
things are slightly complicated when you inherit from an inner class. The problem is that the
"secret" reference to the enclosing class object must be initialized, and yet in the derived class
there's no longer a default object to attach to. You must use a special syntax to make the
association explicit:

```java
//: innerclasses/InheritInner.java
// Inheriting an inner class.

class WithInner {
    class Inner {}
}

public class InheritInner extends WithInner.Inner {
//! InheritInner() {} // Won't compile
    InheritInner(WithInner wi) {
        wi.super();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WithInner wi = new WithInner();
        InheritInner ii = new InheritInner(wi);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see that InheritInner is extending only the inner class, not the outer one. But when
it comes time to create a constructor, the default one is no good, and you can't just pass a
reference to an enclosing object. In addition, you must use the syntax

    enclosingClassReference.super();

inside the constructor. This provides the necessary reference, and the program will then
compile.

Exercise 26: (2) Create a class with an inner class that has a non-default constructor
(one that takes arguments). Create a second class with an inner class that inherits from the
first inner class.

## üçÄ12.15. Can inner classes be overridden?
What happens when you create an inner class, then inherit from the enclosing class and
redefine the inner class? That is, is it possible to "override" the entire inner class? This seems
like it would be a powerful concept, but "overriding" an inner class as if it were another
method of the outer class doesn't really do anything:

```java
//: innerclasses/BigEgg.java
// An inner class cannot be overriden like a method.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Egg {
    private Yolk y;
    protected class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { print("Egg.Yolk()"); }
    }
    public Egg() {
        print("New Egg()");
        y = new Yolk();
    }
}

public class BigEgg extends Egg {
    public class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { print("BigEgg.Yolk()"); }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new BigEgg();
    }
}/* Output:
New Egg()
Egg.Yolk()
*///:~
```
The default constructor is synthesized automatically by the compiler, and this calls the base-
class default constructor. You might think that since a BigEgg is being created, the
"overridden" version of Yolk would be used, but this is not the case, as you can see from the
output.

This example shows that there isn't any extra inner-class magic going on when you inherit
from the outer class. The two inner classes are completely separate entities, each in its own
namespace. However, it's still possible to explicitly inherit from the inner class:

```java
//: innerclasses/BigEgg2.java
// Proper inheritance of an inner class.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Egg2 {
    protected class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { print("Egg2.Yolk()"); }
        public void f() { print("Egg2.Yolk.f()"); }
    }
    private Yolk y = new Yolk();
    public Egg2() { print("New Egg2()"); }
    public void insertYolk(Yolk yy) { y = yy; }
    public void g() { y.f(); }
}

public class BigEgg2 extends Egg2 {
    public class Yolk extends Egg2.Yolk {
        public Yolk() { print("BigEgg2.Yolk()"); }
        public void f() { print("BigEgg2.Yolk.f()"); }
    }
    public BigEgg2() { insertYolk(new Yolk()); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Egg2 e2 = new BigEgg2();
        e2.g();
    }
}/* Output:
Egg2.Yolk()
New Egg2()
Egg2.Yolk()
BigEgg2.Yolk()
BigEgg2.Yolk.f()
*///:~
```
Now BigEgg2.Yolk explicitly extends Egg2.Yolk and overrides its methods. The method
insertYolk( ) allows BigEgg2 to upcast one of its own Yolk objects into the y reference in
Egg2, so when g( ) calls y.f( ), the overridden version of f( ) is used. The second call to
Egg2.Yolk( ) is the base-class constructor call of the BigEgg2.Yolk constructor. You can
see that the overridden version of f( ) is used when g( ) is called.

## üçÄ12.16. Local inner classes
As noted earlier, inner classes can also be created inside code blocks, typically inside the body
of a method. A local inner class cannot have an access specifier because it isn't part of the
outer class, but it does have access to the final variables in the current code block and all the
members of the enclosing class. Here's an example comparing the creation of a local inner
class with an anonymous inner class:

```java
//: innerclasses/LocalInnerClass.java
// Holds a sequence of Objects.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Counter {
    int next();
}

public class LocalInnerClass {
    private int count = 0;
    Counter getCounter(final String name) {
        // A local inner class:
        class LocalCounter implements Counter {
            public LocalCounter() {
                // Local inner class can have a constructor
                print("LocalCounter()");
            }
            public int next() {
                printnb(name); // Access local final
                return count++;
            }
        }
        return new LocalCounter();
    }
    // The same thing with an anonymous inner class:
    Counter getCounter2(final String name) {
        return new Counter() {
            // Anonymous inner class cannot have a named
            // constructor, only an instance initializer:
            {
                print("Counter()");
            }
            public int next() {
                printnb(name); // Access local final
                return count++;
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalInnerClass lic = new LocalInnerClass();
        Counter
        c1 = lic.getCounter("Local inner "),
            c2 = lic.getCounter2("Anonymous inner ");
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            print(c1.next());
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            print(c2.next());
    }
}/* Output:
LocalCounter()
Counter()
Local inner 0
Local inner 1
Local inner 2
Local inner 3
Local inner 4
Anonymous inner 5
Anonymous inner 6
Anonymous inner 7
Anonymous inner 8
Anonymous inner 9
*///:~
```
Counter returns the next value in a sequence. It is implemented as both a local class and an
anonymous inner class, both of which have the same behaviors and capabilities. Since the
name of the local inner class is not accessible outside the method, the only justification for
using a local inner class instead of an anonymous inner class is if you need a named
constructor and/or an overloaded constructor, since an anonymous inner class can only use
instance initialization.

Another reason to make a local inner class rather than an anonymous inner class is if you
need to make more than one object of that class.

## üçÄ12.17. Inner-class identifiers
Since every class produces a .class file that holds all the information about how to create
objects of this type (this information produces a "meta-class" called the Class object), you
might guess that inner classes must also produce .class files to contain the information for
their Class objects. The names of these files/classes have a strict formula: the name of the
enclosing class, followed by a '$', followed by the name of the inner class. For example, the
.class files created by LocalInnerClass.java include:

    Counter.class
    LocalInnerClass$l.class
    LocallnnerClassSlLocalCounter.class
    LocallnnerClass.class

If inner classes are anonymous, the compiler simply starts generating numbers as inner-class
identifiers. If inner classes are nested within inner classes, their names are simply appended
after a '$' and the outer-class identifier (s).

Although this scheme of generating internal names is simple and straightforward, it's also
robust and handles most situations.‚Åµ Since it is the standard naming scheme for Java, the
generated files are automatically platform-independent. (Note that the Java compiler is
changing your inner classes in all sorts of other ways in order to make them work.)

‚Åµ On the other hand, '$' is a meta-character to the Unix shell and so you'll sometimes 
have trouble when listing the .class files. This is a bit strange coming from Sun, a 
Unix-based company. My guess is that they weren't considering this issue,
but instead thought you'd naturally focus on the source-code files.

## üçÄ12.18. Summary
Interfaces and inner classes are more sophisticated concepts than what you'll find in many
OOP languages; for example, there's nothing like them in C++. Together, they solve the same
problem that C++ attempts to solve with its multiple inheritance (MI) feature. However, MI
in C++ turns out to be rather difficult to use, whereas Java interfaces and inner classes are,
by comparison, much more accessible.

Although the features themselves are reasonably straightforward, the use of these features is
a design issue, much the same as polymorphism. Over time, you'll become better at
recognizing situations where you should use an interface, or an inner class, or both. But at
this point in this book, you should at least be comfortable with the syntax and semantics. As
you see these language features in use, you'll eventually internalize them.

# üìú 13. Holding Your Objects 
It's a fairly simple program that only has a fixed quantity of objects
with known lifetimes.

In general, your programs will always be creating new objects based on some criteria that will
be known only at run time. Before then, you won't know the quantity or even the exact type
of the objects you need. To solve the general programming problem, you need to create any
number of objects, anytime, anywhere. So you can't rely on creating a named reference to
hold each one of your objects:

    MyType aReference;

since you'll never know how many of these you'll actually need.

Most languages provide some way to solve this essential problem. Java has several ways to
hold objects (or rather, references to objects). The compiler-supported type is the array,
which has been discussed before. An array is the most efficient way to hold a group of objects,
and you're pointed towards this choice if you want to hold a group of primitives. But an array
has a fixed size, and in the more general case, you won't know at the time you're writing the
program how many objects you're going to need, or whether you need a more sophisticated
way to store your objects‚Äîso the fixed-sized constraint of an array is too limiting.

The java.util library has a reasonably complete set of container classes to solve this
problem, the basic types of which are List, Set, Queue, and Map. These types of objects are
also known as collection classes, but because the Java library uses the name Collection to
refer to a particular subset of the library, I shall use the more inclusive term "container."
Containers provide sophisticated ways to hold your objects, and you can solve a surprising
number of problems by using these tools.

Among their other characteristics‚ÄîSet, for example, holds only one object of each value, and
Map is an associative array that lets you associate objects with other objects‚Äîthe Java
container classes will automatically resize themselves. So, unlike with arrays, you can put in
any number of objects and you don't need to worry about how big to make the container
while you're writing the program.

Even though they don't have direct keyword support in Java, ¬π container classes are
fundamental tools that significantly increase your programming muscle. In this chapter
you'll get a basic working knowledge of the Java container library, with an emphasis on
typical usage. Here, we'll focus on the containers that you'll use in day-to-day programming.
Later, in the Containers in Depth chapter, you'll learn about the rest of the containers and
more details about their functionality and how to use them.

¬π A number of languages, such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, have native support for containers.

## üçÄ 13.01. Generics and type-safe containers
One of the problems of using pre-Java SE5 containers was that the compiler allowed you to
insert an incorrect type into a container. For example, consider a container of Apple objects,
using the basic workhorse container, ArrayList. For now, you can think of ArrayList as
"an array that automatically expands itself." Using an ArrayList is straightforward: Create
one, insert objects using add( ), and access them with get( ), using an index‚Äîjust as you do
with an array, but without the square brackets. ¬≤ ArrayList also has a method size( ) to let
you know how many elements have been added, so that you don't inadvertently index off the
end and cause an error (by throwing a runtime exception; exceptions will be introduced in
the chapter Error Handling with Exceptions).

¬≤ This is a place where operator overloading would have been nice. C++ and C# container 
classes produce a cleaner syntax using operator overloading.

In this example, Apples and Oranges are placed into the container, then pulled out.
Normally, the Java compiler will give you a warning because the example does not use
generics. Here, a special Java SE5 annotation is used to suppress the warning. Annotations
start with an '@' sign, and can take an argument; this one is @SuppressWarnings and the
argument indicates that "unchecked" warnings only should be suppressed:

```java
//: holding/ApplesAndOrangesWithoutGenerics.java
// Simple container example (produces compiler warnings).
// {ThrowsException}
import java.util.*;

class Apple {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public long id() { return id; }
}

class Orange {}

public class ApplesAndOrangesWithoutGenerics {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList apples = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            apples.add(new Apple());
        // Not prevented from adding an Orange to apples:
        apples.add(new Orange());
        for (int i = 0; i < apples.size(); i++)
            ((Apple) apples.get(i)).id();
        // Orange is detected only at run time
    }
} /* (Execute to see output) *///:~
```
You'll learn more about Java SE5 annotations in the Annotations chapter.

The classes Apple and Orange are distinct; they have nothing in common except that they
are both Objects. (Remember that if you don't explicitly say what class you're inheriting
from, you automatically inherit from Object.) Since ArrayList holds Objects, you can not
only add Apple objects into this container using the ArrayList method add( ), but you can
also add Orange objects without complaint at either compile time or run time. When you go
to fetch out what you think are Apple objects using the ArrayList method get( ), you get
back a reference to an Object that you must cast to an Apple. Then you need to surround
the entire expression with parentheses to force the evaluation of the cast before calling the
id( ) method for Apple; otherwise, you'll get a syntax error. At run time, when you try to
cast the Orange object to an Apple, you'll get an error in the form of the aforementioned
exception. In the Generics chapter, you'll learn that creating classes using Java generics can
be complex. However, applying predefined generic classes is usually straightforward. For
example, to define an ArrayList intended to hold Apple objects, you say
ArrayList<Apple> instead of just ArrayList. The angle brackets surround the type
parameters (there may be more than one), which specify the type(s) that can be held by that
instance of the container. With generics, you're prevented, at compile time, from putting the
wrong type of object into a container. ¬≥ Here's the example again, using generics:

¬≥ At the end of the Generics chapter, you'll find a discussion about whether this is such 
a bad problem. However, the Generics chapter will also show you that Java generics are useful 
for more than just type-safe containers.

```java
//: holding/ApplesAndOrangesWithGenerics.java
import java.util.*;

public class ApplesAndOrangesWithGenerics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList < Apple > apples = new ArrayList < Apple > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            apples.add(new Apple());
        // Compile-time error:
        // apples.add(new Orange());
        for (int i = 0; i < apples.size(); i++)
            System.out.println(apples.get(i).id());
        // Using foreach:
        for (Apple c: apples)
            System.out.println(c.id());
    }
} /* Output:
0
1
2
0
1
2
*///:~
```
Now the compiler will prevent you from putting an Orange into apples, so it becomes a
compile-time error rather than a runtime error. Also notice that the cast is no longer
necessary when fetching items back out from the List. Since the List knows what type it
holds, it does the cast for you when you call get( ). Thus, with generics you not only know
that the compiler will check the type of object that you put into a container, but you also get
cleaner syntax when using the objects in the container. The example also shows that, if you
do not need to use the index of each element, you can use the foreach syntax to select each
element in the List. You are not limited to putting the exact type of object into a container
when you specify that type as a generic parameter. Upcasting works the same with generics
as it does with other types:

```java
//: holding/GenericsAndUpcasting.java
import java.util.*;

class GrannySmith extends Apple {}
class Gala extends Apple {}
class Fuji extends Apple {}
class Braeburn extends Apple {}

public class GenericsAndUpcasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList < Apple > apples = new ArrayList < Apple > ();
        apples.add(new GrannySmith());
        apples.add(new Gala());
        apples.add(new Fuji());
        apples.add(new Braeburn());
        for (Apple c: apples)
            System.out.println(c);
    }
}/* Output: (Sample)
GrannySmith@7d772e
Gala@11b86e7
Fuji@35ce36
Braeburn@757aef
*///:~
```
Thus, you can add a subtype of Apple to a container that is specified to hold Apple objects.
The output is produced from the default toString( ) method of Object, which prints the
class name followed by the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
object (generated by the hashCode( ) method). You'll learn about hash codes in detail in
Containers in Depth.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a new class called Gerbil with an int gerbilNumber that's
initialized in the constructor. Give it a method called hop( ) that displays which gerbil
number this is, and that it's hopping. Create an ArrayList and add Gerbil objects to the
List. Now use the get( ) method to move through the List and call hop( ) for each Gerbil.
Basic concepts

The Java container library takes the idea of "holding your objects" and divides it into two
distinct concepts, expressed as the basic interfaces of the library:
1. Collection: a sequence of individual elements with one or more rules applied to
them. A List must hold the elements in the way that they were inserted, a Set cannot
have duplicate elements, and a Queue produces the elements in the order
determined by a queuing discipline (usually the same order in which they are
inserted).

2. Map: a group of key-value object pairs, allowing you to look up a value using a key.
An ArrayList allows you to look up an object using a number, so in a sense it
associates numbers to objects. A map allows you to look up an object using another
object. It's also called an associative array, because it associates objects with other
objects, or a dictionary, because you look up a value object using a key object just like
you look up a definition using a word. Maps are powerful programming tools.

Although it's not always possible, ideally you'll write most of your code to talk to these
interfaces, and the only place where you'll specify the precise type you're using is at the point
of creation. So you can create a List like this:

List<Apple> apples = new ArrayList<Apple>();

Notice that the ArrayList has been upcast to a List, in contrast to the way it was handled in
the previous examples. The intent of using the interface is that if you decide you want to
change your implementation, all you need to do is change it at the point of creation, like this:

List<Apple> apples = new LinkedList<Apple>();

Thus, you'll typically make an object of a concrete class, upcast it to the corresponding
interface, and then use the interface throughout the rest of your code.

This approach won't always work, because some classes have additional functionality. For
example, LinkedList has additional methods that are not in the List interface, and a
TreeMap has methods that are not in the Map interface. If you need to use those methods,
you won't be able to upcast to the more general interface.

The Collection interface generalizes the idea of a sequence‚Äîa way of holding a group of
objects. Here's a simple example that fills a Collection (represented here with an
ArrayList) with Integer objects and then prints each element in the resulting container:

```java
//: holding/SimpleCollection.java
import java.util.*;

public class SimpleCollection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Collection < Integer > c = new ArrayList < Integer > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            c.add(i); // Autoboxing
        for (Integer i: c)
            System.out.print(i + ", ");
    }
} /* Output:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
*///:~
```
Since this example only uses Collection methods, any object of a class inherited from
Collection would work, but ArrayList is the most basic type of sequence.

The name of the add( ) method suggests that it puts a new element in the Collection.
However, the documentation carefully states that add( ) "ensures that this Collection
contains the specified element." This is to allow for the meaning of Set, which adds the
element only if it isn't already there. With an ArrayList, or any sort of List, add( ) always
means "put it in," because Lists don't care if there are duplicates.

All Collections can be traversed using the foreach syntax, as shown here. Later in this
chapter you'll learn about a more flexible concept called an Iterator.

Exercise 2: (1) Modify SimpleCollection.java to use a Set for c.

Exercise 3: (2) Modify innerclasses/Sequence.java so that you can add any number
of elements to it.

## üçÄ 13.02. Adding groups of elements
There are utility methods in both the Arrays and Collections classes in java.util that add
groups of elements to a Collection. Arrays.asList( ) takes either an array or a comma-
separated list of elements (using varargs) and turns it into a List object.

Collections.addAll( ) takes a Collection object and either an array or a comma-separated
list and adds the elements to the Collection. Here's an example that shows both methods, as
well as the more conventional addAll( ) method that's part of all Collection types:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class AddingGroups {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Collection < Integer > collection =
            new ArrayList < Integer > (Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
        Integer[] moreInts = { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
        collection.addAll(Arrays.asList(moreInts));
        // Runs significantly faster, but you can't
        // construct a Collection this way:
        Collections.addAll(collection, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15);
        Collections.addAll(collection, moreInts);
        // Produces a list "backed by" an array:
        List < Integer > list = Arrays.asList(16, 17, 18, 19, 20);
        list.set(1, 99); // OK -- modify an element
        // list.add(21); // Runtime error because the
        // underlying array cannot be resized.
    }
}//: holding/AddingGroups.java
// Adding groups of elements to Collection objects.
///:~
```
The constructor for a Collection can accept another Collection which it uses for
initializing itself, so you can use Arrays.asList( ) to produce input for the constructor.
However, Collections.addAll( ) runs much faster, and it's just as easy to construct the
Collection with no elements and then call Collections.addAll( ), so this is the preferred
approach.

The Collection.addAll( ) member method can only take an argument of another
Collection object, so it is not as flexible as Arrays.asList( ) or Collections.addAll( ),
which use variable argument lists.

It's also possible to use the output of Arrays.asList( ) directly, as a List, but the underlying
representation in this case is the array, which cannot be resized. If you try to add( ) or
delete( ) elements in such a list, that would attempt to change the size of an array, so you'll
get an "Unsupported Operation" error at run time.

A limitation of Arrays.asList( ) is that it takes a best guess about the resulting type of the
List, and doesn't pay attention to what you're assigning it to. Sometimes this can cause a
problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Snow {}
class Powder extends Snow {}
class Light extends Powder {}
class Heavy extends Powder {}
class Crusty extends Snow {}
class Slush extends Snow {}

public class AsListInference {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Snow > snow1 = Arrays.asList(
            new Crusty(), new Slush(), new Powder());

        // Won't compile:
        // List<Snow> snow2 = Arrays.asList(
        // new Light(), new Heavy());
        // Compiler says:
        // found : java.util.List<Powder>
        // required: java.util.List<Snow>

        // Collections.addAll() doesn't get confused:
        List < Snow > snow3 = new ArrayList < Snow > ();
        Collections.addAll(snow3, new Light(), new Heavy());

        // Give a hint using an
        // explicit type argument specification:
        List < Snow > snow4 = Arrays. < Snow > asList(
            new Light(), new Heavy());
    }
}//: holding/AsListInference.java
// Arrays.asList() makes its best guess about type.
 ///:~
```
When trying to create snow2, Arrays.asList( ) only has types of Powder, so it creates a
List<Powder> rather than a List<Snow>, whereas Collections.addAll( ) works fine
because it knows from the first argument what the target type is.

As you can see from the creation of snow4, it's possible to insert a "hint" in the middle of
Arrays.asList( ), to tell the compiler what the actual target type should be for the resulting
List type produced by Arrays.asList( ). This is called an explicit type argument
specification.

Maps are more complex, as you'll see, and the Java standard library does not provide any
way to automatically initialize them, except from the contents of another Map.

## üçÄ 13.03. Printing containers
You must use Arrays.toString( ) to produce a printable representation of an array, but the
containers print nicely without any help. Here's an example that also introduces you to the
basic Java containers:

```java
//: holding/PrintingContainers.java
// Containers print themselves automatically.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PrintingContainers {
    static Collection fill(Collection < String > collection) {
        collection.add("rat");
        collection.add("cat");
        collection.add("dog");
        collection.add("dog");
        return collection;
    }
    static Map fill(Map < String, String > map) {
        map.put("rat", "Fuzzy");
        map.put("cat", "Rags");
        map.put("dog", "Bosco");
        map.put("dog", "Spot");
        return map;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print(fill(new ArrayList < String > ()));
        print(fill(new LinkedList < String > ()));
        print(fill(new HashSet < String > ()));
        print(fill(new TreeSet < String > ()));
        print(fill(new LinkedHashSet < String > ()));
        print(fill(new HashMap < String, String > ()));
        print(fill(new TreeMap < String, String > ()));
        print(fill(new LinkedHashMap < String, String > ()));
    }
} /* Output:
[rat, cat, dog, dog]
[rat, cat, dog, dog]
[dog, cat, rat]
[cat, dog, rat]
[rat, cat, dog]
{dog=Spot, cat=Rags, rat=Fuzzy}
{cat=Rags, dog=Spot, rat=Fuzzy}
{rat=Fuzzy, cat=Rags, dog=Spot}
*///:~
```
This shows the two primary categories in the Java container library. The distinction is based
on the number of items that are held in each "slot" in the container. The Collection category
only holds one item in each slot. It includes the List, which holds a group of items in a
specified sequence, the Set, which only allows the addition of one identical item, and the
Queue, which only allows you to insert objects at one "end" of the container and remove
objects from the other "end" (for the purposes of this example, this is just another way of
looking at a sequence and so it is not shown). A Map holds two objects, a key and an
associated value, in each slot.

In the output, you can see that the default printing behavior (provided via each container's
toString( ) method) produces reasonably readable results. A Collection is printed
surrounded by square brackets, with each element separated by a comma. A Map is
surrounded by curly braces, with each key and value associated with an equal sign (keys on
the left, values on the right).

The first fill( ) method works with all types of Collection, each of which implements the
add( ) method to include new elements.

ArrayList and LinkedList are both types of List, and you can see from the output that
they both hold elements in the same order in which they are inserted. The difference between
the two is not only performance for certain types of operations, but also that a LinkedList
contains more operations than an ArrayList. These will be explored more fully later in this
chapter.

HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet are types of Set. The output shows that a Set will
only hold one of each identical item, but it also shows that the different Set implementations
store the elements differently. The HashSet stores elements using a rather complex
approach that will be explored in the Containers in Depth chapter‚Äîall you need to know at
this point is that this technique is the fastest way to retrieve elements, and as a result the
storage order can seem nonsensical (often, you only care whether something is a member of
the Set, not the order in which it appears). If storage order is important, you can use a
TreeSet, which keeps the objects in ascending comparison order, or a LinkedHashSet,
which keeps the objects in the order in which they were added.

A Map (also called an associative array) allows you to look up an object using a key, like a
simple database. The associated object is called a value. If you have a Map that associates
states with their capitals and you want to know the capital of Ohio, you look it up using
"Ohio" as the key‚Äîalmost as if you were indexing into an array. Because of this behavior, a
Map only accepts one of each key.

Map.put(key, value) adds a value (the thing you want) and associates it with a key (the
thing you look it up with). Map.get(key) produces the value associated with that key. The
above example only adds key-value pairs, and does not perform lookups. That will be shown
later.

Notice that you don't have to specify (or think about) the size of the Map because it resizes
itself automatically. Also, Maps know how to print themselves, showing the association with
keys and values. The order that the keys and values are held inside the Map is not the
insertion order because the HashMap implementation uses a very fast algorithm that
controls the order.

The example uses the three basic flavors of Map: HashMap, TreeMap and
LinkedHashMap. Like HashSet, HashMap provides the fastest lookup technique, and
also doesn't hold its elements in any apparent order. A TreeMap keeps the keys sorted by
ascending comparison order, and a LinkedHashMap keeps the keys in insertion order
while retaining the lookup speed of the HashMap.

Exercise 4: (3) Create a generator class that produces character names (as String
objects) from your favorite movie (you can use Snow White or Star Wars as a fallback) each
time you call next( ), and loops around to the beginning of the character list when it runs out
of names. Use this generator to fill an array, an ArrayList, a LinkedList, a HashSet, a
LinkedHashSet, and a TreeSet, then print each container.

## üçÄ 13.04. List
Lists promise to maintain elements in a particular sequence. The List interface adds a
number of methods to Collection that allow insertion and removal of elements in the
middle of a List.

There are two types of List:
‚Ä¢ The basic `ArrayList`, which excels at randomly accessing elements, but is slower
when inserting and removing elements in the middle of a List.

‚Ä¢ The `LinkedList`, which provides optimal sequential access, with inexpensive
insertions and deletions from the middle of the List. A LinkedList is relatively slow
for random access, but it has a larger feature set than the ArrayList.

The following example reaches forward in the book to use a library from the Type
Information chapter by importing typeinfo.pets. This is a library that contains a hierarchy
of Pet classes along with some tools to randomly generate Pet objects. You don't need to
know the full details at this point, just that (1) there's a Pet class and various subtypes of Pet
and (2) the static Pets.arrayList( ) method will return an ArrayList filled with randomly
selected Pet objects:

```java
//: holding/ListFeatures.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ListFeatures {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        List < Pet > pets = Pets.arrayList(7);
        print("1: " + pets);
        Hamster h = new Hamster();
        pets.add(h); // Automatically resizes
        print("2: " + pets);
        print("3: " + pets.contains(h));
        pets.remove(h); // Remove by object
        Pet p = pets.get(2);
        print("4: " + p + " " + pets.indexOf(p));
        Pet cymric = new Cymric();
        print("5: " + pets.indexOf(cymric));
        print("6: " + pets.remove(cymric));
        // Must be the exact object:
        print("7: " + pets.remove(p));
        print("8: " + pets);
        pets.add(3, new Mouse()); // Insert at an index
        print("9: " + pets);
        List < Pet > sub = pets.subList(1, 4);
        print("subList: " + sub);
        print("10: " + pets.containsAll(sub));
        Collections.sort(sub); // In-place sort
        print("sorted subList: " + sub);
        // Order is not important in containsAll():
        print("11: " + pets.containsAll(sub));
        Collections.shuffle(sub, rand); // Mix it up
        print("shuffled subList: " + sub);
        print("12: " + pets.containsAll(sub));
        List < Pet > copy = new ArrayList < Pet > (pets);
        sub = Arrays.asList(pets.get(1), pets.get(4));
        print("sub: " + sub);
        copy.retainAll(sub);
        print("13: " + copy);
        copy = new ArrayList < Pet > (pets); // Get a fresh copy
        copy.remove(2); // Remove by index
        print("14: " + copy);
        copy.removeAll(sub); // Only removes exact objects
        print("15: " + copy);
        copy.set(1, new Mouse()); // Replace an element
        print("16: " + copy);
        copy.addAll(2, sub); // Insert a list in the middle
        print("17: " + copy);
        print("18: " + pets.isEmpty());
        pets.clear(); // Remove all elements
        print("19: " + pets);
        print("20: " + pets.isEmpty());
        pets.addAll(Pets.arrayList(4));
        print("21: " + pets);
        Object[] o = pets.toArray();
        print("22: " + o[3]);
        Pet[] pa = pets.toArray(new Pet[0]);

```
The print lines are numbered so the output can be related to the source code. The first output
line shows the original List of Pets. Unlike an array, a List allows you to add elements after
it has been created, or remove elements, and it resizes itself. That's its fundamental value: a
modifiable sequence. You can see the result of adding a Hamster in output line 2‚Äîthe
object is appended to the end of the list.

You can find out whether an object is in the list using the `contains( )` method. If you want to
remove an object, you can pass that object's reference to the `remove( )` method. Also, if you
have a reference to an object, you can discover the index number where that object is located
in the List using `indexOf( )`, as you can see in output line 4.

When deciding whether an element is part of a List, discovering the index of an element, and
removing an element from a List by reference, the `equals( )` method (part of the root class
Object) is used. Each Pet is defined to be a unique object, so even though there are two
Cymrics in the list, if I create a new Cymric object and pass it to `indexOf( )`, the result will
be -1 (indicating it wasn't found), and attempts to `remove( )` the object will return false.
For other classes, `equals( )` may be defined differently‚ÄîStrings, for example, are equal if
the contents of two Strings are identical. So to prevent surprises, it's important to be aware
that List behavior changes depending on `equals( )` behavior.

In output lines 7 and 8, removing an object that exactly matches an object in the List is
shown to be successful.

It's possible to insert an element in the middle of the List, as you can see in output line 9 and
the code that precedes it, but this brings up an issue: for a LinkedList, insertion and
removal in the middle of a list is a cheap operation (except for, in this case, the actual
random access into the middle of the list), but for an ArrayList it is an expensive operation.

Does this mean you should never insert elements in the middle of an ArrayList, and switch
to a LinkedList if you do? No, it just means you should be aware of the issue, and if you
start doing many insertions in the middle of an ArrayList and your program starts slowing
down, that you might look at your List implementation as the possible culprit (the best way
to discover such a bottleneck, as you will see in the supplement at
http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava, is to use a profiler). Optimization is a tricky issue,
and the best policy is to leave it alone until you discover you need to worry about it (although
understanding the issues is always a good idea).

The `subList( )` method allows you to easily create a slice out of a larger list, and this
naturally produces a true result when passed to `containsAll( )` for that larger list. It's also
interesting to note that order is unimportant‚Äîyou can see in output lines 11 and 12 that
calling the intuitively named `Collections.sort( )` and `Collections.shuffle( )` on sub
doesn't affect the outcome of `containsAll( )`. `subList( )` produces a list backed by the
original list. Therefore, changes in the returned list are reflected in the original list, and vice
versa.

The `retainAll( )` method is effectively a "set intersection" operation, in this case keeping all
the elements in copy that are also in sub. Again, the resulting behavior depends on the
`equals( )` method.

Output line 14 shows the result of removing an element using its index number, which is
more straightforward than removing it by object reference since you don't have to worry
about `equals( )` behavior when using indexes.

The `removeAll( )` method also operates based on the `equals( )` method. As the name
implies, it removes all the objects from the List that are in the argument List. The `set( )`
method is rather unfortunately named because of the potential confusion with the Set class‚Äî
"replace" might have been a better name here, because it replaces the element at the index
(the first argument) with the second argument.

Output line 17 shows that for Lists, there's an overloaded `addAll( )` method that allows you
to insert the new list in the middle of the original list, instead of just appending it to the end
with the `addAll( )` that comes from Collection.

Output lines 18-20 show the effect of the `isEmpty( )` and `clear( )` methods.
Output lines 22 and 23 show how you can convert any Collection to an array using
`toArray( )`. This is an overloaded method; the no-argument version returns an array of
Object, but if you pass an array of the target type to the overloaded version, it will produce
an array of the type specified (assuming it passes type checking). If the argument array is too
small to hold all the objects in the List (as is the case here), to `Array( )` will create a new
array of the appropriate size. Pet objects have an `id( )` method, which you can see is called
on one of the objects in the resulting array.

Exercise 5: (3) Modify ListFeatures.java so that it uses Integers (remember
autoboxing!) instead of Pets, and explain any difference in results.

Exercise 6: (2) Modify ListFeatures.java so that it uses Strings instead of Pets, and
explain any difference in results.

Exercise 7: (3) Create a class, then make an initialized array of objects of your class. Fill
a List from your array. Create a subset of your List by using `subList( )`, then remove this
subset from your List.

## üçÄ 13.05. Iterator
In any container, you must have a way to insert elements and fetch them out again. After all,
that's the primary job of a container‚Äîto hold things. In a List, `add( )` is one way to insert
elements, and `get( )` is one way to fetch elements.

If you want to start thinking at a higher level, there's a drawback: You need to program to the
exact type of the container in order to use it. This might not seem bad at first, but what if you
write code for a List, and later on you discover that it would be convenient to apply that
same code to a Set? Or suppose you'd like to write, from the beginning, a piece of general-
purpose code that doesn't know or care what type of container it's working with, so that it can
be used on different types of containers without rewriting that code?

The concept of an Iterator (another design pattern) can be used to achieve this abstraction.
An iterator is an object whose job is to move through a sequence and select each object in
that sequence without the client programmer knowing or caring about the underlying
structure of that sequence. In addition, an iterator is usually what's called a lightweight
object: one that's cheap to create. For that reason, you'll often find seemingly strange
constraints for iterators; for example, the Java Iterator can move in only one direction.

There's not much you can do with an Iterator except:
1. Ask a Collection to hand you an Iterator using a method called `iterator( )`. That
Iterator will be ready to return the first element in the sequence.

2. Get the next object in the sequence with `next( )`.

3. See if there are any more objects in the sequence with `hasNext( )`.

4. Remove the last element returned by the iterator with `remove( )`.

To see how it works, we can again use the Pets tools from the Type Information chapter:

```java
//: holding/SimpleIteration.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class SimpleIteration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Pet > pets = Pets.arrayList(12);
        Iterator < Pet > it = pets.iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Pet p = it.next();
            System.out.print(p.id() + ":" + p + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        // A simpler approach, when possible:
        for (Pet p: pets)
            System.out.print(p.id() + ":" + p + " ");
        System.out.println();
        // An Iterator can also remove elements:
        it = pets.iterator();
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            it.next();
            it.remove();
        }
        System.out.println(pets);
    }
}/* Output:
0:Rat 1:Manx 2:Cymric 3:Mutt 4:Pug 5:Cymric 6:Pug 7:Manx 8:Cymric 9:Rat

*///:~
```
With an Iterator, you don't need to worry about the number of elements in the container.
That's taken care of for you by hasNext( ) and next( ).

If you're simply moving forward through the List and not trying to modify the List object
itself, you can see that the foreach syntax is more succinct.

An Iterator will also remove the last element produced by next( ), which means you must
call next( ) before you call remove( ). ‚Å¥

This idea of taking a container of objects and passing through it to perform an operation on
each one is powerful and will be seen throughout this book.

‚Å¥ remove( ) is a so-called "optional" method (there are other such methods), which means that 
not all Iterator implementations must implement it. This topic is covered in the Containers 
in Depth chapter. The standard Java library containers implement remove( ), however, so you 
don't need to worry about it until that chapter.
 
Now consider the creation of a display( ) method that is container-agnostic:

```java
//: holding/CrossContainerIteration.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CrossContainerIteration {

    public static void display(Iterator < Pet > it) {
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Pet p = it.next();
            System.out.print(p.id() + ":" + p + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList < Pet > pets = Pets.arrayList(8);
        LinkedList < Pet > petsLL = new LinkedList < Pet > (pets);
        HashSet < Pet > petsHS = new HashSet < Pet > (pets);
        TreeSet < Pet > petsTS = new TreeSet < Pet > (pets);
        display(pets.iterator());
        display(petsLL.iterator());
        display(petsHS.iterator());
        display(petsTS.iterator());
    }
}/* Output:
0:Rat 1:Manx 2:Cymric 3:Mutt 4:Pug 5:Cymric 6:Pug 7:Manx
0:Rat 1:Manx 2:Cymric 3:Mutt 4:Pug 5:Cymric 6:Pug 7:Manx
4:Pug 6:Pug 3:Mutt 1:Manx 5:Cymric 7:Manx 2:Cymric 0:Rat
5:Cymric 2:Cymric 7:Manx 1:Manx 3:Mutt 6:Pug 4:Pug 0:Rat
*///:~
```
Note that display( ) contains no information about the type of sequence that it is traversing,
and this shows the true power of the Iterator: the ability to separate the operation of
traversing a sequence from the underlying structure of that sequence. For this reason, we
sometimes say that iterators unify access to containers.

Exercise 8: (1) Modify Exercise l so it uses an Iterator to move through the List while
calling hop( ).

Exercise 9: (4) Modify innerclasses/Sequence.java so that Sequence works with an
Iterator instead of a Selector.

Exercise 10: (2) Change Exercise 9 in the Polymorphism chapter to use an ArrayList to
hold the Rodents and an Iterator to move through the sequence of Rodents.

Exercise 11: (2) Write a method that uses an Iterator to step through a Collection and
print the toString( ) of each object in the container. Fill all the different types of
Collections with objects and apply your method to each container.

## üçÄ 13.06. ListIterator
The ListIterator is a more powerful subtype of Iterator that is produced only by List
classes. While Iterator can only move forward, ListIterator is bidirectional. It can also
produce the indexes of the next and previous elements relative to where the iterator is
pointing in the list, and it can replace the last element that it visited using the `set( )` method.
You can produce a ListIterator that points to the beginning of the List by calling
`listIterator( )`, and you can also create a ListIterator that starts out pointing to an index n
in the list by calling listIterator(n). Here's an example that demonstrates all these abilities:

```java
//: holding/ListIteration.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ListIteration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Pet > pets = Pets.arrayList(8);
        ListIterator < Pet > it = pets.listIterator();
        while (it.hasNext())
            System.out.print(it.next() + ", " + it.nextIndex() +
                ", " + it.previousIndex() + "; ");
        System.out.println();
        // Backwards:
        while (it.hasPrevious())
            System.out.print(it.previous().id() + " ");
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println(pets);
        it = pets.listIterator(3);
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            it.next();
            it.set(Pets.randomPet());
        }
        System.out.println(pets);
    }
} /* Output:
Rat, 1, 0; Manx, 2, 1; Cymric, 3, 2; Mutt, 4, 3; Pug, 5, 4; Cymric, 6,
5; Pug, 7, 6; Manx, 8, 7;
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
[Rat, Manx, Cymric, Mutt, Pug, Cymric, Pug, Manx]
[Rat, Manx, Cymric, Cymric, Rat, EgyptianMau, Hamster, EgyptianMau]
*///:~
```
The Pets.randomPet( ) method is used to replace all the Pet objects in the List from
location 3 onward.

Exercise 12: (3) Create and populate a List<Integer>. Create a second List<Integer>
of the same size as the first, and use ListIterators to read elements from the first List and
insert them into the second in reverse order. (You may want to explore a number of different
ways to solve this problem.)

## üçÄ 13.07. LinkedList
The `LinkedList` also implements the basic `List` interface like `ArrayList` does, but it
performs certain operations (insertion and removal in the middle of the List) more
efficiently than does `ArrayList`. Conversely, it is less efficient for random-access operations.
`LinkedList` also adds methods that allow it to be used as a stack, a Queue or a double-
ended queue (deque).

Some of these methods are aliases or slight variations of each other, to produce names that
are more familiar within the context of a particular usage (Queue, in particular). For
example, `getFirst( )` and `element( )` are identical‚Äîthey return the head (first element) of
the list without removing it, and throw NoSuchElementException if the List is empty.
`peek( )` is a slight variation of those two that returns null if the list is empty.
`removeFirst( )` and `remove( )` are also identical‚Äîthey remove and return the head of the
list, and throw NoSuchElementException for an empty list, and `poll( )` is a slight
variation that returns null if this list is empty.

`addFirst( )` inserts an element at the beginning of the list.

`offer( )` is the same as `add( )` and `addLast( )`. They all add an element to the tail (end) of a
list.

`removeLast( )` removes and returns the last element of the list.
Here's an example that shows the basic similarity and differences between these features. It
doesn't repeat the behavior that was shown in ListFeatures.java:

```java
//: holding/LinkedListFeatures.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class LinkedListFeatures {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList < Pet > pets =
            new LinkedList < Pet > (Pets.arrayList(5));
        print(pets);
        // Identical:
        print("pets.getFirst(): " + pets.getFirst());
        print("pets.element(): " + pets.element());
        // Only differs in empty-list behavior:
        print("pets.peek(): " + pets.peek());
        // Identical; remove and return the first element:
        print("pets.remove(): " + pets.remove());
        print("pets.removeFirst(): " + pets.removeFirst());
        // Only differs in empty-list behavior:
        print("pets.poll(): " + pets.poll());
        print(pets);
        pets.addFirst(new Rat());
        print("After addFirst(): " + pets);
        pets.offer(Pets.randomPet());
        print("After offer(): " + pets);
        pets.add(Pets.randomPet());
        print("After add(): " + pets);
        pets.addLast(new Hamster());
        print("After addLast(): " + pets);
        print("pets.removeLast(): " + pets.removeLast());
    }
}/* Output:
[Rat, Manx, Cymric, Mutt, Pug]
pets.getFirst(): Rat
pets.element(): Rat
pets.peek(): Rat
pets.remove(): Rat
pets.removeFirst(): Manx
pets.poll(): Cymric
[Mutt, Pug]
After addFirst(): [Rat, Mutt, Pug]
After offer(): [Rat, Mutt, Pug, Cymric]
After add(): [Rat, Mutt, Pug, Cymric, Pug]
After addLast(): [Rat, Mutt, Pug, Cymric, Pug, Hamster]
pets.removeLast(): Hamster
*///:~
```
The result of Pets.arrayList( ) is handed to the LinkedList constructor in order to
populate it. If you look at the Queue interface, you'll see the element( ), offer( ), peek( ),
poll( ) and remove( ) methods that were added to LinkedList in order that it could be a
Queue implementation. Full examples of Queues will be given later in this chapter.

Exercise 13: (3) In the innerclasses/GreenhouseController.java example, the
class Controller uses an ArrayList. Change the code to use a LinkedList instead, and use
an Iterator to cycle through the set of events.

Exercise 14: (3) Create an empty LinkedList<Integer>. Using a Listlterator, add
Integers to the List by always inserting them in the middle of the List.

## üçÄ 13.08. Stack
A stack is sometimes referred to as a "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) container. It's sometimes
called a pushdown stack, because whatever you "push" on the stack last is the first item you
can "pop" off of the stack. An often-used analogy is of cafeteria trays in a spring-loaded
holder‚Äîthe last ones that go in are the first ones that come out.

LinkedList has methods that directly implement stack functionality, so you can also just
use a LinkedList rather than making a stack class. However, a stack class can sometimes
tell the story better:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Stack.java
// Making a stack from a LinkedList.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Stack<T> {
    private LinkedList<T> storage = new LinkedList<T>();
    public void push(T v) { storage.addFirst(v); }
    public T peek() { return storage.getFirst(); }
    public T pop() { return storage.removeFirst(); }
    public boolean empty() { return storage.isEmpty(); }
    public String toString() { return storage.toString(); }
} ///:~
```
This introduces the simplest possible example of a class definition using generics. The <T>
after the class name tells the compiler that this will be a parameterized type, and that the
type parameter‚Äîthe one that will be substituted with a real type when the class is used‚Äîis T.
Basically, this says, "We're defining a Stack that holds objects of type T." The Stack is
implemented using a LinkedList, and the LinkedList is also told that it is holding type T.
Notice that push( ) takes an object of type T, while peek( ) and pop( ) return an object of
type T. The peek( ) method provides you with the top element without removing it from the
top of the stack, while pop( ) removes and returns the top element.

If you want only stack behavior, inheritance is inappropriate here because it would produce a
class with all the rest of the LinkedList methods (you'll see in the Containers in Depth
chapter that this very mistake was made by the Java l.o designers when they created
java.util.Stack).

Here's a simple demonstration of this new Stack class:

```java
//: holding/StackTest.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class StackTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();
        for(String s : "My dog has fleas".split(" "))
            stack.push(s);
        while(!stack.empty())
        System.out.print(stack.pop() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
fleas has dog My
*///:~
```
If you want to use this Stack class in your own code, you'll need to fully specify the package‚Äî
or change the name of the class‚Äîwhen you create one; otherwise, you'll probably collide with
the Stack in the java.util package. For example, if we import java.util.* into the above
example, we must use package names in order to prevent collisions:

```java
//: holding/StackCollision.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class StackCollision {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        net.mindview.util.Stack<String> stack =
            new net.mindview.util.Stack<String>();
        for(String s : "My dog has fleas".split(" "))
            stack.push(s);
        while(!stack.empty())
            System.out.print(stack.pop() + " ");
        System.out.println();
        java.util.Stack<String> stack2 =
            new java.util.Stack<String>();
        for(String s : "My dog has fleas".split(" "))
            stack2.push(s);
        while(!stack2.empty())
            System.out.print(stack2.pop() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
fleas has dog My
fleas has dog My
*///:~
```
The two Stack classes have the same interface, but there is no common Stack interface in
java.util‚Äîprobably because the original, poorly designed java.util.Stack class in Java 1.0
co-opted the name. Even though java.util.Stack exists, LinkedList produces a better
Stack and so the net.mindview.util.Stack approach is preferable.

You can also control the selection of the "preferred" Stack implementation using an explicit
import:

    import net.mindview.util.Stack;

Now any reference to Stack will select the net.mindview.util version, and to select
java.util.Stack you must use full qualification.

Exercise 15: (4) Stacks are often used to evaluate expressions in programming languages.
Using net.mindview.util.Stack, evaluate the following expression, where'+' means "push
the following letter onto the stack," and'-' means "pop the top of the stack and print it":
"+U+n+c‚Äî+e+r+t‚Äî+a-+i-+n+t+y‚Äî+ -+r+u‚Äî+l+e+s‚Äî"

## üçÄ 13.09. Set
A Set refuses to hold more than one instance of each object value. If you try to add more than
one instance of an equivalent object, the Set prevents duplication. The most common use for
a Set is to test for membership, so that you can easily ask whether an object is in a Set.
Because of this, lookup is typically the most important operation for a Set, so you'll usually
choose a HashSet implementation, which is optimized for rapid lookup.

Set has the same interface as Collection, so there isn't any extra functionality like there is
in the two different types of List. Instead, the Set is exactly a Collection‚Äîit just has
different behavior. (This is the ideal use of inheritance and polymorphism: to express
different behavior.) A Set determines membership based on the "value" of an object, a more
complex topic that you will learn about in the Containers in Depth chapter.

Here's an example that uses a HashSet with Integer objects:

```java
//: holding/SetOfInteger.java
import java.util.*;

public class SetOfInteger {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        Set<Integer> intset = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
            intset.add(rand.nextInt(30));
        System.out.println(intset);
    }
} /* Output:
[15, 8, 23, 16, 7, 22, 9, 21, 6, 1, 29, 14, 24, 4, 19, 26, 11, 18, 3,
12, 27, 17, 2, 13, 28, 20, 25, 10, 5, 0]
*///:~
```
Ten thousand random numbers from o up to 29 are added to the Set, so you can imagine
that each value has many duplications. And yet you can see that only one instance of each
appears in the result.

You'll also notice that the output is in no discernible order. This is because a HashSet uses
hashing for speed‚Äîhashing is covered in the Containers in Depth chapter. The order
maintained by a HashSet is different from a TreeSet or a LinkedHashSet, since each
implementation has a different way of storing elements. TreeSet keeps elements sorted into
a red-black tree data structure, whereas HashSet uses the hashing function.

LinkedHashSet also uses hashing for lookup speed, but appears to maintain elements in
insertion order using a linked list.

If you want the results to be sorted, one approach is to use a TreeSet instead of a HashSet:

```java
//: holding/SortedSetOfInteger.java
import java.util.*;

public class SortedSetOfInteger {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        SortedSet<Integer> intset = new TreeSet<Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
            intset.add(rand.nextInt(30));
        System.out.println(intset);
    }
} /* Output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
*///:~
```
One of the most common operations you will perform is a test for set membership using
contains( ), but there are also operations that will remind you of the Venn diagrams you
may have been taught in elementary school:

```java
//: holding/SetOperations.java
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class SetOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> set1 = new HashSet<String>();
        Collections.addAll(set1,
            "A B C D E F G H I J K L".split(" "));
        set1.add("M");
        print("H: " + set1.contains("H"));
        print("N: " + set1.contains("N"));
        Set<String> set2 = new HashSet<String>();
        Collections.addAll(set2, "H I J K L".split(" "));
        print("set2 in set1: " + set1.containsAll(set2));
        set1.remove("H");
        print("set1: " + set1);
        print("set2 in set1: " + set1.containsAll(set2));
        set1.removeAll(set2);
        print("set2 removed from set1: " + set1);
        Collections.addAll(set1, "X Y Z".split(" "));
        print("'X Y Z' added to set1: " + set1);
    }
} /* Output:
H: true
N: false
set2 in set1: true
set1: [D, K, C, B, L, G, I, M, A, F, J, E]
set2 in set1: false
set2 removed from set1: [D, C, B, G, M, A, F, E]
'X Y Z' added to set1: [Z, D, C, B, G, M, A, F, Y, X, E]
*///:~
```
The method names are self-explanatory, and there are a few more that you will find in the
JDK documentation.

Producing a list of unique elements can be quite useful. For example, suppose you'd like to
list all the words in the file SetOperations.java, above. Using the
net.mindview.TextFile utility that will be introduced later in the book, you can open and
read a file into a Set:

```java

TextFile is inherited from List<String>. The TextFile constructor opens the file and
breaks it into words according to the regular expression "\\W+", which means "one or more
letters" (regular expressions are introduced in the Strings chapter). The result is handed to
the TreeSet constructor, which adds the contents of the List to itself. Since it is a TreeSet,
the result is sorted. In this case, the sorting is done lexicographically so that the uppercase
and lowercase letters are in separate groups. If you'd like to sort it alphabetically, you can
pass the String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER Comparator (a comparator is an
object that establishes order) to the TreeSet constructor:

```java
//: holding/UniqueWordsAlphabetic.java

Exercise 16: (5) Create a Set of the vowels. Working from UniqueWords.Java, count
and display the number of vowels in each input word, and also display the total number of
vowels in the input file.

## üçÄ 13.10. Map
The ability to map objects to other objects can be an immensely powerful way to solve
programming problems. For example, consider a program to examine the randomness of
Java's Random class. Ideally, Random would produce a perfect distribution of numbers,
but to test this you need to generate many random numbers and count the ones that fall in
the various ranges. A Map easily solves the problem; in this case, the key is the number
produced by Random, and the value is the number of times that number appears:

```java
//: holding/Statistics.java
// Simple demonstration of HashMap.
import java.util.*;

public class Statistics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        Map<Integer,Integer> m =
            new HashMap<Integer,Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            // Produce a number between 0 and 20:
            int r = rand.nextInt(20);
            Integer freq = m.get(r);
            m.put(r, freq == null ? 1 : freq + 1);
        }
        System.out.println(m);
    }
} /* Output:
{15=497, 4=481, 19=464, 8=468, 11=531, 16=533, 18=478, 3=508, 7=471,
12=521, 17=509, 2=489, 13=506, 9=549, 6=519, 1=502, 14=477, 10=513,
5=503, 0=481}
*///:~
```
In main( ), autoboxing converts the randomly generated int into an Integer reference that
can be used with the HashMap (you can't use primitives with containers). The get( )
method returns null if the key is not already in the container (which means that this is the
first time the number has been found). Otherwise, the get( ) method produces the associated
Integer value for the key, which is incremented (again, autoboxing simplifies the expression
but there are actually conversions to and from Integer taking place).

Here's an example that allows you to use a String description to look up Pet objects. It also
shows how you can test a Map to see if it contains a key or a value with containsKey( ) and
containsValue( ):

```java
//: holding/PetMap.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PetMap {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String,Pet> petMap = new HashMap<String,Pet>();
        petMap.put("My Cat", new Cat("Molly"));
        petMap.put("My Dog", new Dog("Ginger"));
        petMap.put("My Hamster", new Hamster("Bosco"));
        print(petMap);
        Pet dog = petMap.get("My Dog");
        print(dog);
        print(petMap.containsKey("My Dog"));
        print(petMap.containsValue(dog));
    }
} /* Output:
{My Cat=Cat Molly, My Hamster=Hamster Bosco, My Dog=Dog Ginger}
Dog Ginger
true
true
*///:~
```
Maps, like arrays and Collections, can easily be expanded to multiple dimensions; you
simply make a Map whose values are Maps (and the values of those Maps can be other
containers, even other Maps). Thus, it's quite easy to combine containers to quickly produce
powerful data structures. For example, suppose you are keeping track of people who have
multiple pets‚Äîall you need is a Map<Person, List<Pet>>:

```java
//: holding/MapOfList.java
package holding;
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class MapOfList {
    public static Map<Person, List<? extends Pet>>
        petPeople = new HashMap<Person, List<? extends Pet>>();
    static {
        petPeople.put(new Person("Dawn"),
            Arrays.asList(new Cymric("Molly"),new Mutt("Spot")));
        petPeople.put(new Person("Kate"),
            Arrays.asList(new Cat("Shackleton"),
                new Cat("Elsie May"), new Dog("Margrett")));
        petPeople.put(new Person("Marilyn"),
            Arrays.asList(
                new Pug("Louie aka Louis Snorkelstein Dupree"),
                new Cat("Stanford aka Stinky el Negro"),
                new Cat("Pinkola")));
        petPeople.put(new Person("Luke"),
            Arrays.asList(new Rat("Fuzzy"), new Rat("Fizzy")));
        petPeople.put(new Person("Isaac"),
            Arrays.asList(new Rat("Freckly")));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("People: " + petPeople.keySet());
        print("Pets: " + petPeople.values());
        for(Person person : petPeople.keySet()) {
            print(person + " has:");
            for(Pet pet : petPeople.get(person))
                print(" " + pet);
        }
    }
} /* Output:

A Map can return a Set of its keys, a Collection of its values, or a Set of its pairs. The
keySet( ) method produces a Set of all the keys in petPeople, which is used in the foreach
statement to iterate through the Map.

Exercise 17: (2) Take the Gerbil class in Exercise 1 and put it into a Map instead,
associating each Gerbil's name (e.g. "Fuzzy" or "Spot") as a String (the key) for each
Gerbil (the value) you put in the table. Get an Iterator for the keySet( ) and use it to move
through the Map, looking up the Gerbil for each key and printing out the key and telling the
Gerbil to hop( ).

Exercise 18: (3) Fill a HashMap with key-value pairs. Print the results to show
ordering by hash code. Extract the pairs, sort by key, and place the result into a
LinkedHashMap. Show that the insertion order is maintained.

Exercise 19: (2) Repeat the previous exercise with a HashSet and LinkedHashSet.

Exercise 20: (3) Modify Exercise 16 so that you keep a count of the occurrence of each
vowel.

Exercise 21: (3) Using a Map<String,Integer>, follow the form of
UniqueWords.java to create a program that counts the occurrence of words in a file. Sort
the results using Collections.sort( ) with a second argument of
String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER (to produce an alphabetic sort), and display the
result.

Exercise 22: (5) Modify the previous exercise so that it uses a class containing a String
and a count field to store each different word, and a Set of these objects to maintain the list
of words.

Exercise 23: (4) Starting with Statistics.java, create a program that runs the test
repeatedly and looks to see if any one number tends to appear more than the others in the
results.

Exercise 24: (2) Fill a LinkedHashMap with String keys and objects of your choice.
Now extract the pairs, sort them based on the keys, and reinsert them into the Map.

Exercise 25: (3) Create a Map<String,ArrayList<Integer>>. Use
net.mindview.TextFile to open a text file and read it in a word at a time (use "\\W+" as
the second argument to the TextFile constructor). Count the words as you read them in, and
for each word in the file, record in the ArrayList<Integer> the word count associated with
that word‚Äîthis is, in effect, the location in the file where that word was found.

Exercise 26: (4) Take the resulting Map from the previous exercise and re-create the
order of the words as they appeared in the original file.

## üçÄ 13.11. Queue
A queue is typically a ‚Äúfirst-in, first-out" (FIFO) container. That is, you put things in at one
end and pull them out at the other, and the order in which you put them in will be the same
order in which they come out. Queues are commonly used as a way to reliably transfer
objects from one area of a program to another. Queues are especially important in concurrent
programming, as you will see in the Concurrency chapter, because they safely transfer
objects from one task to another.

`LinkedList` has methods to support queue behavior and it implements the Queue interface,
so a `LinkedList` can be used as a `Queue` implementation. By upcasting a `LinkedList` to a
`Queue`, this example uses the Queuespecific methods in the `Queue` interface:

```java
//: holding/QueueDemo.java
// Upcasting to a Queue from a LinkedList.
import java.util.*;

public class QueueDemo {
    public static void printQ(Queue queue) {
        while (queue.peek() != null)
            System.out.print(queue.remove() + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue < Integer > queue = new LinkedList < Integer > ();
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            queue.offer(rand.nextInt(i + 10));
        printQ(queue);
        Queue < Character > qc = new LinkedList < Character > ();
        for (char c: "Brontosaurus".toCharArray())
            qc.offer(c);
        printQ(qc);
    }
}/* Output:
8 1 1 1 5 14 3 1 0 1
B r o n t o s a u r u s
*///:~
```
`offer( )` is one of the Queue-specific methods; it inserts an element at the tail of the queue if
it can, or returns false. Both `peek( )` and `element( )` return the head of the queue without
removing it, but `peek( )` returns null if the queue is empty and `element( )` throws
NoSuchElementException. Both `poll( )` and `remove( )` remove and return the head of
the queue, but `poll( )` returns null if the queue is empty, while `remove( )` throws
NoSuchElementException.

Autoboxing automatically converts the int result of nextInt( ) into the Integer object
required by queue, and the char c into the Character object required by qc. The Queue
interface narrows access to the methods of LinkedList so that only the appropriate methods
are available, and you are thus less tempted to use LinkedList methods (here, you could
actually cast queue back to a LinkedList, but you are at least discouraged from doing so).
Notice that the Queue-specific methods provide complete and standalone functionality. That
is, you can have a usable Queue without any of the methods that are in Collection, from
which it is inherited.

Exercise 27: (2) Write a class called Command that contains a String and has a
method operation( ) that displays the String. Write a second class with a method that fills
a Queue with Command objects and returns it. Pass the filled Queue to a method in a
third class that consumes the objects in the Queue and calls their operation( ) methods.

## üçÄ 13.12. PriorityQueue
First-in, first-out (FIFO) describes the most typical queuing discipline. A queuing discipline
is what decides, given a group of elements in the queue, which one goes next. First-in, first-
out says that the next element should be the one that was waiting the longest.

Apriority queue says that the element that goes next is the one with the greatest need (the
highest priority). For example, in an airport, a customer might be pulled out of a queue if
their plane is about to leave. If you build a messaging system, some messages will be more
important than others, and should be dealt with sooner, regardless of when they arrive. The
PriorityQueue was added in Java SE5 to provide an automatic implementation for this
behavior.

When you offer( ) an object onto a PriorityQueue, that object is sorted into the queue. ‚Åµ
The default sorting uses the natural order of the objects in the queue, but you can modify the
order by providing your own Comparator. The PriorityQueue ensures that when you call
peek( ), poll( ) or remove( ), the element you get will be the one with the highest priority.

‚Åµ This actually depends on the implementation. Priority queue algorithms typically sort on 
insertion (maintaining a heap), but they may also perform the selection of the most important 
element upon removal. The choice of algorithm could be important if object priority can change 
while it is waiting in the queue.

It's trivial to make a PriorityQueue that works with built-in types like Integer, String or
Character. In the following example, the first set of values are the identical random values
from the previous example, so you can see that they emerge differently from the
PriorityQueue:

```java
//: holding/PriorityQueueDemo.java
import java.util.*;

public class PriorityQueueDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PriorityQueue < Integer > priorityQueue =
            new PriorityQueue < Integer > ();
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            priorityQueue.offer(rand.nextInt(i + 10));
        QueueDemo.printQ(priorityQueue);

        List < Integer > ints = Arrays.asList(25, 22, 20,
            18, 14, 9, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 9, 14, 18, 21, 23, 25);
        priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue < Integer > (ints);
        QueueDemo.printQ(priorityQueue);
        priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue < Integer > (
            ints.size(), Collections.reverseOrder());
        priorityQueue.addAll(ints);
        QueueDemo.printQ(priorityQueue);

        String fact = "EDUCATION SHOULD ESCHEW OBFUSCATION";
        List < String > strings = Arrays.asList(fact.split(""));
        PriorityQueue < String > stringPQ =
            new PriorityQueue < String > (strings);
        QueueDemo.printQ(stringPQ);
        stringPQ = new PriorityQueue < String > (
            strings.size(), Collections.reverseOrder());
        stringPQ.addAll(strings);
        QueueDemo.printQ(stringPQ);

        Set < Character > charSet = new HashSet < Character > ();
        for (char c: fact.toCharArray())
            charSet.add(c); // Autoboxing
        PriorityQueue < Character > characterPQ =
            new PriorityQueue < Character > (charSet);
        QueueDemo.printQ(characterPQ);
    }
} /* Output:

*///:~
```
You can see that duplicates are allowed, and the lowest values have the highest priority (in
the case of String, spaces also count as values and are higher in priority than letters). To
show how you can change the ordering by providing your own Comparator object, the third
constructor call to PriorityQueue<Integer> and the second call to
PriorityQueue<String> use the reverse-order Comparator produced by
Collections.reverseOrder( ) (added in Java SE5).

The last section adds a HashSet to eliminate duplicate Characters, just to make things a
little more interesting.

Integer, String and Character work with PriorityQueue because these classes already
have natural ordering built in. If you want you use your own class in a PriorityQueue, you
must include additional functionality to produce natural ordering, or provide your own
Comparator. There's a more sophisticated example that demonstrates this in the
Containers in Depth chapter.

Exercise 28: (2) Fill a PriorityQueue (using offer( )) with Double values created
using java.util.Random, then remove the elements using poll( ) and display them.

Exercise 29: (2) Create a simple class that inherits from Object and contains no
members, and show that you cannot successfully add multiple elements of that class to a
PriorityQueue. This issue will be fully explained in the Containers in Depth chapter.

## üçÄ 13.13. Collection vs. Iterator
Collection is the root interface that describes what is common for all sequence containers.
It might be thought of as an "incidental interface," one that appeared because of
commonality between other interfaces. In addition, the java.utiLAbstractCollection class
provides a default implementation for a Collection, so that you can create a new subtype of
AbstractCollection without unnecessary code duplication.

One argument for having an interface is that it allows you to create more generic code. By
writing to an interface rather than an implementation, your code can be applied to more
types of objects. ‚Å∂ So if I write a method that takes a Collection, that method can be applied
to any type that implements Collection‚Äîand this allows a new class to choose to implement
Collection in order to be used with my method. It's interesting to note, however, that the
Standard C++ Library has no common base class for its containers‚Äîall commonality
between containers is achieved through iterators. In Java, it might seem sensible to follow
the C++ approach, and to express commonality between containers using an iterator rather
than a Collection. However, the two approaches are bound together, since implementing
Collection also means providing an iterator( ) method:

‚Å∂ Some people advocate the automatic creation of an interface for every possible combination 
of methods in a class‚Äîsometimes for every single class. I believe that an interface should 
have more meaning than a mechanical duplication of method combinations, so I tend to wait until 
I see the value added by an interface before creating one.

```java
//: holding/InterfaceVsIterator.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class InterfaceVsIterator {
    public static void display(Iterator < Pet > it) {
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Pet p = it.next();
            System.out.print(p.id() + ":" + p + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    public static void display(Collection < Pet > pets) {
        for (Pet p: pets)
            System.out.print(p.id() + ":" + p + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }

        List < Pet > petList = Pets.arrayList(8);

```
Both versions of display( ) work with Map objects as well as with subtypes of Collection,
and both the Collection interface and the Iterator decouple the display( ) methods from
knowing about the particular implementation of the underlying container.

In this case the two approaches come up even. In fact, Collection pulls ahead a bit because
it is Iterable, and so in the implementation of display(Collection) the foreach construct
can be used, which makes the code a little cleaner.

The use of Iterator becomes compelling when you implement a foreign class, one that is not
a Collection, in which it would be difficult or annoying to make it implement the
Collection interface. For example, if we create a Collection implementation by inheriting
from a class that holds Pet objects, we must implement all the Collection methods, even if
we don't need to use them within the display( ) method. Although this can easily be
accomplished by inheriting from AbstractCollection, you're forced to implement
iterator( ) anyway, along with size( ), in order to provide the methods that are not
implemented by AbstractCollection, but that are used by the other methods in
AbstractCollection:

```java
//: holding/CollectionSequence.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CollectionSequence
extends AbstractCollection < Pet > {
    private Pet[] pets = Pets.createArray(8);
    public int size() { return pets.length; }
    public Iterator < Pet > iterator() {
        return new Iterator < Pet > () {
            private int index = 0;
            public boolean hasNext() {
                return index < pets.length;
            }
            public Pet next() { return pets[index++]; }
            public void remove() { // Not implemented
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CollectionSequence c = new CollectionSequence();
        InterfaceVsIterator.display(c);
        InterfaceVsIterator.display(c.iterator());
    }

```
The remove( ) method is an "optional operation," which you will learn about in the
Containers in Depth chapter. Here, it's not necessary to implement it, and if you call it, it will
throw an exception.

From this example, you can see that if you implement Collection, you also implement
iterator( ), and just implementing iterator( ) alone requires only slightly less effort than
inheriting from AbstractCoUection. However, if your class already inherits from another
class, then you cannot also inherit from AbstractCollection. In that case, to implement
Collection you'd have to implement all the methods in the interface. In this case it would be
much easier to inherit and add the ability to create an iterator:

```java
//: holding/NonCollectionSequence.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

class PetSequence {
    protected Pet[] pets = Pets.createArray(8);
}

public class NonCollectionSequence extends PetSequence {
    public Iterator < Pet > iterator() {
        return new Iterator < Pet > () {
            private int index = 0;
            public boolean hasNext() {
                return index < pets.length;
            }
            public Pet next() { return pets[index++]; }
            public void remove() { // Not implemented
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NonCollectionSequence nc = new NonCollectionSequence();
        InterfaceVsIterator.display(nc.iterator());
    }
}/* Output:
0:Rat 1:Manx 2:Cymric 3:Mutt 4:Pug 5:Cymric 6:Pug 7:Manx
*///:~
```
Producing an Iterator is the least-coupled way of connecting a sequence to a method that
consumes that sequence, and puts far fewer constraints on the sequence class than does
implementing Collection.

Exercise 30: (5) Modify CollectionSequence.java so that it does not inherit from
AbstractCollection, but instead implements Collection.

## üçÄ 13.14. Foreach and iterators
So far, the foreach syntax has been primarily used with arrays, but it also works with any
Collection object. You've actually seen a few examples of this using ArrayList, but here's a
general proof:

```java
//: holding/ForEachCollections.java
// All collections work with foreach.
import java.util.*;

public class ForEachCollections {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Collection<String> cs = new LinkedList<String>();
        Collections.addAll(cs,
            "Take the long way home".split(" "));
        for(String s : cs)
            System.out.print("'" + s + "' ");
    }
} /* Output:
'Take' 'the' 'long' 'way' 'home'
*///:~
```
Since cs is a Collection, this code shows that working with foreach is a characteristic of all
Collection objects.

The reason that this works is that Java SE5 introduced a new interface called `Iterable` which
contains an `iterator( )` method to produce an Iterator, and the Iterable interface is what
foreach uses to move through a sequence. So if you create any class that implements
Iterable, you can use it in a foreach statement:

```java
//: holding/IterableClass.java
// Anything Iterable works with foreach.
import java.util.*;

public class IterableClass implements Iterable < String > {
    protected String[] words = ("And that is how " +
        "we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.").split(" ");
    public Iterator < String > iterator() {
        return new Iterator < String > () {
            private int index = 0;
            public boolean hasNext() {
                return index < words.length;
            }
            public String next() { return words[index++]; }
            public void remove() { // Not implemented
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (String s: new IterableClass())
            System.out.print(s + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
And that is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
*///:~
```
The iterator( ) method returns an instance of an anonymous inner implementation of
Iterator<String> which delivers each word in the array. In main( ), you can see that
IterableClass does indeed work in a foreach statement.

In Java SE5, a number of classes have been made Iterable, primarily all Collection classes
(but not Maps). For example, this code displays all the operating system environment
variables:

```java
//: holding/EnvironmentVariables.java
import java.util.*;

public class EnvironmentVariables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(Map.Entry entry: System.getenv().entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " +
            entry.getValue());
        }
    }
} /* (Execute to see output) *///:~
```
System.getenv( ) ‚Å∑ returns a Map, entrySet( ) produces a Set of Map.Entry elements,
and a Set is Iterable so it can be used in a foreach loop.

‚Å∑ This was not available before Java SE5, because it was thought to be too tightly coupled 
to the operating system, and thus to violate "write once, run anywhere." The fact that it is 
included now suggests that the Java designers are becoming more pragmatic.

A foreach statement works with an array or anything Iterable, but that doesn't mean that an
array is automatically an Iterable, nor is there any autoboxing that takes place:

```java
//: holding/ArrayIsNotIterable.java
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayIsNotIterable {
    static < T > void test(Iterable < T > ib) {
        for (T t: ib)
            System.out.print(t + " ");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
        String[] strings = { "A", "B", "C" };
        // An array works in foreach, but it's not Iterable:
        //! test(strings);
        // You must explicitly convert it to an Iterable:
        test(Arrays.asList(strings));
    }
} /* Output:
1 2 3 A B C
*///:~
```
Trying to pass an array as an Iterable argument fails. There is no automatic conversion to
an Iterable; you must do it by hand.

Exercise 31: (3) Modify polymorphism/shape/RandomShapeGenerator.java to
make it Iterable. You'll need to add a constructor that takes the number of elements that
you want the iterator to produce before stopping. Verify that it works.


## üçÄ 13.15. The Adapter Method idiom
What if you have an existing class that is Iterable, and you'd like to add one or more new
ways to use this class in a foreach statement? For example, suppose you'd like to choose
whether to iterate through a list of words in either a forward or reverse direction. If you
simply inherit from the class and override the iterator( ) method, you replace the existing
method and you don't get a choice.

One solution is what I call the Adapter Method idiom. The "Adapter" part comes from design
patterns, because you must provide a particular interface to satisfy the foreach statement.
When you have one interface and you need another one, writing an adapter solves the
problem. Here, I want to add the ability to produce a reverse iterator to the default forward
iterator, so I can't override. Instead, I add a method that produces an Iterable object which
can then be used in the foreach statement. As you see here, this allows us to provide multiple
ways to use foreach:

```java
//: holding/AdapterMethodIdiom.java
// The "Adapter Method" idiom allows you to use foreach
// with additional kinds of Iterables.
import java.util.*;

class ReversibleArrayList < T > extends ArrayList < T > {
    public ReversibleArrayList(Collection < T > c) { super(c); }
    public Iterable < T > reversed() {
        return new Iterable < T > () {
            public Iterator < T > iterator() {
                return new Iterator < T > () {
                    int current = size() - 1;
                    public boolean hasNext() { return current > -1; }
                    public T next() { return get(current--); }
                    public void remove() { // Not implemented
                        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
                    }
                };
            }
        };
    }
}

public class AdapterMethodIdiom {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReversibleArrayList < String > ral =
            new ReversibleArrayList < String > (
                Arrays.asList("To be or not to be".split(" ")));
        // Grabs the ordinary iterator via iterator():
        for (String s: ral)
            System.out.print(s + " ");
        System.out.println();
        // Hand it the Iterable of your choice
        for (String s: ral.reversed())
            System.out.print(s + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
To be or not to be
be to not or be To
*///:~
```
If you simply put the ral object in the foreach statement, you get the (default) forward
iterator. But if you call reversed( ) on the object, it produces different behavior.
Using this approach, I can add two adapter methods to the IterableClass.java example:

```java
//: holding/MultiIterableClass.java
// Adding several Adapter Methods.
import java.util.*;

public class MultiIterableClass extends IterableClass {
    public Iterable < String > reversed() {
        return new Iterable < String > () {
            public Iterator < String > iterator() {
                return new Iterator < String > () {
                    int current = words.length - 1;
                    public boolean hasNext() { return current > -1; }
                    public String next() { return words[current--]; }
                    public void remove() { // Not implemented
                        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
                    }
                };
            }
        };
    }
    public Iterable < String > randomized() {
        return new Iterable < String > () {
            public Iterator < String > iterator() {
                List < String > shuffled =
                    new ArrayList < String > (Arrays.asList(words));
                Collections.shuffle(shuffled, new Random(47));
                return shuffled.iterator();
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MultiIterableClass mic = new MultiIterableClass();
        for (String s: mic.reversed())
            System.out.print(s + " ");
        System.out.println();
        for (String s: mic.randomized())
            System.out.print(s + " ");
        System.out.println();
        for (String s: mic)
            System.out.print(s + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
banana-shaped. be to Earth the know we how is that And
is banana-shaped. Earth that how the be And we know to
And that is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
*///:~
```
Notice that the second method, random( ), doesn't create its own Iterator but simply
returns the one from the shuffled List.

You can see from the output that the Collections.shuffle( ) method doesn't affect the
original array, but only shuffles the references in shuffled. This is only true because the
randomized( ) method wraps an ArrayList around the result of Arrays.asList( ). If the
List produced by Arrays.asList( ) is shuffled directly, it will modify the underlying array, as
you can see here:

```java
//: holding/ModifyingArraysAsList.java
import java.util.*;

public class ModifyingArraysAsList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        Integer[] ia = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
        List < Integer > list1 =
            new ArrayList < Integer > (Arrays.asList(ia));
        System.out.println("Before shuffling: " + list1);
        Collections.shuffle(list1, rand);
        System.out.println("After shuffling: " + list1);
        System.out.println("array: " + Arrays.toString(ia));

        List < Integer > list2 = Arrays.asList(ia);
        System.out.println("Before shuffling: " + list2);
        Collections.shuffle(list2, rand);
        System.out.println("After shuffling: " + list2);
        System.out.println("array: " + Arrays.toString(ia));
    }
} /* Output:
Before shuffling: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After shuffling: [4, 6, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 5, 10, 9]
array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Before shuffling: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After shuffling: [9, 1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 10, 4, 8]
array: [9, 1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 10, 4, 8]
*///:~
```
In the first case, the output of Arrays.asList( ) is handed to the ArrayList( ) constructor,
and this creates an ArrayList that references the elements of ia. Shuffling these references
doesn't modify the array. However, if you use the result of Arrays.asList(ia) directly,
shuffling modifies the order of ia. It's important to be aware that Arrays.asList( ) produces
a List object that uses the underlying array as its physical implementation. If you do
anything to that List that modifies it, and you don't want the original array modified, you
should make a copy into another container.

Exercise 32: (2) Following the example of MultilterableClass, add reversed( ) and
randomized( ) methods to NonCollectionSequence.java, as well as making
NonCollectionSequence implement Iterable, and show that all the approaches work in
foreach statements.

## üçÄ 13.16. Summary
Java provides a number of ways to hold objects:
1. An array associates numerical indexes to objects. It holds objects of a known type so
that you don't have to cast the result when you're looking up an object. It can be
multidimensional, and it can hold primitives. However, its size cannot be changed
once you create it.

2. A Collection holds single elements, and a Map holds associated pairs. With Java
generics, you specify the type of object to be held in the containers, so you can't put
the wrong type into a container and you don't have to cast elements when you fetch
them out of a container. Both Collections and Maps automatically resize themselves
as you add more elements. A container won't hold primitives, but autoboxing takes
care of translating primitives back and forth to the wrapper types held in the
container.

3. Like an array, a List also associates numerical indexes to objects‚Äî thus, arrays and
Lists are ordered containers.

4. Use an ArrayList if you're doing a lot of random accesses, but a LinkedList if you
will be doing a lot of insertions and removals in the middle of the list.

5. The behavior of Queues and stacks is provided via the LinkedList.

6. A Map is a way to associate not integral values, but objects with other objects.
HashMaps are designed for rapid access, whereas a TreeMap keeps its keys in
sorted order, and thus is not as fast as a HashMap. A LinkedHashMap keeps its
elements in insertion order, but provides rapid access with hashing.

7. A Set only accepts one of each type of object. HashSets provide maximally fast
lookups, whereas TreeSets keep the elements in sorted order. LinkedHashSets
keep elements in insertion order.

8. There's no need to use the legacy classes Vector, Hashtable, and Stack in new
code.

It's helpful to look at a simplified diagram of the Java containers (without the abstract classes
or legacy components). This only includes the interfaces and classes that you will encounter
on a regular basis.

Simple Container Taxonomy
https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/thinking_in_java/TIJ325.png

You'll see that there are really only four basic container components‚ÄîMap, List, Set, and
Queue‚Äîand only two or three implementations of each one (the java.util.concurrent
implementations of Queue are not included in this diagram). The containers that you will
use most often have heavy black lines around them.

The dotted boxes represent interfaces, and the solid boxes are regular (concrete) classes.
The dotted lines with hollow arrows indicate that a particular class is implementing an
interface. The solid arrows show that a class can produce objects of the class the arrow is
pointing to. For example, any Collection can produce an Iterator, and a List can produce
a ListIterator (as well as an ordinary Iterator, since List is inherited from Collection).
Here's an example that shows the difference in methods between the various classes. The
actual code is from the Generics chapter; I'm just calling it here to produce the output. The
output also shows the interfaces that are implemented in each class or interface:

```java
//: holding/ContainerMethods.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class ContainerMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ContainerMethodDifferences.main(args);
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)

Interfaces in TreeMap: [NavigableMap, Cloneable, Serializable]
*///:~
```
You can see that all Sets except TreeSet have exactly the same interface as Collection. List
and Collection differ significantly, although List requires methods that are in Collection.
On the other hand, the methods in the Queue interface stand alone; the Collection
methods are not required to create a functioning Queue implementation. Finally, the only
intersection between Map and Collection is the fact that a Map can produce Collections
using the entrySet( ) and values( ) methods.

Notice the tagging interface java.util.RandomAccess, which is attached to ArrayList but
not to LinkedList. This provides information for algorithms that might want to dynamically
change their behavior depending on the use of a particular List.

It's true that this organization is somewhat odd, as object-oriented hierarchies go. However,
as you learn more about the containers in java.util (in particular, in the Containers in Depth
chapter), you'll see that there are more issues than just a slightly odd inheritance structure.
Container libraries have always been difficult design problems‚Äîsolving these problems
involves satisfying a set of forces that often oppose each other. So you should be prepared for
some compromises here and there. Despite these issues, the Java containers are fundamental
tools that you can use on a day-to-day basis to make your programs simpler, more powerful,
and more effective. It might take you a little while to get comfortable with some aspects of the
library, but I think you'll find yourself rapidly acquiring and using the classes in this library.

# üìú 14. Error Handling with Exceptions
The basic philosophy of Java is that "badly formed code will not be run."
The ideal time to catch an error is at compile time, before you even try to run the program.
However, not all errors can be detected at compile time. The rest of the problems must be
handled at run time through some formality that allows the originator of the error to pass
appropriate information to a recipient who will know how to handle the difficulty properly.
Improved error recovery is one of the most powerful ways that you can increase the
robustness of your code. Error recovery is a fundamental concern for every program you
write, but it's especially important in Java, where one of the primary goals is to create
program components for others to use. To create a robust system, each component must be
robust. By providing a consistent error-reporting model using exceptions, Java allows
components to reliably communicate problems to client code.

The goals for exception handling in Java are to simplify the creation of large, reliable
programs using less code than currently possible, and to do so with more confidence that
your application doesn't have an unhandled error. Exceptions are not terribly difficult to
learn, and are one of those features that provide immediate and significant benefits to your
project.

Because exception handling is the only official way that Java reports errors, and it is enforced
by the Java compiler, there are only so many examples that can be written in this book
without learning about exception handling. This chapter introduces you to the code that you
need to write to properly handle exceptions, and shows how you can generate your own
exceptions if one of your methods gets into trouble.

## üçÄ14.01. Concepts
C and other earlier languages often had multiple error-handling schemes, and these were
generally established by convention and not as part of the programming language. Typically,
you returned a special value or set a flag, and the recipient was supposed to look at the value
or the flag and determine that something was amiss. However, as the years passed, it was
discovered that programmers who use a library tend to think of themselves as invincible‚Äîas
in "Yes, errors might happen to others, but not in my code." So, not too surprisingly, they
wouldn't check for the error conditions (and sometimes the error conditions were too silly to
check for ¬π ). If you were thorough enough to check for an error every time you called a
method, your code could turn into an unreadable nightmare. Because programmers could
still coax systems out of these languages, they were resistant to admitting the truth: that this
approach to handling errors was a major limitation to creating large, robust, maintainable
programs.

¬π The C programmer can look up the return value of printf( ) for an example of this.

The solution is to take the casual nature out of error handling and to enforce formality. This
actually has a long history, because implementations of exception handling go back to
operating systems in the 1960s, and even to BASIC'S "on error goto." But C++ exception
handling was based on Ada, and Java's is based primarily on C++ (although it looks more
like Object Pascal).

The word "exception" is meant in the sense of "I take exception to that." At the point where
the problem occurs, you might not know what to do with it, but you do know that you can't
just continue on merrily; you must stop, and somebody, somewhere, must figure out what to
do. But you don't have enough information in the current context to fix the problem. So you
hand the problem out to a higher context where someone is qualified to make the proper
decision.

The other rather significant benefit of exceptions is that they tend to reduce the complexity of
error-handling code. Without exceptions, you must check for a particular error and deal with
it at multiple places in your program. With exceptions, you no longer need to check for errors
at the point of the method call, since the exception will guarantee that someone catches it.
You only need to handle the problem in one place, in the so-called exception handler. This
saves you code, and it separates the code that describes what you want to do during normal
execution from the code that is executed when things go awry. In general, reading, writing,
and debugging code becomes much clearer with exceptions than when using the old way of
error handling.

## üçÄ14.02. Basic exceptions
An exceptional condition is a problem that prevents the continuation of the current method
or scope. It's important to distinguish an exceptional condition from a normal problem, in
which you have enough information in the current context to somehow cope with the
difficulty. With an exceptional condition, you cannot continue processing because you don't
have the information necessary to deal with the problem in the current context. All you can
do is jump out of the current context and relegate that problem to a higher context. This is
what happens when you throw an exception.

Division is a simple example. If you're about to divide by zero, it's worth checking for that
condition. But what does it mean that the denominator is zero? Maybe you know, in the
context of the problem you're trying to solve in that particular method, how to deal with a
zero denominator. But if it's an unexpected value, you can't deal with it and so must throw an
exception rather than continuing along that execution path.

When you throw an exception, several things happen. First, the exception object is created in
the same way that any Java object is created: on the heap, with new. Then the current path
of execution (the one you couldn't continue) is stopped and the reference for the exception
object is ejected from the current context. At this point the exception-handling mechanism
takes over and begins to look for an appropriate place to continue executing the program.
This appropriate place is the exception handler, whose job is to recover from the problem so
the program can either try another tack or just continue.

As a simple example of throwing an exception, consider an object reference called t. It's
possible that you might be passed a reference that hasn't been initialized, so you might want
to check before trying to call a method using that object reference. You can send information
about the error into a larger context by creating an object representing your information and
"throwing" it out of your current context. This is called throwing an exception. Here's what it
looks like:

    if(t == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();

This throws the exception, which allows you‚Äîin the current context‚Äîto abdicate
responsibility for thinking about the issue further. It's just magically handled somewhere
else. Precisely where will be shown shortly.

Exceptions allow you to think of everything that you do as a transaction, and the exceptions
guard those transactions: "...the fundamental premise of transactions is that we needed
exception handling in distributed computations. Transactions are the computer equivalent of
contract law. If anything goes wrong, we'll just blow away the whole computation." ¬≤ You can
also think about exceptions as a built-in undo system, because (with some care) you can have
various recovery points in your program. If a part of the program fails, the exception will
"undo" back to a known stable point in the program.

¬≤ Jim Gray, Turing Award winner for his team's contributions on transactions, in an interview on www.acmqueue.org.

One of the most important aspects of exceptions is that if something bad happens, they don't
allow a program to continue along its ordinary path. This has been a real problem in
languages like C and C++; especially C, which had no way to force a program to stop going
down a path if a problem occurred, so it was possible to ignore problems for a long time and
get into a completely inappropriate state. Exceptions allow you to (if nothing else) force the
program to stop and tell you what went wrong, or (ideally) force the program to deal with the
problem and return to a stable state.

## üçÄ14.03. Exception arguments
As with any object in Java, you always create exceptions on the heap using new, which
allocates storage and calls a constructor. There are two constructors in all standard
exceptions: The first is the default constructor, and the second takes a string argument so
that you can place pertinent information in the exception:

    throw new NullPointerException("t = null");

This string can later be extracted using various methods, as you'll see.
The keyword throw produces a number of interesting results. After creating an exception
object with new, you give the resulting reference to throw. The object is, in effect,
"returned" from the method, even though that object type isn't normally what the method is
designed to return. A simplistic way to think about exception handling is as a different kind
of return mechanism, although you get into trouble if you take that analogy too far. You can
also exit from ordinary scopes by throwing an exception. In either case, an exception object is
returned, and the method or scope exits.

Any similarity to an ordinary return from a method ends here, because where you return is
someplace completely different from where you return for a normal method call. (You end up
in an appropriate exception handler that might be far away‚Äîmany levels on the call stack‚Äî
from where the exception was thrown.)

In addition, you can throw any type of Throwable, which is the exception root class.
Typically, you'll throw a different class of exception for each different type of error. The
information about the error is represented both inside the exception object and implicitly in
the name of the exception class, so someone in the bigger context can figure out what to do
with your exception. (Often, the only information is the type of exception, and nothing
meaningful is stored within the exception object.)

## üçÄ14.04. Catching an exception
To see how an exception is caught, you must first understand the concept of a guarded
region. This is a section of code that might produce exceptions and is followed by the code to
handle those exceptions.



## üçÄ14.05. The try block
If you're inside a method and you throw an exception (or another method that you call within
this method throws an exception), that method will exit in the process of throwing. If you
don't want a throw to exit the method, you can set up a special block within that method to
capture the exception. This is called the try block because you "try" your various method calls
there. The try block is an ordinary scope preceded by the keyword try:

    try {
    // Code that might generate exceptions
    }

If you were checking for errors carefully in a programming language that didn't support
exception handling, you'd have to surround every method call with setup and error-testing
code, even if you call the same method several times. With exception handling, you put
everything in a try block and capture all the exceptions in one place. This means your code is
much easier to write and read because the goal of the code is not confused with the error
checking.

## üçÄ14.06. Exception handlers
Of course, the thrown exception must end up someplace. This "place" is the exception
handler, and there's one for every exception type you want to catch. Exception handlers
immediately follow the try block and are denoted by the keyword catch:

    try {
        // Code that might generate exceptions
    } catch(Type1 id1)|{
        // Handle exceptions of Type1
    } catch(Type2 id2) {
        // Handle exceptions of Type2
    } catch(Type3 id3) {
        // Handle exceptions of Type3
    }

    // etc...

Each catch clause (exception handler) is like a little method that takes one and only one
argument of a particular type. The identifier (id1, id2, and so on) can be used inside the
handler, just like a method argument. Sometimes you never use the identifier because the
type of the exception gives you enough information to deal with the exception, but the
identifier must still be there.

The handlers must appear directly after the try block. If an exception is thrown, the
exception-handling mechanism goes hunting for the first handler with an argument that
matches the type of the exception. Then it enters that catch clause, and the exception is
considered handled. The search for handlers stops once the catch clause is finished. Only the
matching catch clause executes; it's not like a switch statement in which you need a break
after each case to prevent the remaining ones from executing. Note that within the try
block, a number of different method calls might generate the same exception, but you need
only one handler.

## üçÄ14.07. Termination vs. resumption
There are two basic models in exception-handling theory. Java supportst termination, ¬≥ in
which you assume that the error is so critical that there's no way to get back to where the
exception occurred. Whoever threw the exception decided that there was no way to salvage
the situation, and they don't want to come back.

¬≥ As do most languages, including C++, C#, Python, D, etc.

The alternative is called resumption. It means that the exception handler is expected to do
something to rectify the situation, and then the faulting method is retried, presuming success
the second time. If you want resumption, it means you still hope to continue execution after
the exception is handled.

If you want resumption-like behavior in Java, don't throw an exception when you encounter
an error. Instead, call a method that fixes the problem. Alternatively, place your try block
inside a while loop that keeps reentering the try block until the result is satisfactory.

Historically, programmers using operating systems that supported resumptive exception
handling eventually ended up using termination-like code and skipping resumption. So
although resumption sounds attractive at first, it isn't quite so useful in practice. The
dominant reason is probably the coupling that results: A resumptive handler would need to
be aware of where the exception is thrown, and contain non-generic code specific to the
throwing location. This makes the code difficult to write and maintain, especially for large
systems where the exception can be generated from many points.

## üçÄ14.08. Creating your own exceptions
You're not stuck using the existing Java exceptions. The Java exception hierarchy can't
foresee all the errors you might want to report, so you can create your own to denote a special
problem that your library might encounter.

To create your own exception class, you must inherit from an existing exception class,
preferably one that is close in meaning to your new exception (although this is often not
possible). The most trivial way to create a new type of exception is just to let the compiler
create the default constructor for you, so it requires almost no code at all:

```java
//: exceptions/InheritingExceptions.java
// Creating your own exceptions.

class SimpleException extends Exception {}

public class InheritingExceptions {
    public void f() throws SimpleException {
        System.out.println("Throw SimpleException from f()");
        throw new SimpleException();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InheritingExceptions sed = new InheritingExceptions();
        try {
            sed.f();
        } catch (SimpleException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught it!");
        }
    }
}/* Output:
Throw SimpleException from f()

Caught it!
*///:~
```
The compiler creates a default constructor, which automatically (and invisibly) calls the base-
class default constructor. Of course, in this case you don't get a SimpleException(String)
constructor, but in practice that isn't used much. As you'll see, the most important thing
about an exception is the class name, so most of the time an exception like the one shown
here is satisfactory.

Here, the result is printed to the console, where it is automatically captured and tested with
this book's output-display system. However, you may want to send error output to the
standard error stream by writing to System.err. This is usually a better place to send error
information than System.out, which may be redirected. If you send output to System.err,
it will not be redirected along with System.out so the user is more likely to notice it. You
can also create an exception class that has a constructor with a String argument:

```java
//: exceptions/FullConstructors.java

class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException() {}
    public MyException(String msg) { super(msg); }
}

public class FullConstructors {
    public static void f() throws MyException {
        System.out.println("Throwing MyException from f()");
        throw new MyException();
    }
    public static void g() throws MyException {
        System.out.println("Throwing MyException from g()");
        throw new MyException("Originated in g()");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            f();
        } catch (MyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
        try {
            g();
        } catch (MyException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
    }
}/* Output:
Throwing MyException from f()
MyException
at FullConstructors.f(FullConstructors.java:11)
at FullConstructors.main(FullConstructors.java:19)
Throwing MyException from g()
MyException: Originated in g()
at FullConstructors.g(FullConstructors.java:15)
at FullConstructors.main(FullConstructors.java:24)
*///:~
```
The added code is small: two constructors that define the way MyException is created. In
the second constructor, the base-class constructor with a String argument is explicitly
invoked by using the super keyword.

In the handlers, one of the Throwable (from which Exception is inherited) methods is
called: printStackTrace( ). As you can see from the output, this produces information

about the sequence of methods that were called to get to the point where the exception
happened. Here, the information is sent to System.out, and automatically captured and
displayed in the output. However, if you call the default version:

    e.printStackTrace();

the information goes to the standard error stream.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a class with a main( ) that throws an object of class Exception
inside a try block. Give the constructor for Exception a String argument. Catch the
exception inside a catch clause and print the String argument. Add a finally clause and
print a message to prove you were there.

Exercise 2: (1) Define an object reference and initialize it to null. Try to call a method
through this reference. Now wrap the code in a try-catch clause to catch the exception.

Exercise 3: (1) Write code to generate and catch an
ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException.

Exercise 4: (2) Create your own exception class using the extends keyword. Write a
constructor for this class that takes a String argument and stores it inside the object with a
String reference. Write a method that displays the stored String. Create a try-catch clause
to exercise your new exception.

Exercise 5: (3) Create your own resumption-like behavior using a while loop that
repeats until an exception is no longer thrown.

## üçÄ14.09. Exceptions and logging
You may also want to log the output using the java.util.logging facility. Although full
details of logging are introduced in the supplement at
http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava, basic logging is straightforward enough to be used
here.

```java
//: exceptions/LoggingExceptions.java
// An exception that reports through a Logger.
import java.util.logging.*;
import java.io.*;

class LoggingException extends Exception {
    private static Logger logger =
        Logger.getLogger("LoggingException");
    public LoggingException() {
        StringWriter trace = new StringWriter();
        printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(trace));
        logger.severe(trace.toString());
    }
}

public class LoggingExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new LoggingException();
        } catch (LoggingException e) {
            System.err.println("Caught " + e);
        }
        try {
            throw new LoggingException();

        } catch (LoggingException e) {
            System.err.println("Caught " + e);
        }
    }
}/* Output: (85% match)

Caught LoggingException
*///:~
```
The static `logger.geTlogger( )` method creates a Logger object associated with the
String argument (usually the name of the package and class that the errors are about) which
sends its output to `System.err`. The easiest way to write to a Logger is just to call the
method associated with the level of logging message; here, `severe( )` is used. To produce the
String for the logging message, we'd like to have the stack trace where the exception is
thrown, but `prinTstacKtrace( )` doesn't produce a String by default. To get a String, we
need to use the overloaded `prinTstacKtrace( )` that takes a `java.io.PrintWriter` object as
an argument (all of this will be fully explained in the I/O chapter). If we hand the Print
Writer constructor a `java.io.StringWriter` object, the output can be extracted as a String
by calling `toString( )`.

Although the approach used by LoggingException is very convenient because it builds all
the logging infrastructure into the exception itself, and thus it works automatically without
client programmer intervention, it's more common that you will be catching and logging
someone else's exception, so you must generate the log message in the exception handler:

```java
//: exceptions/LoggingExceptions2.java
// Logging caught exceptions.
import java.util.logging.*;
import java.io.*;

public class LoggingExceptions2 {
    private static Logger logger =
        Logger.getLogger("LoggingExceptions2");
    static void logException(Exception e) {
        StringWriter trace = new StringWriter();
        e.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(trace));
        logger.severe(trace.toString());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new NullPointerException();
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            logException(e);
        }
    }
} /* Output: (90% match)
Aug 30, 2005 4:07:54 PM LoggingExceptions2 logException
SEVERE: java.lang.NullPointerException
at LoggingExceptions2.main(LoggingExceptions2.java:16)
*///:~
```
The process of creating your own exceptions can be taken further. You can add extra
constructors and members:

```java
//: exceptions/ExtraFeatures.java
// Further embellishment of exception classes.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class MyException2 extends Exception {
    private int x;
    public MyException2() {}
    public MyException2(String msg) { super(msg); }
    public MyException2(String msg, int x) {
        super(msg);
        this.x = x;
    }
    public int val() { return x; }
    public String getMessage() {
        return "Detail Message: " + x + " " + super.getMessage();
    }
}

public class ExtraFeatures {
    public static void f() throws MyException2 {
        print("Throwing MyException2 from f()");
        throw new MyException2();
    }
    public static void g() throws MyException2 {
        print("Throwing MyException2 from g()");
        throw new MyException2("Originated in g()");
    }
    public static void h() throws MyException2 {
        print("Throwing MyException2 from h()");
        throw new MyException2("Originated in h()", 47);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            f();
        } catch (MyException2 e) {
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
        try {
            g();
        } catch (MyException2 e) {
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
        try {
            h();
        } catch (MyException2 e) {
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
            System.out.println("e.val() = " + e.val());
        }
    }
} /* Output:

*///:~
```
A field x has been added, along with a method that reads that value and an additional
constructor that sets it. In addition, `throwable.geTmessage( )` has been overridden to
produce a more interesting detail message. `geTmessage( )` is something like `tOstring( )` for
exception classes.

Since an exception is just another kind of object, you can continue this process of
embellishing the power of your exception classes. Keep in mind, however, that all this
dressing-up might be lost on the client programmers using your packages, since they might
simply look for the exception to be thrown and nothing more. (That's the way most of the
Java library exceptions are used.)

Exercise 6: (1) Create two exception classes, each of which performs its own logging
automatically. Demonstrate that these work.

Exercise 7: (1) Modify Exercise 3 so that the catch clause logs the results.

## üçÄ14.10. The exception specification
In Java, you're encouraged to inform the client programmer, who calls your method, of the
exceptions that might be thrown from your method. This is civilized, because the caller can
then know exactly what code to write to catch all potential exceptions. Of course, if the source
code is available, the client programmer could hunt through and look for throw statements,
but a library might not come with sources. To prevent this from being a problem, Java
provides syntax (and forces you to use that syntax) to allow you to politely tell the client
programmer what exceptions this method throws, so the client programmer can handle
them. This is the exception specification and it's part of the method declaration, appearing
after the argument list.

The exception specification uses an additional keyword, throws, followed by a list of all the
potential exception types. So your method definition might look like this:

    void f() throws TooBig, TooSmall, DivZero { //...
    However, if you say
    void f() { //...

it means that no exceptions are thrown from the method {except for the exceptions inherited
from RuntimeException, which can be thrown anywhere without exception
specifications‚Äîthese will be described later).

You can't lie about an exception specification. If the code within your method causes
exceptions, but your method doesn't handle them, the compiler will detect this and tell you
that you must either handle the exception or indicate with an exception specification that it
may be thrown from your method. By enforcing exception specifications from top to bottom,
Java guarantees that a certain level of exception correctness can be ensured at compile time.

There is one place you can lie: You can claim to throw an exception that you really don't. The
compiler takes your word for it, and forces the users of your method to treat it as if it really
does throw that exception. This has the beneficial effect of being a placeholder for that
exception, so you can actually start throwing the exception later without requiring changes to
existing code. It's also important for creating abstract base classes and interfaces whose
derived classes or implementations may need to throw exceptions.

Exceptions that are checked and enforced at compile time are called checked exceptions.

Exercise 8: (1) Write a class with a method that throws an exception of the type created
in Exercise 4. Try compiling it without an exception specification to see what the compiler
says. Add the appropriate exception specification. Try out your class and its exception inside
a try-catch clause.

## üçÄ14.11. Catching any exception
It is possible to create a handler that catches any type of exception. You do this by catching
the base-class exception type Exception (there are other types of base exceptions, but
Exception is the base that's pertinent to virtually all programming activities):

    catch(Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Caught an exception");
    }

This will catch any exception, so if you use it you'll want to put it at the end of your list of
handlers to avoid preempting any exception handlers that might otherwise follow it.

Since the Exception class is the base of all the exception classes that are important to the
programmer, you don't get much specific information about the exception, but you can call
the methods that come from its base type Throwable:

    String getMessage( )
    String getLocalizedMessage( )

Gets the detail message, or a message adjusted for this particular locale.

    String toString( )

Returns a short description of the Throwable, including the detail message if there is one.

    void printStackTrace( )
    void printStackTrace(PrintStream)
    void printStackTrace(java.io.PrintWriter)

Prints the Throwable and the Throwable's call stack trace. The call stack shows the
sequence of method calls that brought you to the point at which the exception was thrown.
The first version prints to standard error, the second and third print to a stream of your
choice (in the I/O chapter, you'll understand why there are two types of streams).

    Throwable fillInStackTrace( )

Records information within this Throwable object about the current state of the stack
frames. Useful when an application is rethrowing an error or exception (more about this
shortly).

In addition, you get some other methods from Throwable's base type Object (everybody's
base type). The one that might come in handy for exceptions is getClass( ), which returns an
object representing the class of this object. You can in turn query this Class object for its
name with getName( ), which includes package information, or getSimpleName( ),
which produces the class name alone.

Here's an example that shows the use of the basic Exception methods:

```java
//: exceptions/ExceptionMethods.java
// Demonstrating the Exception Methods.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ExceptionMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new Exception("My Exception");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            print("Caught Exception");
            print("getMessage():" + e.getMessage());
            print("getLocalizedMessage():" +
                e.getLocalizedMessage());
            print("toString():" + e);
            print("printStackTrace():");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
    }
}/* Output:
Caught Exception
getMessage():My Exception
getLocalizedMessage():My Exception
toString():java.lang.Exception: My Exception
printStackTrace():
java.lang.Exception: My Exception
at ExceptionMethods.main(ExceptionMethods.java:8)
*///:~
```
You can see that the methods provide successively more information‚Äîeach is effectively a
superset of the previous one.

Exercise 9: (2) Create three new types of exceptions. Write a class with a method that
throws all three. In main( ), call the method but only use a single catch clause that will
catch all three types of exceptions.

## üçÄ14.12. The stack trace
The information provided by printStackTrace( ) can also be accessed directly using
getStackTrace( ). This method returns an array of stack trace elements, each representing
one stack frame. Element zero is the top of the stack, and is the last method invocation in the
sequence (the point this Throwable was created and thrown). The last element of the array
and the bottom of the stack is the first method invocation in the sequence. This program
provides a simple demonstration:

```java
//: exceptions/WhoCalled.java
// Programmatic access to stack trace information.

public class WhoCalled {
    static void f() {
        // Generate an exception to fill in the stack trace
        try {
            throw new Exception();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            for (StackTraceElement ste: e.getStackTrace())
                System.out.println(ste.getMethodName());
        }
    }
    static void g() { f(); }
    static void h() { g(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f();
        System.out.println("--------------------------------");
        g();
        System.out.println("--------------------------------");

        h();
    }
} /* Output:
f
main
--------------------------------
f
g
main
--------------------------------
f
g
h
main
*///:~
```
Here, we just print the method name, but you can also print the entire
StackTraceElement, which contains additional information.

## üçÄ14.13. Rethrowing an exception
Sometimes you'll want to rethrow the exception that you just caught, particularly when you
use Exception to catch any exception. Since you already have the reference to the current
exception, you can simply rethrow that reference:

    catch(Exception e) {
        System.out.println("An exception was thrown");
        throw e;
    }

Rethrowing an exception causes it to go to the exception handlers in the nexthigher context.
Any further catch clauses for the same try block are still ignored. In addition, everything
about the exception object is preserved, so the handler at the higher context that catches the
specific exception type can extract all the information from that object.

If you simply rethrow the current exception, the information that you print about that
exception in printStackTrace( ) will pertain to the exception's origin, not the place where
you rethrow it. If you want to install new stack trace information, you can do so by calling
fillInStackTrace( ), which returns a Throwable object that it creates by stuffing the
current stack information into the old exception object. Here's what it looks like:

```java
//: exceptions/Rethrowing.java
// Demonstrating fillInStackTrace()

public class Rethrowing {
    public static void f() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("originating the exception in f()");
        throw new Exception("thrown from f()");
    }
    public static void g() throws Exception {
        try {
            f();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Inside g(),e.printStackTrace()");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
            throw e;
        }
    }
    public static void h() throws Exception {

        try {
            f();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Inside h(),e.printStackTrace()");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
            throw (Exception) e.fillInStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            g();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("main: printStackTrace()");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
        try {
            h();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("main: printStackTrace()");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
    }
} /* Output:

The line where fillInStackTrace( ) is called becomes the new point of origin of the
exception.

It's also possible to rethrow a different exception from the one you caught. If you do this, you
get a similar effect as when you use fillInStackTrace( )‚Äî the information about the
original site of the exception is lost, and what you're left with is the information pertaining to
the new throw:

```java
//: exceptions/RethrowNew.java
// Rethrow a different object from the one that was caught.

class OneException extends Exception {
    public OneException(String s) { super(s); }
}

class TwoException extends Exception {
    public TwoException(String s) { super(s); }
}

public class RethrowNew {
    public static void f() throws OneException {
        System.out.println("originating the exception in f()");
        throw new OneException("thrown from f()");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            try {
                f();
            } catch (OneException e) {
                System.out.println(
                    "Caught in inner try, e.printStackTrace()");
                e.printStackTrace(System.out);
                throw new TwoException("from inner try");
            }
        } catch (TwoException e) {
            System.out.println(
                "Caught in outer try, e.printStackTrace()");
            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        }
    }
} /* Output:

The final exception knows only that it came from the inner try block and not from f( ).
You never have to worry about cleaning up the previous exception, or any exceptions for that
matter. They're all heap-based objects created with new, so the garbage collector
automatically cleans them all up.

## üçÄ14.14. Exception chaining
Often you want to catch one exception and throw another, but still keep the information
about the originating exception‚Äîthis is called exception chaining. Prior to JDK 1.4,
programmers had to write their own code to preserve the original exception information, but
now all Throwable subclasses have the option to take a cause object in their constructor.

The cause is intended to be the originating exception, and by passing it in you maintain the
stack trace back to its origin, even though you're creating and throwing a new exception.

It's interesting to note that the only Throwable subclasses that provide the cause argument
in the constructor are the three fundamental exception classes `Error` (used by the JVM to
report system errors), `Exception`, and `RuntimeException`. If you want to chain any other
exception types, you do it through the `initCause( )` method rather than the constructor.

Here's an example that allows you to dynamically add fields to a DynamicFields object at
run time:

```java
//: exceptions/DynamicFields.java

// A Class that dynamically adds fields to itself.
// Demonstrates exception chaining.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class DynamicFieldsException extends Exception {}

public class DynamicFields {
    private Object[][] fields;
    public DynamicFields(int initialSize) {
        fields = new Object[initialSize][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++)
            fields[i] = new Object[] { null, null };
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (Object[] obj: fields) {
            result.append(obj[0]);
            result.append(": ");
            result.append(obj[1]);
            result.append("\n");
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
    private int hasField(String id) {
        for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
            if (id.equals(fields[i][0]))
                return i;
        return -1;
    }
    private int
    getFieldNumber(String id) throws NoSuchFieldException {
        int fieldNum = hasField(id);
        if (fieldNum == -1)
            throw new NoSuchFieldException();
        return fieldNum;
    }
    private int makeField(String id) {
        for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
            if (fields[i][0] == null) {
                fields[i][0] = id;
                return i;
            }
        // No empty fields. Add one:
        Object[][] tmp = new Object[fields.length + 1][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
            tmp[i] = fields[i];
        for (int i = fields.length; i < tmp.length; i++)
            tmp[i] = new Object[] { null, null };
        fields = tmp;
        // Recursive call with expanded fields:
        return makeField(id);
    }
    public Object
    getField(String id) throws NoSuchFieldException {
        return fields[getFieldNumber(id)][1];
    }
    public Object setField(String id, Object value)
    throws DynamicFieldsException {
        if (value == null) {
            // Most exceptions don't have a "cause" constructor.
            // In these cases you must use initCause(),
            // available in all Throwable subclasses.
            DynamicFieldsException dfe =
                new DynamicFieldsException();
            dfe.initCause(new NullPointerException());
            throw dfe;
        }
        int fieldNumber = hasField(id);
        if (fieldNumber == -1)
            fieldNumber = makeField(id);
        Object result = null;
        try {
            result = getField(id); // Get old value
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException e) {
            // Use constructor that takes "cause":
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        fields[fieldNumber][1] = value;
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DynamicFields df = new DynamicFields(3);
        print(df);
        try {
            df.setField("d", "A value for d");
            df.setField("number", 47);
            df.setField("number2", 48);

            e.printStackTrace(System.out);
        } catch (DynamicFieldsException e) {

        }
    }

```
Each DynamicFields object contains an array of Object-Object pairs. The first object is
the field identifier (a String), and the second is the field value, which can be any type except
an unwrapped primitive. When you create the object, you make an educated guess about how
many fields you need. When you call `seTfield( )`, it either finds the existing field by that

name or creates a new one, and puts in your value. If it runs out of space, it adds new space
by creating an array of length one longer and copying the old elements in. If you try to put in
a null value, then it throws a DynamicFieldsException by creating one and using
`iniTcause( )` to insert a NullPointerException as the cause.

As a return value, `seTfield( )` also fetches out the old value at that field location using
`geTfield( )`, which could throw a NoSuchFieldException. If the client programmer calls
`geTfield( )`, then they are responsible for handling NoSuchFieldException, but if this
exception is thrown inside `seTfield( )`, it's a programming error, so the
NoSuchFieldException is converted to a RuntimeException using the constructor that
takes a cause argument.

You'll notice that `tOstring( )` uses a StringBuilder to create its result. You'll learn more
about StringBuilder in the Strings chapter, but in general you'll want to use it whenever
you're writing a `tOstring( )` that involves looping, as is the case here.

Exercise 10: (2) Create a class with two methods, f( ) and g( ). In g( ), throw an
exception of a new type that you define. In f( ), call g( ), catch its exception and, in the catch
clause, throw a different exception (of a second type that you define). Test your code in
main( ).

Exercise 11: (1) Repeat the previous exercise, but inside the catch clause, wrap g( )'s
exception in a RuntimeException.

## üçÄ14.15. Standard Java exceptions
The Java class Throwable describes anything that can be thrown as an exception. There are
two general types of Throwable objects ("types of = "inherited from"). Error represents
compile-time and system errors that you don't worry about catching (except in very special
cases). Exception is the basic type that can be thrown from any of the standard Java library
class methods and from your methods and runtime accidents. So the Java programmer's
base type of interest is usually Exception.

The best way to get an overview of the exceptions is to browse the JDK documentation. It's
worth doing this once just to get a feel for the various exceptions, but you'll soon see that
there isn't anything special between one exception and the next except for the name. Also,
the number of exceptions in Java keeps expanding; basically, it's pointless to print them in a
book. Any new library you get from a third-party vendor will probably have its own
exceptions as well. The important thing to understand is the concept and what you should do
with the exceptions.

The basic idea is that the name of the exception represents the problem that occurred, and
the exception name is intended to be relatively selfexplanatory. The exceptions are not all
defined in java.lang; some are created to support other libraries such as util, net, and io,
which you can see from their full class names or what they are inherited from. For example,
all I/O exceptions are inherited from java.io.IOException.
Special case: RuntimeException

The first example in this chapter was

    if(t == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();

It can be a bit horrifying to think that you must check for null on every reference that is
passed into a method (since you can't know if the caller has passed you a valid reference).
Fortunately, you don't‚Äîthis is part of the standard runtime checking that Java performs for
you, and if any call is made to a null reference, Java will automatically throw a
NullPointerException. So the above bit of code is always superfluous, although you may
want to perform other checks in order to guard against the appearance of a
NullPointerException.

There's a whole group of exception types that are in this category. They're always thrown
automatically by Java and you don't need to include them in your exception specifications.
Conveniently enough, they're all grouped together by putting them under a single base class
called RuntimeException, which is a perfect example of inheritance: It establishes a family
of types that have some characteristics and behaviors in common. Also, you never need to
write an exception specification saying that a method might throw a RuntimeException
(or any type inherited from RuntimeException), because they are unchecked exceptions.
Because they indicate bugs, you don't usually catch a RuntimeException‚Äîit's dealt with
automatically. If you were forced to check for RuntimeExceptions, your code could get too
messy. Even though you don't typically catch RuntimeExceptions, in your own packages
you might choose to throw some of the RuntimeExceptions.

What happens when you don't catch such exceptions? Since the compiler doesn't enforce
exception specifications for these, it's quite plausible that a RuntimeException could
percolate all the way out to your main( ) method without being caught. To see what happens
in this case, try the following example:

```java
//: exceptions/NeverCaught.java
// Ignoring RuntimeExceptions.
// {ThrowsException}

public class NeverCaught {
    static void f() {
        throw new RuntimeException("From f()");
    }
    static void g() {
        f();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        g();
    }
} ///:~
```
You can already see that a RuntimeException (or anything inherited from it) is a special
case, since the compiler doesn't require an exception specification for these types. The output
is reported to System.err:

    Exception in thread "main" Java.lang.RuntimeException: From f()
    at NeverCaught.f(NeverCaught.Java:7)
    at NeverCaught.g(NeverCaught.Java:10)
    at NeverCaught.main(NeverCaught.Java:13)

So the answer is: If a RuntimeException gets all the way out to main( ) without being
caught, printStackTrace( ) is called for that exception as the program exits.

Keep in mind that only exceptions of type RuntimeException (and subclasses) can be
ignored in your coding, since the compiler carefully enforces the handling of all checked
exceptions. The reasoning is that a RuntimeException represents a programming error,
which is:

1. An error you cannot anticipate. For example, a null reference that is outside of your
control.

2. An error that you, as a programmer, should have checked for in your code (such as
ArraylndexOutOfBoundsException where you should have paid attention to the
size of the array). An exception that happens from point #1 often becomes an issue for
point #2.

You can see what a tremendous benefit it is to have exceptions in this case, since they help in
the debugging process.

It's interesting to notice that you cannot classify Java exception handling as a single-purpose
tool. Yes, it is designed to handle those pesky runtime errors that will occur because of forces
outside your code's control, but it's also essential for certain types of programming bugs that
the compiler cannot detect.

Exercise 12: (3) Modify innerclasses/Sequence.java so that it throws an appropriate
exception if you try to put in too many elements.

## üçÄ14.16. Performing cleanup with finally
There's often some piece of code that you want to execute whether or not an exception is
thrown within a try block. This usually pertains to some operation other than memory
recovery (since that's taken care of by the garbage collector). To achieve this effect, you use a
finally clause ‚Å¥ at the end of all the exception handlers. The full picture of an exception-
handling section is thus:

‚Å¥ C++ exception handling does not have the finally clause because it relies on destructors to 
accomplish this sort of cleanup.

```java
    try {
    // The guarded region: Dangerous activities
    // that might throw A, B, or C
    } catch(A a1) {
    // Handler for situation A
    } catch(B b1) {
    // Handler for situation B
    } catch(C c1) {
    // Handler for situation C
    } finally {
    // Activities that happen every time
    }
```

To demonstrate that the finally clause always runs, try this program:

```java
//: exceptions/FinallyWorks.java
// The finally clause is always executed.

class ThreeException extends Exception {}

public class FinallyWorks {
    static int count = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while (true) {
            try {

                // Post-increment is zero first time:
                if (count++ == 0)
                    throw new ThreeException();
                System.out.println("No exception");
            } catch (ThreeException e) {
                System.out.println("ThreeException");
            } finally {
                System.out.println("In finally clause");
                if (count == 2) break; // out of "while"
            }
        }
    }
} /* Output:
ThreeException
In finally clause
No exception
In finally clause
*///:~
```
From the output, you can see that the finally clause is executed whether or not an exception
is thrown.

This program also gives a hint for how you can deal with the fact that exceptions in Java do
not allow you to resume back to where the exception was thrown, as discussed earlier. If you
place your try block in a loop, you can establish a condition that must be met before you
continue the program. You can also add a static counter or some other device to allow the
loop to try several different approaches before giving up. This way you can build a greater
level of robustness into your programs.

## üçÄ14.17. What's finally for?
In a language without garbage collection and without automatic destructor calls, ‚Åµ finally is
important because it allows the programmer to guarantee the release of memory regardless
of what happens in the try block. But Java has garbage collection, so releasing memory is
virtually never a problem. Also, it has no destructors to call. So when do you need to use
finally in Java?

‚Åµ A destructor is a function that's always called when an object becomes unused. You always 
know exactly where and when the destructor gets called. C++ has automatic destructor calls, 
and C# (which is much more like Java) has a way that automatic destruction can occur.

The finally clause is necessary when you need to set something other than memory back to
its original state. This is some kind of cleanup like an open file or network connection,
something you've drawn on the screen, or even a switch in the outside world, as modeled in
the following example:

```java
//: exceptions/Switch.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Switch {
    private boolean state = false;
    public boolean read() { return state; }
    public void on() { state = true; print(this); }
    public void off() { state = false; print(this); }
    public String toString() { return state ? "on" : "off"; }
} ///:~

//: exceptions/OnOffException1.java
public class OnOffException1 extends Exception {} ///:~

//: exceptions/OnOffException2.java
public class OnOffException2 extends Exception {} ///:~

//: exceptions/OnOffSwitch.java
// Why use finally?

public class OnOffSwitch {
    private static Switch sw = new Switch();
    public static void f()
    throws OnOffException1, OnOffException2 {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            sw.on();
            // Code that can throw exceptions...
            f();
            sw.off();
        } catch (OnOffException1 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException1");
            sw.off();
        } catch (OnOffException2 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException2");
            sw.off();
        }
    }
}/* Output:
on
off
*///:~
```
The goal here is to make sure that the switch is off when main( ) is completed, so sw.off( )
is placed at the end of the try block and at the end of each exception handler. But it's possible
that an exception might be thrown that isn't caught here, so sw.off( ) would be missed.
However, with finally you can place the cleanup code from a try block in just one place:

```java
//: exceptions/WithFinally.java
// Finally Guarantees cleanup.

public class WithFinally {
    static Switch sw = new Switch();
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            sw.on();
            // Code that can throw exceptions...
            OnOffSwitch.f();
        } catch (OnOffException1 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException1");
        } catch (OnOffException2 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException2");
        } finally {
            sw.off();
        }
    }
}/* Output:
on
off
*///:~
```
Here the sw.off( ) has been moved to just one place, where it's guaranteed to run no matter
what happens.

Even in cases in which the exception is not caught in the current set of catch clauses, finally
will be executed before the exception-handling mechanism continues its search for a handler
at the next higher level:

```java
//: exceptions/AlwaysFinally.java
// Finally is always executed.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class FourException extends Exception {}

public class AlwaysFinally {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("Entering first try block");
        try {
            print("Entering second try block");
            try {
                throw new FourException();
            } finally {
                print("finally in 2nd try block");
            }
        } catch (FourException e) {
            System.out.println(
                "Caught FourException in 1st try block");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("finally in 1st try block");
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Entering first try block
Entering second try block
finally in 2nd try block
Caught FourException in 1st try block
finally in 1st try block
*///:~
```
The finally statement will also be executed in situations in which break and continue
statements are involved. Note that, along with the labeled break and labeled continue,
finally eliminates the need for a goto statement in Java.

Exercise 13: (2) Modify Exercise 9 by adding a finally clause. Verify that your finally
clause is executed, even if a NullPointerException is thrown.

Exercise 14: (2) Show that OnOffSwitch.java can fail by throwing a
RuntimeException inside the try block.

Exercise 15: (2) Show that WithFinally.java doesn't fail by throwing a
RuntimeException inside the try block.

## üçÄ14.18. Using finally during return
Because a finally clause is always executed, it's possible to return from multiple points
within a method and still guarantee that important cleanup will be performed:

```java
//: exceptions/MultipleReturns.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class MultipleReturns {
    public static void f(int i) {
        print("Initialization that requires cleanup");

        try {
            print("Point 1");
            if (i == 1) return;
            print("Point 2");
            if (i == 2) return;
            print("Point 3");
            if (i == 3) return;
            print("End");
            return;
        } finally {
            print("Performing cleanup");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
            f(i);
    }
} /* Output:
Initialization that requires cleanup
Point 1
Performing cleanup
Initialization that requires cleanup
Point 1
Point 2
Performing cleanup
Initialization that requires cleanup
Point 1
Point 2
Point 3
Performing cleanup
Initialization that requires cleanup
Point 1
Point 2
Point 3
End
Performing cleanup
*///:~
```
You can see from the output that it doesn't matter where you return from inside the finally
class.

Exercise 16: (2) Modify reusing/CADSystem.java to demonstrate that returning
from the middle of a try-finally will still perform proper cleanup.

Exercise 17: (3) Modify polymorphism/Frog.java so that it uses try-finally to
guarantee proper cleanup, and show that this works even if you return from the middle of
the try-finally.

## üçÄ14.19. Pitfall: the lost exception
Unfortunately, there's a flaw in Java's exception implementation. Although exceptions are an
indication of a crisis in your program and should never be ignored, it's possible for an
exception to simply be lost. This happens with a particular configuration using a finally
clause:

```java
//: exceptions/LostMessage.java
// How an exception can be lost.

class VeryImportantException extends Exception {
    public String toString() {
        return "A very important exception!";
    }
}

class HoHumException extends Exception {
    public String toString() {
        return "A trivial exception";
    }
}

public class LostMessage {
    void f() throws VeryImportantException {
        throw new VeryImportantException();
    }
    void dispose() throws HoHumException {
        throw new HoHumException();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            LostMessage lm = new LostMessage();
            try {
                lm.f();
            } finally {
                lm.dispose();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
} /* Output:
A trivial exception
*///:~
```
You can see from the output that there's no evidence of the VerylmportantException,
which is simply replaced by the HoHumException in the finally clause. This is a rather
serious pitfall, since it means that an exception can be completely lost, and in a far more
subtle and difficult-to-detect fashion than the preceding example. In contrast, C++ treats the
situation in which a second exception is thrown before the first one is handled as a dire
programming error. Perhaps a future version of Java will repair this problem (on the other
hand, you will typically wrap any method that throws an exception, such as dispose( ) in the
example above, inside a try-catch clause).

An even simpler way to lose an exception is just to return from inside a finally clause:

```java
//: exceptions/ExceptionSilencer.java

public class ExceptionSilencer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new RuntimeException();
        } finally {
            // Using 'return' inside the finally block
            // will silence any thrown exception.
            return;
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
If you run this program you'll see that it produces no output, even though an exception is
thrown.


Exercise 18: (3) Add a second level of exception loss to LostMessage.java so that the
HoHumException is itself replaced by a third exception.

Exercise 19: (2) Repair the problem in LostMessage.java by guarding the call in the
finally clause.

## üçÄ14.20. Exception restrictions
When you override a method, you can throw only the exceptions that have been specified in
the base-class version of the method. This is a useful restriction, since it means that code that
works with the base class will automatically work with any object derived from the base class
(a fundamental OOP concept, of course), including exceptions.

This example demonstrates the kinds of restrictions imposed (at compile time) for
exceptions:

```java
//: exceptions/StormyInning.java
// Overridden methods may throw only the exceptions
// specified in their base-class versions, or exceptions
// derived from the base-class exceptions.

class BaseballException extends Exception {}
class Foul extends BaseballException {}
class Strike extends BaseballException {}

abstract class Inning {
    public Inning() throws BaseballException {}
    public void event() throws BaseballException {
        // Doesn't actually have to throw anything
    }
    public abstract void atBat() throws Strike, Foul;
    public void walk() {} // Throws no checked exceptions
}

class StormException extends Exception {}
class RainedOut extends StormException {}
class PopFoul extends Foul {}

interface Storm {
    public void event() throws RainedOut;
    public void rainHard() throws RainedOut;
}

public class StormyInning extends Inning implements Storm {
    // OK to add new exceptions for constructors, but you
    // must deal with the base constructor exceptions:
    public StormyInning() throws RainedOut, BaseballException {}
    public StormyInning(String s) throws Foul, BaseballException {}
    // Regular methods must conform to base class:
    //! void walk() throws PopFoul {} //Compile error
    // Interface CANNOT add exceptions to existing
    // methods from the base class:
    //! public void event() throws RainedOut {}
    // If the method doesn't already exist in the
    // base class, the exception is OK:
    public void rainHard() throws RainedOut {}
    // You can choose to not throw any exceptions,

    // even if the base version does:
    public void event() {}
    // Overridden methods can throw inherited exceptions:
    public void atBat() throws PopFoul {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            StormyInning si = new StormyInning();
            si.atBat();
        } catch (PopFoul e) {
            System.out.println("Pop foul");
        } catch (RainedOut e) {
            System.out.println("Rained out");
        } catch (BaseballException e) {
            System.out.println("Generic baseball exception");
        }
        // Strike not thrown in derived version.
        try {
            // What happens if you upcast?
            Inning i = new StormyInning();
            i.atBat();
            // You must catch the exceptions from the
            // base-class version of the method:
        } catch (Strike e) {
            System.out.println("Strike");
        } catch (Foul e) {
            System.out.println("Foul");
        } catch (RainedOut e) {
            System.out.println("Rained out");
        } catch (BaseballException e) {
            System.out.println("Generic baseball exception");
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
In Inning, you can see that both the constructor and the event( ) method say that they will
throw an exception, but they never do. This is legal because it allows you to force the user to
catch any exceptions that might be added in overridden versions of event( ). The same idea
holds for abstract methods, as seen in atBat( ).

The interface Storm is interesting because it contains one method (event( )) that is defined
in Inning, and one method that isn't. Both methods throw a new type of exception,
RainedOut. When Stormylnning extends Inning and implements Storm, you'll see
that the event( ) method in Storm cannot change the exception interface of event( ) in
Inning. Again, this makes sense because otherwise you'd never know if you were catching
the correct thing when working with the base class. Of course, if a method described in an
interface is not in the base class, such as rainHard( ), then there's no problem if it throws
exceptions.

The restriction on exceptions does not apply to constructors. You can see in Stormylnning
that a constructor can throw anything it wants, regardless of what the base-class constructor
throws. However, since a base-class constructor must always be called one way or another
(here, the default constructor is called automatically), the derived-class constructor must
declare any base-class constructor exceptions in its exception specification.

A derived-class constructor cannot catch exceptions thrown by its base-class constructor.
The reason StormyInning.walk( ) will not compile is that it throws an exception, but
Inning.walk( ) does not. If this were allowed, then you could write code that called
Inning.walk( ) and that didn't have to handle any exceptions, but then when you
substituted an object of a class derived from Inning, exceptions would be thrown so your
code would break. By forcing the derived-class methods to conform to the exception
specifications of the base-class methods, substitutability of objects is maintained.

The overridden event( ) method shows that a derived-class version of a method may choose
not to throw any exceptions, even if the base-class version does. Again, this is fine since it
doesn't break code that is written assuming the base-class version throws exceptions. Similar
logic applies to atBat( ), which throws PopFoul, an exception that is derived from Foul
thrown by the base-class version of atBat( ). This way, if you write code that works with
Inning and calls atBat( ), you must catch the Foul exception. Since PopFoul is derived
from Foul, the exception handler will also catch PopFoul.

The last point of interest is in main( ). Here, you can see that if you're dealing with exactly a
StormyInning object, the compiler forces you to catch only the exceptions that are specific
to that class, but if you upcast to the base type, then the compiler (correctly) forces you to
catch the exceptions for the base type. All these constraints produce much more robust
exceptionhandling code. ‚Å∂

‚Å∂ ISO C++ added similar constraints that require derived-method exceptions to be the same as,
or derived from, the exceptions thrown by the base-class method. This is one case in which C++ 
is actually able to check exception specifications at compile time.

Although exception specifications are enforced by the compiler during inheritance, the
exception specifications are not part of the type of a method, which comprises only the
method name and argument types. Therefore, you cannot overload methods based on
exception specifications. In addition, just because an exception specification exists in a base-
class version of a method doesn't mean that it must exist in the derived-class version of the
method. This is quite different from inheritance rules, where a method in the base class must
also exist in the derived class. Put another way, the "exception specification interface" for a
particular method may narrow during inheritance and overriding, but it may not widen‚Äîthis
is precisely the opposite of the rule for the class interface during inheritance.

Exercise 20: (3) Modify StormyInning.java by adding an UmpireArgument
exception type and methods that throw this exception. Test the modified hierarchy.

## üçÄ14.21. Constructors
It's important that you always ask, "If an exception occurs, will everything be properly
cleaned up?" Most of the time you're fairly safe, but with constructors there's a problem. The
constructor puts the object into a safe starting state, but it might perform some operation‚Äî
such as opening a filethat doesn't get cleaned up until the user is finished with the object and
calls a special cleanup method. If you throw an exception from inside a constructor, these
cleanup behaviors might not occur properly. This means that you must be especially diligent
while you write your constructor.

You might think that finally is the solution. But it's not quite that simple, because finally
performs the cleanup code every time. If a constructor fails partway through its execution, it
might not have successfully created some part of the object that will be cleaned up in the
finally clause.

In the following example, a class called InputFile is created that opens a file and allows you
to read it one line at a time. It uses the classes FileReader and BufferedReader from the
Java standard I/O library that will be discussed in the I/O chapter. These classes are simple
enough that you probably won't have any trouble understanding their basic use:

```java
//: exceptions/InputFile.java
// Paying attention to exceptions in constructors.
import java.io.*;

public class InputFile {
    private BufferedReader in ;
    public InputFile(String fname) throws Exception {
        try { in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fname));
            // Other code that might throw exceptions
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Could not open " + fname);
            // Wasn't open, so don't close it
            throw e;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // All other exceptions must close it
            try { 
                in .close();
            } catch (IOException e2) {
                System.out.println("in.close() unsuccessful");
            }
            throw e; // Rethrow
        } finally {
            // Don't close it here!!!
        }
    }
    public String getLine() {
        String s;
        try {
            s = in .readLine();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("readLine() failed");
        }
        return s;
    }
    public void dispose() {
        try { 
            in .close();
            System.out.println("dispose() successful");
        } catch (IOException e2) {
            throw new RuntimeException("in.close() failed");
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
The constructor for InputFile takes a String argument, which is the name of the file you
want to open. Inside a try block, it creates a FileReader using the file name. A FileReader
isn't particularly useful until you use it to create a BufferedReader. One of the benefits of
InputFile is that it combines these two actions.

If the FileReader constructor is unsuccessful, it throws a FileNotFoundException. This
is the one case in which you don't want to close the file, because it wasn't successfully
opened. Any other catch clauses must close the file because it was opened by the time those
catch clauses are entered. (Of course, this gets trickier if more than one method can throw a
FileNotFoundException. In that case, you'll usually have to break things into several try
blocks.) The close( ) method might throw an exception so it is tried and caught even though
it's within the block of another catch clause‚Äîit's just another pair of curly braces to the Java
compiler. After performing local operations, the exception is rethrown, which is appropriate
because this constructor failed, and you don't want the calling method to assume that the
object has been properly created and is valid.

In this example, the finally clause is definitely not the place to close( ) the file, since that
would close it every time the constructor completed. We want the file to be open for the
useful lifetime of the InputFile object.

The getLine( ) method returns a String containing the next line in the file. It calls
readLine( ), which can throw an exception, but that exception is caught so that getLine( )
doesn't throw any exceptions. One of the design issues with exceptions is whether to handle
an exception completely at this level, to handle it partially and pass the same exception (or a
different one) on, or whether to simply pass it on. Passing it on, when appropriate, can
certainly simplify coding. In this situation, the getLine( ) method converts the exception to
a RuntimeException to indicate a programming error.

The dispose( ) method must be called by the user when the InputFile object is no longer
needed. This will release the system resources (such as file handles) that are used by the
BufferedReader and/or FileReader objects. You don't want to do this until you're
finished with the InputFile object. You might think of putting such functionality into a
finalize( ) method, but as mentioned in the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, you can't
always be sure that finalize( ) will be called (even if you can be sure that it will be called,
you don't know when). This is one of the downsides to Java: All cleanupother than memory
cleanup‚Äîdoesn't happen automatically, so you must inform the client programmers that
they are responsible.

The safest way to use a class which might throw an exception during construction and which
requires cleanup is to use nested try blocks:

```java
//: exceptions/Cleanup.java
// Guaranteeing proper cleanup of a resource.

public class Cleanup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputFile in = new InputFile("Cleanup.java");
            try {
                String s;
                int i = 1;
                while ((s = in.getLine()) != null);
                // Perform line-by-line processing here...
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Caught Exception in main");
                e.printStackTrace(System.out);
            } finally { in .dispose();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("InputFile construction failed");
        }
    }
} /* Output:
dispose() successful
*///:~
```
Look carefully at the logic here: The construction of the InputFile object is effectively in its
own try block. If that construction fails, the outer catch clause is entered and dispose( ) is
not called. However, if construction succeeds then you want to make sure the object is
cleaned up, so immediately after construction you create a new try block. The finally that
performs cleanup is associated with the inner try block; this way, the finally clause is not
executed if construction fails, and it is always executed if construction succeeds.

This general cleanup idiom should still be used if the constructor throws no exceptions. The
basic rule is: Right after you create an object that requires cleanup, begin a try-finally:

```java
//: exceptions/CleanupIdiom.java
// Each disposable object must be followed by a try-finally

class NeedsCleanup { // Construction can't fail
    private static long counter = 1;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public void dispose() {
        System.out.println("NeedsCleanup " + id + " disposed");
    }
}

class ConstructionException extends Exception {}

class NeedsCleanup2 extends NeedsCleanup {
    // Construction can fail:
    public NeedsCleanup2() throws ConstructionException {}
}

public class CleanupIdiom {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Section 1:
        NeedsCleanup nc1 = new NeedsCleanup();
        try {
            // ...
        } finally {
            nc1.dispose();
        }

        // Section 2:
        // If construction cannot fail you can group objects:
        NeedsCleanup nc2 = new NeedsCleanup();
        NeedsCleanup nc3 = new NeedsCleanup();
        try {
            // ...
        } finally {
            nc3.dispose(); // Reverse order of construction
            nc2.dispose();
        }

        // Section 3:
        // If construction can fail you must guard each one:
        try {
            NeedsCleanup2 nc4 = new NeedsCleanup2();
            try {
                NeedsCleanup2 nc5 = new NeedsCleanup2();
                try {
                    // ...
                } finally {
                    nc5.dispose();
                }
            } catch (ConstructionException e) { // nc5 constructor
                System.out.println(e);
            } finally {
                nc4.dispose();
            }
        } catch (ConstructionException e) { // nc4 constructor
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
} /* Output:
NeedsCleanup 1 disposed
NeedsCleanup 3 disposed
NeedsCleanup 2 disposed
NeedsCleanup 5 disposed
NeedsCleanup 4 disposed
*///:~
```

In main( ), section 1 is fairly straightforward: You follow a disposable object with a try-
finally. If the object construction cannot fail, no catch is necessary. In section 2, you can see
that objects with constructors that cannot fail can be grouped together for both construction
and cleanup.

Section 3 shows how to deal with objects whose constructors can fail and which need
cleanup. To properly handle this situation, things get messy, because you must surround
each construction with its own try-catch, and each object construction must be followed by
a try-finally to guarantee cleanup.

The messiness of exception handling in this case is a strong argument for creating
constructors that cannot fail, although this is not always possible.

Note that if dispose( ) can throw an exception you might need additional try blocks.
Basically, you must think carefully about all the possibilities and guard for each one.

Exercise 21: (2) Demonstrate that a derived-class constructor cannot catch exceptions
thrown by its base-class constructor.

Exercise 22: (2) Create a class called FailingConstructor with a constructor that
might fail partway through the construction process and throw an exception. In main( ),
write code that properly guards against this failure.

Exercise 23: (4) Add a class with a dispose( ) method to the previous exercise. Modify
FailingConstructor so that the constructor creates one of these disposable objects as a
member object, after which the constructor might throw an exception, after which it creates a
second disposable member object. Write code to properly guard against failure, and in
main( ) verify that all possible failure situations are covered.

Exercise 24: (3) Add a dispose( ) method to the FailingConstructor class and write
code to properly use this class.

## üçÄ14.22. Exception matching
When an exception is thrown, the exception-handling system looks through the "nearest"
handlers in the order they are written. When it finds a match, the exception is considered
handled, and no further searching occurs.

Matching an exception doesn't require a perfect match between the exception and its
handler. A derived-class object will match a handler for the base class, as shown in this
example:

```java
//: exceptions/Human.java
// Catching exception hierarchies.

class Annoyance extends Exception {}
class Sneeze extends Annoyance {}

public class Human {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Catch the exact type:
        try {
            throw new Sneeze();
        } catch (Sneeze s) {
            System.out.println("Caught Sneeze");
        } catch (Annoyance a) {
            System.out.println("Caught Annoyance");

        }
        // Catch the base type:
        try {
            throw new Sneeze();
        } catch (Annoyance a) {
            System.out.println("Caught Annoyance");
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Caught Sneeze
Caught Annoyance
*///:~
```
The Sneeze exception will be caught by the first catch clause that it matches, which is the
first one, of course. However, if you remove the first catch clause, leaving only the catch
clause for Annoyance, the code still works because it's catching the base class of Sneeze.
Put another way, catch(Annoyance a) will catch an Annoyance or any class derived
from it. This is useful because if you decide to add more derived exceptions to a method, then
the client programmer's code will not need changing as long as the client catches the base-
class exceptions.

If you try to "mask" the derived-class exceptions by putting the base-class catch clause first,
like this:

```java
try {
    throw new Sneeze();
} catch(Annoyance a) {
    // ...
} catch(Sneeze s) {
    // ...
}
```
the compiler will give you an error message, since it sees that the Sneeze catch clause can
never be reached.

Exercise 25: (2) Create a three-level hierarchy of exceptions. Now create a base-class A
with a method that throws an exception at the base of your hierarchy. Inherit B from A and
override the method so it throws an exception at level two of your hierarchy. Repeat by
inheriting class C from B. In main( ), create a C and upcast it to A, then call the method.

## üçÄ14.23. Alternative approaches
An exception-handling system is a trapdoor that allows your program to abandon execution
of the normal sequence of statements. The trapdoor is used when an "exceptional condition"
occurs, such that normal execution is no longer possible or desirable. Exceptions represent
conditions that the current method is unable to handle. The reason exception-handling
systems were developed is because the approach of dealing with each possible error condition
produced by each function call was too onerous, and programmers simply weren't doing it.
As a result, they were ignoring the errors. It's worth observing that the issue of programmer
convenience in handling errors was a prime motivation for exceptions in the first place.
One of the important guidelines in exception handling is "Don't catch an exception unless
you know what to do with it." In fact, one of the important goals of exception handling is to
move the error-handling code away from the point where the errors occur. This allows you to
focus on what you want to accomplish in one section of your code, and how you're going to
deal with problems in a distinct separate section of your code. As a result, your mainline code
is not cluttered with error-handling logic, and it's much easier to understand and maintain.

Exception handling also tends to reduce the amount of error-handling code, by allowing one
handler to deal with many error sites.

Checked exceptions complicate this scenario a bit, because they force you to add catch
clauses in places where you may not be ready to handle an error. This results in the "harmful
if swallowed" problem:

```java
try {
    // ... to do something useful
} catch(ObligatoryException e) {} // Gulp!
```
Programmers (myself included, in the 1 st edition of this book) would just do the simplest
thing, and "swallow" the exception‚Äîoften unintentionally, but once you do it, the compiler
has been satisfied, so unless you remember to revisit and correct the code, the exception will
be lost. The exception happens, but it vanishes completely when swallowed. Because the
compiler forces you to write code right away to handle the exception, this seems like the
easiest solution even though it's probably the worst thing you can do.

Horrified upon realizing that I had done this, in the 2 nd edition I "fixed" the problem by
printing the stack trace inside the handler (as is still seen‚Äî appropriately‚Äîin a number of
examples in this chapter). While this is useful to trace the behavior of exceptions, it still
indicates that you don't really know what to do with the exception at that point in your code.
In this section you'll learn about some of the issues and complications arising from checked
exceptions, and options that you have when dealing with them.

This topic seems simple. But it is not only complicated, it is also an issue of some volatility.
There are people who are staunchly rooted on either side of the fence and who feel that the
correct answer (theirs) is blatantly obvious. I believe the reason for one of these positions is
the distinct benefit seen in going from a poorly typed language like pre-ANSI C to a strong,
statically typed language (that is, checked at compile time) like C++ or Java. When you make
that transition (as I did), the benefits are so dramatic that it can seem like static type
checking is always the best answer to most problems. My hope is to relate a little bit of my
own evolution that has brought the absolute value of static type checking into question;
clearly, it's very helpful much of the time, but there's a fuzzy line we cross when it begins to
get in the way and become a hindrance (one of my favorite quotes is "All models are wrong.
Some are useful.").

## üçÄ14.24. History
Exception handling originated in systems like PL/1 and Mesa, and later appeared in CLU,
Smalltalk, Modula-3, Ada, Eiffel, C++, Python, Java, and the post-Java languages Ruby and
C#. The Java design is similar to C++, except in places where the Java designers felt that the
C++ approach caused problems. To provide programmers with a framework that they were
more likely to use for error handling and recovery, exception handling was added to C++
rather late in the standardization process, promoted by Bjarne Stroustrup, the language's
original author. The model for C++ exceptions came primarily from CLU. However, other
languages existed at that time that also supported exception handling: Ada, Smalltalk (both
of these had exceptions but no exception specifications) and Modula-3 (which included both
exceptions and specifications).

In their seminal paper ‚Å∑ on the subject, Liskov and Snyder observe that a major defect of
languages like C, which report errors in a transient fashion, is that:

‚Å∑ Barbara Liskov and Alan Snyder, Exception Handling in CLU, IEEE Transactions on 
Software Engineering, Vol. SE-5, No. 6, November 1979. This paper is not available 
on the Internet, only in print form, so you'll have to contact a library to get a copy.

"...every invocation must be followed by a conditional test to determine what the
outcome was. This requirement leads to programs that are difficult to read, and
probably inefficient as well, thus discouraging programmers from signaling and
handling exceptions."

Thus one of the original motivations of exception handling was to prevent this requirement,
but with checked exceptions in Java we commonly see exactly this kind of code. 
They go on to say:
"...requiring that the text of a handler be attached to the invocation that raises the
exception would lead to unreadable programs in which expressions were broken up with
handlers."

Following the CLU approach when designing C++ exceptions, Stroustrup stated that the goal
was to reduce the amount of code required to recover from errors. I believe that he was
observing that programmers were typically not writing error-handling code in C because the
amount and placement of such code was daunting and distracting. As a result, they were used
to doing it the C way, ignoring errors in code and using debuggers to track down problems.
To use exceptions, these C programmers had to be convinced to write "additional" code that
they weren't normally writing. Thus, to draw them into a better way of handling errors, the
amount of code they would need to "add" must not be onerous. I think it's important to keep
this goal in mind when looking at the effects of checked exceptions in Java.

C++ brought an additional idea over from CLU: the exception specification, to
programmatically state in the method signature the exceptions that could result from calling
that method. The exception specification really has two purposes. It can say, "I'm originating
this exception in my code; you handle it." But it can also mean, "I'm ignoring this exception
that can occur as a result of my code; you handle it." We've been focusing on the "you handle
it" part when looking at the mechanics and syntax of exceptions, but here I'm particularly
interested in the fact that we often ignore exceptions and that's what the exception
specification can state.

In C++ the exception specification is not part of the type information of a function. The only
compile-time checking is to ensure that exception specifications are used consistently; for
example, if a function or method throws exceptions, then the overloaded or derived versions
must also throw those exceptions. Unlike Java, however, no compile-time checking occurs to
determine whether or not the function or method will actually throw that exception, or
whether the exception specification is complete (that is, whether it accurately describes all
exceptions that maybe thrown). That validation does happen, but only at run time. If an
exception is thrown that violates the exception specification, the C++ program will call the
standard library function unexpected( ).

It is interesting to note that, because of the use of templates, exception specifications are not
used at all in the Standard C++ Library. In Java, there are restrictions on the way that Java
generics can be used with exception specifications.

## üçÄ14.25. Perspectives
First, it's worth noting that Java effectively invented the checked exception (clearly inspired
by C++ exception specifications and the fact that C++ programmers typically don't bother
with them). However, it was an experiment which no subsequent language has chosen to
duplicate.

Secondly, checked exceptions appear to be an "obvious good thing" when seen in
introductory examples and in small programs. It has been suggested that the subtle
difficulties begin to appear when programs start to get large. Of course, largeness usually
doesn't happen overnight; it creeps. Languages that may not be suited for large-scale projects

are used for small projects. These projects grow, and at some point we realize that things
have gone from "manageable" to "difficult." This is what I'm suggesting may be the case with
too much type checking; in particular, with checked exceptions.

The scale of the program seems to be a significant issue. This is a problem because most
discussions tend to use small programs as demonstrations. One of the C# designers observed
that:
"Examination of small programs leads to the conclusion that requiring exception
specifications could both enhance developer productivity and enhance code quality, but
experience with large software projects suggests a different result‚Äîdecreased
productivity and little or no increase in code quality." ‚Å∏

In reference to uncaught exceptions, the CLU creators stated:
"We felt it was unrealistic to require the programmer to provide handlers in situations
where no meaningful action can be taken." ‚Åπ

When explaining why a function declaration with no specification means that it can throw
any exception, rather than no exceptions, Stroustrup states:
"However, that would require exception specifications for essentially every function,
would be a significant cause for recompilation, and would inhibit cooperation with
software written in other languages. This would encourage programmers to subvert the
exception-handling mechanisms and to write spurious code to suppress exceptions. It
would provide a false sense of security to people who failed to notice the exception." ¬π‚Å∞ 

We see this very behavior‚Äîsubverting the exceptions‚Äîhappening with checked exceptions in
Java.

Martin Fowler (author of UML Distilled, Refactoring, and Analysis Patterns) wrote the
following to me:
"...on the whole I think that exceptions are good, but Java checked exceptions are more
trouble than they are worth."

I now think that Java's important step was to unify the error-reporting model, so that all
errors are reported using exceptions. This wasn't happening with C++, because for backward
compatibility with C the old model of just ignoring errors was still available. But if you have
consistent reporting with exceptions, then exceptions can be used if desired, and if not, they
will propagate out to the highest level (the console or other container program). When Java
modified the C++ model so that exceptions were the only way to report errors, the extra
enforcement of checked exceptions may have become less necessary.

In the past, I have been a strong believer that both checked exceptions and static type
checking were essential to robust program development. However, both anecdotal and direct
experience ¬π¬π with languages that are more dynamic than static has led me to think that the
great benefits actually come from:

‚Å∏ http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=indoonA&L=DOTNET&P=R32820
‚Åπ Exception Handling in CLU, Liskov & Snyder.
¬π‚Å∞ Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language, 3rd Edition (Addison-Wesley, 1997), P-376.
¬π¬π Indirectly with Smalltalk via conversations with many experienced programmers in that language; directly with Python (www.Python.org).

1. A unified error-reporting model via exceptions, regardless of whether the programmer
is forced by the compiler to handle them.

2. Type checking, regardless of when it takes place. That is, as long as proper use of a
type is enforced, it often doesn't matter if it happens at compile time or run time.

On top of this, there are very significant productivity benefits to reducing the compile-time
constraints upon the programmer. Indeed, reflection and generics are required to
compensate for the overconstraining nature of static typing, as you shall see in a number of
examples throughout the book.

I've already been told by some that what I say here constitutes blasphemy, and by uttering
these words my reputation will be destroyed, civilizations will fall, and a higher percentage of
programming projects will fail. The belief that the compiler can save your project by pointing
out errors at compile time runs strong, but it's even more important to realize the limitation
of what the compiler is able to do; in the supplement you will find at
http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava, I emphasize the value of an automated build
process and unit testing, which give you far more leverage than you get by trying to turn
everything into a syntax error. It's worth keeping in mind that:
"A good programming language is one that helps programmers write good programs.
No programming language will prevent its users from writing bad programs." ¬π¬≤
In any event, the likelihood of checked exceptions ever being removed from Java seems dim.
It would be too radical of a language change, and proponents within Sun appear to be quite
strong. Sun has a history and policy of absolute backwards compatibility‚Äîto give you a sense
of this, virtually all Sun software runs on all Sun hardware, no matter how old. However, if
you find that some checked exceptions are getting in your way, or especially if you find
yourself being forced to catch exceptions, but you don't know what to do with them, there are
some alternatives.

## üçÄ14.26. Passing exceptions to the console
In simple programs, like many of those in this book, the easiest way to preserve the
exceptions without writing a lot of code is to pass them out of main( ) to the console. For
example, if you want to open a file for reading (something you'll learn about in detail in the
I/O chapter), you must open and close a FilelnputStream, which throws exceptions. For a
simple program, you can do this (you'll see this approach used in numerous places
throughout this book):

```java
//: exceptions/MainException.java
import java.io.*;

public class MainException {
    // Pass all exceptions to the console:
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Open the file:
        FileInputStream file =
            new FileInputStream("MainException.java");
        // Use the file ...
        // Close the file:
        file.close();
    }
} ///:~
```

Note that main( ) is also a method that may have an exception specification, and here the
type of exception is Exception, the root class of all checked exceptions. By passing it out to
the console, you are relieved from writing try-catch clauses within the body of main( ).
(Unfortunately, file I/O is significantly more complex than it would appear to be from this
example, so don't get too excited until after you've read the I/O chapter).

Exercise 26: (1) Change the file name string in MainException.java to name a file
that doesn't exist. Run the program and note the result.

## üçÄ14.27. Converting checked to unchecked exceptions
Throwing an exception from main( ) is convenient when you're writing simple programs for
your own consumption, but is not generally useful. The real problem is when you are writing
an ordinary method body, and you call another method and realize, "I have no idea what to
do with this exception here, but I don't want to swallow it or print some banal message."
With chained exceptions, a new and simple solution prevents itself. You simply "wrap" a
checked exception inside a RuntimeException by passing it to the RuntimeException
constructor, like this:

```java
try {
    // ... to do something useful
} catch(IDontKnowWhatToDoWithThisCheckedException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```
This seems to be an ideal solution if you want to "turn off the checked exception‚Äîyou don't
swallow it, and you don't have to put it in your method's exception specification, but because
of exception chaining you don't lose any information from the original exception.

This technique provides the option to ignore the exception and let it bubble up the call stack
without being required to write try-catch clauses and/or exception specifications. However,
you may still catch and handle the specific exception by using getCause( ), as seen here:

```java
//: exceptions/TurnOffChecking.java
// "Turning off" Checked exceptions.
import java.io.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class WrapCheckedException {
    void throwRuntimeException(int type) {
        try {
            switch (type) {
                case 0:
                    throw new FileNotFoundException();
                case 1:
                    throw new IOException();
                case 2:
                    throw new RuntimeException("Where am I?");
                default:
                    return;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) { // Adapt to unchecked:
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}

class SomeOtherException extends Exception {}

public class TurnOffChecking {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WrapCheckedException wce = new WrapCheckedException();
        // You can call throwRuntimeException() without a try

        // block, and let RuntimeExceptions leave the method:
        wce.throwRuntimeException(3);
        // Or you can choose to catch exceptions:
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            try {
                if (i < 3)
                    wce.throwRuntimeException(i);
                else
                    throw new SomeOtherException();
            } catch (SomeOtherException e) {
                print("SomeOtherException: " + e);
            } catch (RuntimeException re) {
                try {
                    throw re.getCause();
                } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
                    print("FileNotFoundException: " + e);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    print("IOException: " + e);
                } catch (Throwable e) {
                    print("Throwable: " + e);
                }
            }
    }
} /* Output:
FileNotFoundException: java.io.FileNotFoundException
IOException: java.io.IOException
Throwable: java.lang.RuntimeException: Where am I?
SomeOtherException: SomeOtherException
*///:~
```
WrapCheckedException.throwRuntimeException( ) contains code that generates
different types of exceptions. These are caught and wrapped inside RuntimeException
objects, so they become the "cause" of those exceptions.

In TurnOffChecking, you can see that it's possible to call throwRuntimeException( )
with no try block because the method does not throw any checked exceptions. However,
when you're ready to catch exceptions, you still have the ability to catch any exception you
want by putting your code inside a try block. You start by catching all the exceptions you
explicitly know might emerge from the code in your try block‚Äîin this case,
SomeOtherException is caught first. Lastly, you catch RuntimeException and throw
the result of getCause( ) (the wrapped exception). This extracts the originating exceptions,
which can then be handled in their own catch clauses.

The technique of wrapping a checked exception in a RuntimeException will be used when
appropriate throughout the rest of this book. Another solution is to create your own subclass
of RuntimeException. This way, it doesn't need to be caught, but someone can catch it if
they want to.

Exercise 27: (1) Modify Exercise 3 to convert the exception to a RuntimeException.

Exercise 28: (1) Modify Exercise 4 so that the custom exception class inherits from
RuntimeException, and show that the compiler allows you to leave out the try block.

Exercise 29: (1) Modify all the exception types in Stormylnning.java so that they
extend RuntimeException, and show that no exception specifications or try blocks are
necessary. Remove the '//!' comments and show how the methods can be compiled without
specifications.

Exercise 30: (2) Modify Human.java so that the exceptions inherit from
RuntimeException. Modify main( ) so that the technique in TurnOffChecking.java is
used to handle the different types of exceptions.

## üçÄ14.28. Exception guidelines
Use exceptions to:
1. Handle problems at the appropriate level. (Avoid catching exceptions unless you know
what to do with them.)

2. Fix the problem and call the method that caused the exception again.

3. Patch things up and continue without retrying the method.

4. Calculate some alternative result instead of what the method was supposed to
produce.

5. Do whatever you can in the current context and rethrow the same exception to a
higher context.

6. Do whatever you can in the current context and throw a different exception to a higher
context.

7. Terminate the program.

8. Simplify. (If your exception scheme makes things more complicated, then it is painful
and annoying to use.)

9. Make your library and program safer. (This is a short-term investment for debugging,
and a long-term investment for application robustness.)

## üçÄ14.29 Summary
Exceptions are integral to programming with Java; you can accomplish only so much
without knowing how to work with them. For that reason, exceptions are introduced at
this point in the book‚Äîthere are many libraries (like I/O, mentioned earlier) that you
can't use without handling exceptions.

One of the advantages of exception handling is that it allows you to concentrate on the
problem you're trying to solve in one place, and then deal with the errors from that code
in another place. And although exceptions are generally explained as tools that allow you
to report and recover from errors at run time, I have come to wonder how often the
"recovery" aspect is implemented, or even possible. My perception is that it is less than 10
percent of the time, and even then it probably amounts to unwinding the stack to a known
stable state rather than actually performing any kind of resumptive behavior. Whether or
not this is true, I have come to believe that the "reporting" function is where the essential
value of exceptions lie. The fact that Java effectively insists that all errors be reported in
the form of exceptions is what gives it a great advantage over languages like C++, which
allow you to report errors in a number of different ways, or not at all. A consistent error-
reporting system means that you no longer have to ask the question "Are errors slipping
through the cracks?" with each piece of code you write (as long as you don't "swallow" the
exceptions, that is!).

As you will see in future chapters, by laying this question to rest‚Äîeven if you do so by
throwing a RuntimeException‚Äîyour design and implementation efforts can be focused
on more interesting and challenging issues.

# üìú 15. Strings
String manipulation is arguably one of the most common
activities in computer programming.

This is especially true in Web systems, where Java is heavily used. In this chapter, we'll look
more deeply at what is certainly the most commonly used class in the language, String,
along with some of its associated classes and utilities.

## üçÄ15.1. Immutable Strings
Objects of the String class are immutable. If you examine the JDK documentation for the
String class, you'll see that every method in the class that appears to modify a String
actually creates and returns a brand new String object containing the modification. The
original String is left untouched.

Consider the following code:

```java
//: strings/Immutable.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Immutable {
    public static String upcase(String s) {
        return s.toUpperCase();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String q = "howdy";
        String qq = upcase(q);
        print(qq); // HOWDY
        print(q); // howdy
    }
} /* Output:
HOWDY
howdy
*///:~
```
When q is passed in to upcase( ) it's actually a copy of the reference to q. The object this
reference is connected to stays in a single physical location. The references are copied as they
are passed around.

Looking at the definition for upcase( ), you can see that the reference that's passed in has
the name s, and it exists for only as long as the body of upcase( ) is being executed. When
upcase( ) completes, the local reference s vanishes. upcase( ) returns the result, which is
the original string with all the characters set to uppercase. Of course, it actually returns a
reference to the result. But it turns out that the reference that it returns is for a new object,
and the original q is left alone.

This behavior is usually what you want. Suppose you say:

    String s = "asdf";
    String x = Immutable.upcase(s);

Do you really want the upcase( ) method to change the argument? To the reader of the
code, an argument usually looks like a piece of information provided to the method, not
something to be modified. This is an important guarantee, since it makes code easier to write
and understand.

## üçÄ15.2. Overloading '+' vs. StringBuilder
Since String objects are immutable, you can alias to a particular String as many times as
you want. Because a String is read-only, there's no possibility that one reference will change
something that will affect the other references.

Immutability can have efficiency issues. A case in point is the operator '+' that has been
overloaded for String objects. Overloading means that an operation has been given an extra
meaning when used with a particular class. (The '+' and '+=' for String are the only
operators that are overloaded in Java, and Java does not allow the programmer to overload
any others.) ¬π The'+' operator allows you to concatenate Strings:

```java
//: strings/Concatenation.java

public class Concatenation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String mango = "mango";
        String s = "abc" + mango + "def" + 47;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
} /* Output:
abcmangodef47
*///:~
```

¬π C++ allows the programmer to overload operators at will. Because this can often be a 
complicated process (see Chapter 10 of Thinking in C++, 2nd Edition, Prentice Hall, 2000), 
the Java designers deemed it a "bad" feature that shouldn't be included in Java. 
It wasn't so bad that they didn't end up doing it themselves, and ironically enough, operator 
overloading would be much easier to use in Java than in C++. This can be seen in Python 
(see www.Python.org) and C#, which have garbage collection and straightforward operator overloading.

You could imagine how this might work. The String "abc" could have a method append( )
that creates a new String object containing "abc" concatenated with the contents of mango.
The new String object would then create another new String that added "def," and so on.
This would certainly work, but it requires the creation of a lot of String objects just to put
together this new String, and then you have a bunch of intermediate String objects that
need to be garbage collected. I suspect that the Java designers tried this approach first (which
is a lesson in software design‚Äîyou don't really know anything about a system until you try it
out in code and get something working). I also suspect that they discovered it delivered
unacceptable performance.

To see what really happens, you can decompile the above code using the javap tool that
comes as part of the JDK. Here's the command line:

    javap -c Concatenation

The -c flag will produce the JVM bytecodes. After we strip out the parts we're not interested
in and do a bit of editing, here are the relevant bytecodes:

```java
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
      Code:
        Stack=2, Locals=3, Args_size=1
        0: ldc #2; //String mango
        2: astore_1
        3: new #3; //class StringBuilder
        6: dup
        7: invokespecial #4; //StringBuilder."<init>":()
        10: ldc #5; // String abc
        12 invokevirtual #6; //StringBuilder.append:(String)
        15 aload_1
        16 invokevirtual #6; //StringBuilder.append:(String)
        19 ldc #7; //String def
        21 invokevirtual #6; //StringBuilder.append:(String)
        24 bipush 47
        26 invokevirtual #8; //StringBuilder.append:(I)
        29 invokevirtual #9; //StringBuilder.toString:()
        32 astore_2
        33 getstatic #10; //Field System.out:PrintStream;
        36 aload_2
        37 invokevirtual #11; // PrintStream.println:(String)
        40 return
```

If you've had experience with assembly language, this may look familiar to you‚Äîstatements
like dup and `invokevirtual` are the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) equivalent of assembly
language. If you've never seen assembly language, don't worry about it‚Äîthe important part to
notice is the introduction by the compiler of the java.lang.StringBuilder class. There was
no mention of `StringBuilder` in the source code, but the compiler decided to use it anyway,
because it is much more efficient.

In this case, the compiler creates a `StringBuilder` object to build the String `s`, and calls
append( ) four times, one for each of the pieces. Finally, it calls toString( ) to produce the
result, which it stores (with `astore_2`) as `s`.

Before you assume that you should just use Strings everywhere and that the compiler will
make everything efficient, let's look a little more closely at what the compiler is doing. Here's
an example that produces a String result in two ways: using Strings, and by hand-coding
with `StringBuilder`:

```java
//: strings/WhitherStringBuilder.java

public class WhitherStringBuilder {
    public String implicit(String[] fields) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
            result += fields[i];
        return result;
    }
    public String explicit(String[] fields) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++)
            result.append(fields[i]);
        return result.toString();
    }
} ///:~
```
Now if you run `javap -c WitherStringBuilder`, you can see the (simplified) code for the
two different methods. First, implicit( ):

```java
    public java.lang.String implicit(java.lang.String[]);
      Code:
        0: ldc #2; //String
        2: astore_2
        3: iconst_0
        4: istore_3
        5: iload_3
        6: aload_1
        7: arraylength
        8: if_icmpge 38
        11: new #3; //class StringBuilder
        14: dup
        15: invokespecial #4; // StringBuilder.‚Äù<init>‚Äù:()
        18: aload_2
        19: invokevirtual #5; // StringBuilder.append:()
        22: aload_1
        23 iload_3
        24 aaload
        25: invokevirtual #5; // StringBuilder.append:()
        28: invokevirtual #6; // StringBuiIder.toString:()
        31: astore_2
        32: iinc 3, 1
        35: goto 5
        38: aload_2
        39 areturn
```

Notice 8: and 35:, which together form a loop. 8: does an "integer compare greater than or
equal to" of the operands on the stack and jumps to 38: when the loop is done. 35: is a goto
back to the beginning of the loop, at 5:. The important thing to note is that the
`StringBuilder` construction happens inside this loop, which means you're going to get a
new `StringBuilder` object every time you pass through the loop.

Here are the bytecodes for explicit( ):

```java
    public java.lang.String explicit(java.lang.String[]);
      Code:
        0: new #3; //class StringBuilder
        3: dup
        4: invokespecial #4; // StringBuilder.‚Äù<init>‚Äù:()
        7: astore_2
        8: iconst_0
        9: istore_3
        10: iload_3
        11: aload_1
        12: arraylength
        13: if_icmpge 30
        16: aload_2
        17: aload_1
        18: iload_3
        19: aaload
        20 invokevirtual #5; // StringBuilder.append:()
        23 pop

```

Not only is the loop code shorter and simpler, the method only creates a single
`StringBuilder` object. Creating an explicit `StringBuilder` also allows you to preallocate its
size if you have extra information about how big it might need to be, so that it doesn't need to
constantly reallocate the buffer.

Thus, when you create a `toString( )` method, if the operations are simple ones that the
compiler can figure out on its own, you can generally rely on the compiler to build the result
in a reasonable fashion. But if looping is involved, you should explicitly use a StringBuilder
in your `toString( )`, like this:

```java
//: strings/UsingStringBuilder.java
import java.util.*;

public class UsingStringBuilder {
    public static Random rand = new Random(47);
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("[");
        for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
            result.append(rand.nextInt(100));
            result.append(", ");
        }
        result.delete(result.length() - 2, result.length());
        result.append("]");
        return result.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UsingStringBuilder usb = new UsingStringBuilder();
        System.out.println(usb);
    }
} /* Output:
[58, 55, 93, 61, 61, 29, 68, 0, 22, 7, 88, 28, 51, 89, 9, 78, 98, 61,
20, 58, 16, 40, 11, 22, 4]
*///:~
```
Notice that each piece of the result is added with an `append( )` statement. If you try to take
shortcuts and do something like `append(a + ": " + c)`, the compiler will jump in and start
making more StringBuilder objects again.

If you are in doubt about which approach to use, you can always run javap to double-check.
Although StringBuilder has a full complement of methods, including `insert( )`, replace(
), `substring( )` and even `reverse( )`, the ones you will generally use are `append( )` and
`toString( )`. Note the use of `delete( )` to remove the last comma and space before adding
the closing square bracket.

StringBuilder was introduced in Java SE5. Prior to this, Java used StringBuffer, which
ensured thread safety (see the Concurrency chapter) and so was significantly more
expensive. Thus, string operations in Java SE5/6 should be faster.

Exercise 1: (2) Analyze SprinklerSystem.toString( ) in
reusing/SprinklerSystem.java to discover whether writing the toString( ) with an
explicit StringBuilder will save any StringBuilder creations.

## üçÄ15.3. Unintended recursion
Because (like every other class) the Java standard containers are ultimately inherited from
Object, they contain a toString( ) method. This has been overridden so that they can
produce a String representation of themselves, including the objects they hold.
ArrayList.toString( ), for example, steps through the elements of the Array List and calls
toString( ) for each one:

```java
//: strings/ArrayListDisplay.java
import generics.coffee.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayListDisplay {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList < Coffee > coffees = new ArrayList < Coffee > ();
        for (Coffee c: new CoffeeGenerator(10))
            coffees.add(c);
        System.out.println(coffees);
    }
} /* Output:
[Americano 0, Latte 1, Americano 2, Mocha 3, Mocha 4, Breve 5, Americano
6, Latte 7, Cappuccino 8, Cappuccino 9]
*///:~
```
Suppose you'd like your toString( ) to print the address of your class. It seems to make
sense to simply refer to this:

```java
//: strings/InfiniteRecursion.java
// Accidental recursion.
// {RunByHand}
import java.util.*;

public class InfiniteRecursion {
    public String toString() {
        return " InfiniteRecursion address: " + this + "\n";
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < InfiniteRecursion > v =
            new ArrayList < InfiniteRecursion > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            v.add(new InfiniteRecursion());
        System.out.println(v);
    }
} ///:~
```
If you create an InfiniteRecursion object and then print it, you'll get a very long sequence
of exceptions. This is also true if you place the InfiniteRecursion objects in an ArrayList
and print that ArrayList as shown here. What's happening is automatic type conversion for
Strings. When you say:

    "InfiniteRecursion address: " + this

The compiler sees a String followed by a'+' and something that's not a String, so it tries to
convert this to a String. It does this conversion by calling toString( ), which produces a
recursive call.

If you really do want to print the address of the object, the solution is to call the
ObjecttoString( ) method, which does just that. So instead of saying this, you'd say
super.toString( ).

Exercise 2: (1) Repair InfiniteRecursion.java.

## üçÄ15.4. Operations on Strings
Here are some of the basic methods available for String objects. Methods that are
overloaded are summarized in a single row:

You can see that every String method carefully returns a new String object when it's
necessary to change the contents. Also notice that if the contents don't need changing, the
method will just return a reference to the original String. This saves storage and overhead.
The String methods involving regular expressions will be explained later in this chapter.

## üçÄ15.5. Formatting output
One of the long-awaited features that has finally appeared in Java SE5 is output formatting in
the style of C's printf( ) statement. Not only does this allow for simplified output code, but it
also gives Java developers powerful control over output formatting and alignment. ¬≤

¬≤ Mark Welsh assisted in the creation of this section, and the "Scanning input" section.

### ‚òò15.5.1. printf()
C's printf( ) doesn't assemble strings the way Java does, but takes a single format string
and inserts values into it, formatting as it goes. Instead of using the overloaded '+' operator
(which C doesn't overload) to concatenate quoted text and variables, printf( ) uses special
placeholders to show where the data should go. The arguments that are inserted into the
format string follow in a comma-separated list.

For example:

    printf("Row 1: [%d %f]\n", x, y);

At run time, the value of x is inserted into %d and the value of y is inserted into %f. These
placeholders are called/ormaf specifiers and, in addition to telling where to insert the value,
they also tell what kind of variable is to be inserted and how to format it. For instance, the
'%d' above says that x is an integer and the '%f says y is a floating point value (a float or
double).

### ‚òò15.5.2. System.out.format()
Java SE5 introduced the format( ) method, available to PrintStream or PrintWriter
objects (which you'll learn more about in the I/O chapter), which includes System.out. The
format( ) method is modeled after C's printf( ). There's even a convenience printf( )
method that you can use if you're feeling nostalgic, which just calls format( ). Here's a
simple example:

```java
//: strings/SimpleFormat.java

public class SimpleFormat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        double y = 5.332542;
        // The old way:
        System.out.println("Row 1: [" + x + " " + y + "]");
        // The new way:
        System.out.format("Row 1: [%d %f]\n", x, y);
        // or
        System.out.printf("Row 1: [%d %f]\n", x, y);
    }
} /* Output:
Row 1: [5 5.332542]
Row 1: [5 5.332542]
Row 1: [5 5.332542]
*///:~
```
You can see that format( ) and printf( ) are equivalent. In both cases, there's only a single
format string, followed by one argument for each format specifier.

### ‚òò15.5.3. The Formatter class
All of Java's new formatting functionality is handled by the Formatter class in the java.util
package. You can think of Formatter as a translator that converts your format string and
data into the desired result. When you create a Formatter object, you tell it where you want
this result to go by passing that information to the constructor:

```java
//: strings/Turtle.java

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Turtle {
    private String name;
    private Formatter f;
    public Turtle(String name, Formatter f) {
        this.name = name;
        this.f = f;
    }
    public void move(int x, int y) {
        f.format("%s The Turtle is at (%d,%d)\n", name, x, y);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrintStream outAlias = System.out;
        Turtle tommy = new Turtle("Tommy",
            new Formatter(System.out));
        Turtle terry = new Turtle("Terry",
            new Formatter(outAlias));
        tommy.move(0, 0);
        terry.move(4, 8);
        tommy.move(3, 4);
        terry.move(2, 5);
        tommy.move(3, 3);
        terry.move(3, 3);
    }
} /* Output:
Tommy The Turtle is at (0,0)
Terry The Turtle is at (4,8)
Tommy The Turtle is at (3,4)
Terry The Turtle is at (2,5)
Tommy The Turtle is at (3,3)
Terry The Turtle is at (3,3)
*///:~
```
All the tommy output goes to System.out and all the terry output goes to an alias of
System.out. The constructor is overloaded to take a range of output locations, but the most
useful are PrintStreams (as above), OutputStreams, and Files. You'll learn more about
these in the I/O chapter.

Exercise 3: (1) Modify Turtle.java so that it sends all output to System.err.
The previous example uses a new format specifier, '%s'. This indicates a String argument
and is an example of the simplest kind of format specifier-one that has only a conversion
type.

### ‚òò15.5.4. Format specifiers
To control spacing and alignment when data is inserted, you need more elaborate format
specifiers. Here's the general syntax:

    %[argument_index$][flags][width][.precision]conversion

Often, you'll need to control the minimum size of a field. This can be accomplished by
specifying a width. The Formatter guarantees that a field is at least a certain number of
characters wide by padding it with spaces if necessary. By default, the data is right justified,
but this can be overridden by including a '-' in the flags section.

The opposite of width is precision, which is used to specify a maximum. Unlike the width,
which is applicable to all of the data conversion types and behaves the same with each,
precision has a different meaning for different types. For Strings, the precision specifies the
maximum number of characters from the String to print. For floating point numbers,
precision specifies the number of decimal places to display (the default is 6), rounding if
there are too many or adding trailing zeroes if there are too few. Since integers have no
fractional part, precision isn't applicable to them and you'll get an exception if you use
precision with an integer conversion type.

This example uses format specifiers to print a shopping receipt:

```java
//: strings/Receipt.java
import java.util.*;

public class Receipt {
    private double total = 0;
    private Formatter f = new Formatter(System.out);
    public void printTitle() {
        f.format("%-15s %5s %10s\n", "Item", "Qty", "Price");
        f.format("%-15s %5s %10s\n", "----", "---", "-----");
    }
    public void print(String name, int qty, double price) {
        f.format("%-15.15s %5d %10.2f\n", name, qty, price);
        total += price;
    }
    public void printTotal() {
        f.format("%-15s %5s %10.2f\n", "Tax", "", total * 0.06);
        f.format("%-15s %5s %10s\n", "", "", "-----");
        f.format("%-15s %5s %10.2f\n", "Total", "",
            total * 1.06);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Receipt receipt = new Receipt();
        receipt.printTitle();
        receipt.print("Jack's Magic Beans", 4, 4.25);
        receipt.print("Princess Peas", 3, 5.1);
        receipt.print("Three Bears Porridge", 1, 14.29);
        receipt.printTotal();
    }
} /* Output:
Item Qty Price
---- --- -----
Jack's Magic Be 4 4.25
Princess Peas 3 5.10
Three Bears Por 1 14.29
Tax 1.42
-----
Total 25.06
*///:~
```
As you can see, the Formatter provides powerful control over spacing and alignment with
fairly concise notation. Here, the format strings are simply copied in order to produce the
appropriate spacing.

Exercise 4: (3) Modify Receipt.java so that the widths are all controlled by a single set of
constant values. The goal is to allow you to easily change a width by changing a single value
in one place.

### ‚òò15.5.5. Formatter conversions
These are the conversions you'll come across most frequently:

| Conversion | Characters |
|------------|------------|
| d | Integral (as decimal)                   |
| c | Unicode character                       |
| b | Boolean value                           |
| s | String                                  |
| f | Floating point (as decimal)             |
| e | Floating point (in scientific notation) |
| x | Integral (as hex)                       |
| h | Hash code (as hex)                      |
| % | Literal "%"                             |

Here's an example that shows these conversions in action:

```java
//: strings/Conversion.java
import java.math.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Conversion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Formatter f = new Formatter(System.out);

        char u = 'a';
        System.out.println("u = 'a'");
        f.format("s: %s\n", u);
        // f.format("d: %d\n", u);
        f.format("c: %c\n", u);
        f.format("b: %b\n", u);
        // f.format("f: %f\n", u);
        // f.format("e: %e\n", u);
        // f.format("x: %x\n", u);
        f.format("h: %h\n", u);

        int v = 121;
        System.out.println("v = 121");
        f.format("d: %d\n", v);
        f.format("c: %c\n", v);
        f.format("b: %b\n", v);
        f.format("s: %s\n", v);
        // f.format("f: %f\n", v);
        // f.format("e: %e\n", v);
        f.format("x: %x\n", v);
        f.format("h: %h\n", v);

        BigInteger w = new BigInteger("50000000000000");
        System.out.println(
            "w = new BigInteger(\"50000000000000\")");

        f.format("d: %d\n", w);
        // f.format("c: %c\n", w);
        f.format("b: %b\n", w);
        f.format("s: %s\n", w);
        // f.format("f: %f\n", w);
        // f.format("e: %e\n", w);
        f.format("x: %x\n", w);
        f.format("h: %h\n", w);

        double x = 179.543;
        System.out.println("x = 179.543");
        // f.format("d: %d\n", x);
        // f.format("c: %c\n", x);
        f.format("b: %b\n", x);
        f.format("s: %s\n", x);
        f.format("f: %f\n", x);
        f.format("e: %e\n", x);
        // f.format("x: %x\n", x);
        f.format("h: %h\n", x);

        Conversion y = new Conversion();
        System.out.println("y = new Conversion()");
        // f.format("d: %d\n", y);
        // f.format("c: %c\n", y);
        f.format("b: %b\n", y);
        f.format("s: %s\n", y);
        // f.format("f: %f\n", y);
        // f.format("e: %e\n", y);
        // f.format("x: %x\n", y);
        f.format("h: %h\n", y);

        boolean z = false;
        System.out.println("z = false");
        // f.format("d: %d\n", z);
        // f.format("c: %c\n", z);
        f.format("b: %b\n", z);
        f.format("s: %s\n", z);
        // f.format("f: %f\n", z);
        // f.format("e: %e\n", z);
        // f.format("x: %x\n", z);
        f.format("h: %h\n", z);
    }

The commented lines show conversions that are invalid for that particular variable type;
executing them will trigger an exception.

Notice that the 'b' conversion works for each variable above. Although it's valid for any
argument type, it might not behave as you'd expect. For boolean primitives or Boolean
objects, the result will be true or false, accordingly. However, for any other argument, as
long as the argument type is not null the result is always true. Even the numeric value of
zero, which is synonymous with false in many languages (including C), will produce true, so
be careful when using this conversion with non-boolean types.

There are more obscure conversion types and other format specifier options. You can read
about these in the JDK documentation for the Formatter class.

Exercise 5: (5) For each of the basic conversion types in the above table, write the most
complex formatting expression possible. That is, use all the possible format specifiers
available for that conversion type.

### ‚òò15.5.6. String.format()
Java SE5 also took a cue from C's sprintf( ), which is used to create Strings.
String.format( ) is a static method which takes all the same arguments as Formatter's
format( ) but returns a String. It can come in handy when you only need to call format( )
once:

```java
//: strings/DatabaseException.java

public class DatabaseException extends Exception {
    public DatabaseException(int transactionID, int queryID,
        String message) {
        super(String.format("(t%d, q%d) %s", transactionID,
            queryID, message));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new DatabaseException(3, 7, "Write failed");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
} /* Output:
DatabaseException: (t3, q7) Write failed
*///:~
```

Under the hood, all String.format( ) does is instantiate a Formatter and pass your
arguments to it, but using this convenience method can often be clearer and easier than
doing it by hand.

### ‚òò15.5.7. A hex dump tool
As a second example, often you want to look at the bytes inside a binary file using hex format.
Here's a small utility that displays a binary array of bytes in a readable hex format, using
String.format( ):

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Hex.java
package net.mindview.util;
import java.io.*;

public class Hex {
    public static String format(byte[] data) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int n = 0;
        for (byte b: data) {
            if (n % 16 == 0)
                result.append(String.format("%05X: ", n));
            result.append(String.format("%02X ", b));
            n++;
            if (n % 16 == 0) result.append("\n");
        }
        result.append("\n");
        return result.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        if (args.length == 0)
            // Test by displaying this class file:
            System.out.println(
                format(BinaryFile.read("Hex.class")));
        else
            System.out.println(
                format(BinaryFile.read(new File(args[0]))));
    }
}/* Output: (Sample)
00000: CA FE BA BE 00 00 00 31 00 52 0A 00 05 00 22 07
00010: 00 23 0A 00 02 00 22 08 00 24 07 00 25 0A 00 26
00020: 00 27 0A 00 28 00 29 0A 00 02 00 2A 08 00 2B 0A
00030: 00 2C 00 2D 08 00 2E 0A 00 02 00 2F 09 00 30 00
00040: 31 08 00 32 0A 00 33 00 34 0A 00 15 00 35 0A 00

...
*///:~
```
To open and read the binary file, this uses another utility that will be introduced in the I/O
chapter: net.mindview.util.BinaryFile. The read( ) method returns the entire file as a
byte array.

Exercise 6: (2) Create a class that contains int, long, float and double fields. Create a
toString( ) method for this class that uses String.format( ), and demonstrate that your
class works correctly.

## üçÄ15.6. Regular expressions
Regular expressions have long been integral to standard Unix utilities like sed and awk, and
languages like Python and Perl (some would argue that they are the predominant reason for
Perl's success). String manipulation tools were previously delegated to the String,

StringBuffer, and StringTokenizer classes in Java, which had relatively simple facilities
compared to regular expressions.

Regular expressions are powerful and flexible text-processing tools. They allow you to
specify, programmatically, complex patterns of text that can be discovered in an input string.
Once you discover these patterns, you can then react to them any way you want. Although the
syntax of regular expressions can be intimidating at first, they provide a compact and
dynamic language that can be employed to solve all sorts of string processing, matching and
selection, editing, and verification problems in a completely general way.

### ‚òò15.6.01. Basics
A regular expression is a way to describe strings in general terms, so that you can say, "If a
string has these things in it, then it matches what I'm looking for." For example, to say that a
number might or might not be preceded by a minus sign, you put in the minus sign followed
by a question mark, like this:

    -?

To describe an integer, you say that it's one or more digits. In regular expressions, a digit is
described by saying '\d'. If you have any experience with regular expressions in other
languages, you'll immediately notice a difference in the way backslashes are handled. In
other languages, '\\' means "I want to insert a plain old (literal) backslash in the regular
expression. Don't give it any special meaning." In Java, ' \ \ ' means "I'm inserting a regular
expression backslash, so that the following character has special meaning." For example, if
you want to indicate a digit, your regular expression string will be '\\d'. If you want to insert
a literal backslash, you say '\\\\'- However, things like newlines and tabs just use a single
backslash: '\n\t'.

To indicate "one or more of the preceding expression," you use a '+'. So to say, "possibly a
minus sign, followed by one or more digits," you write:

    -?\\d+

The simplest way to use regular expressions is to use the functionality built into the String
class. For example, we can see whether a String matches the regular expression above:

```java
//: strings/IntegerMatch.java

public class IntegerMatch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("-1234".matches("-?\\d+"));
        System.out.println("5678".matches("-?\\d+"));
        System.out.println("+911".matches("-?\\d+"));
        System.out.println("+911".matches("(-|\\+)?\\d+"));
    }
} /* Output:
true
true
false
true
*///:~
```

The first two expressions match, but the third one starts with a '+', which is a legitimate sign
but means the number doesn't match the regular expression. So we need a way to say, "may
start with a + or a -." In regular expressions, parentheses have the effect of grouping an
expression, and the vertical bar '|' means OR. So

    (-I\\+)?

means that this part of the string may be either a '-' or a '+' or nothing (because of the '?').
Because the '+' character has special meaning in regular expressions, it must be escaped with
a '\\' in order to appear as an ordinary character in the expression.

A useful regular expression tool that's built into String is split( ), which means, "Split this
string around matches of the given regular expression."

```java
//: strings/Splitting.java
import java.util.*;

public class Splitting {
    public static String knights =
        "Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must " +
        "cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... " +
        "with... a herring!";
    public static void split(String regex) {
        System.out.println(
            Arrays.toString(knights.split(regex)));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        split(" "); // Doesn't have to contain regex chars
        split("\\W+"); // Non-word characters
        split("n\\W+"); // 'n' followed by non-word characters
    }
} /* Output:
[Then,, when, you, have, found, the, shrubbery,, you, must, cut, down,
the, mightiest, tree, in, the, forest..., with..., a, herring!]
[Then, when, you, have, found, the, shrubbery, you, must, cut, down,
the, mightiest, tree, in, the, forest, with, a, herring]
[The, whe, you have found the shrubbery, you must cut dow, the mightiest
tree i, the forest... with... a herring!]
*///:~
```
First, note that you may use ordinary characters as regular expressions‚Äîa regular expression
doesn't have to contain special characters, as you can see in the first call to split( ), which
just splits on whitespace.

The second and third calls to split( ) use '\W', which means a non-word character (the
lowercase version, '\w', means a word character)‚Äîyou can see that the punctuation has been
removed in the second case. The third call to split( ) says, "the letter n followed by one or
more non-word characters." You can see that the split patterns do not appear in the result.
An overloaded version of String. split( ) allows you to limit the number of splits that occur.
The final regular expression tool built into String is replacement. You can either replace the
first occurrence, or all of them:

```java
//: strings/Replacing.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Replacing {
    static String s = Splitting.knights;
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        print(s.replaceFirst("f\\w+", "located"));
        print(s.replaceAll("shrubbery|tree|herring","banana"));
    }
} /* Output:
Then, when you have located the shrubbery, you must cut down the
mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!
Then, when you have found the banana, you must cut down the mightiest
banana in the forest... with... a banana!
*///:~
```
The first expression matches the letter f followed by one or more word characters (note that
the w is lowercase this time). It only replaces the first match that it finds, so the word "found"
is replaced by the word "located."

The second expression matches any of the three words separated by the OR vertical bars, and
it replaces all matches that it finds.

You'll see that the non-String regular expressions have more powerful replacement tools‚Äî
for example, you can call methods to perform replacements. Non-String regular expressions
are also significantly more efficient if you need to use the regular expression more than once.

Exercise 7: (5) Using the documentation for java.util.regex.Pattern as a resource,
write and test a regular expression that checks a sentence to see that it begins with a capital
letter and ends with a period.

Exercise 8: (2) Split the string Splitting.knights on the words "the" or ‚Äúyou."

Exercise 9: (4) Using the documentation for java.util.regex.Pattern as a resource,
replace all the vowels in Splitting.knights with underscores.

### ‚òò15.6.02. Creating regular expressions
You can begin learning regular expressions with a subset of the possible constructs. A
complete list of constructs for building regular expressions can be found in the JDK
documentation for the Pattern class for package java.util.regex.

| Characters |   |
|------------|---|
| B      | The specific character B                             |
| \xhh   | Character with hex value oxhh                        |
| \uhhhh | The Unicode character with hex representation 0xhhhh |
| \t     | Tab                                                  |
| \n     | Newline                                              |
| \r     | Carriage return                                      |
| \f     | Form feed                                            |
| \e     | Escape                                               |


The power of regular expressions begins to appear when you are defining character classes.
Here are some typical ways to create character classes, and some predefined classes:

| Character | Classes |
|-----------|---------|
| .            | Any character                                     |
| [abc]        | Any of the characters a, b, or c (same as `a|b|c`)  |
| [^abc]       | Any character except a, b, and c (negation)       |
| [a-zA-Z]     | Any character a through z or A through Z (range)  |
| [abc[hij]]   | Any of a,b,c,h,I,j (same as `a|b|c|h|i|j`) (union)    |
| [a-z&&[hij]] | Either h, i, or j (intersection)                  |
| \s           | A whitespace character (space, tab, newline, form |
| feed,        | carriage return)                                  |
| \S           | A non-whitespace character ([^\s])                |
| \d           | A numeric digit [0-9]                             |
| \D           | A non-digit [^o-9]                                |
| \w           | A word character [a-zA-Z_0-9]                     |
| \W           | A non-word character [^\w]                        |

What's shown here is only a sample; you'll want to bookmark the JDK documentation page
for java.util.regex.Pattern so you can easily access all the possible regular expression
patterns.

| Logical | Operators |
|---------|-----------|
| XY      | X followed by Y
| X|Y     | X or Y
| (X)     | A capturing group. You can refer to the ith captured group later in the expression with \i.

| Boundary | Matchers |
|----------|----------|
| ^        | Beginning of a line       |
| $        | End of a line             |
| \b       | Word boundary             |
| \B       | Non-word boundary         |
| \G       | End of the previous match |

As an example, each of the following successfully matches the character sequence "Rudolph":

```java
//: strings/Rudolph.java

public class Rudolph {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(String pattern : new String[]{ "Rudolph",
            "[rR]udolph", "[rR][aeiou][a-z]ol.*", "R.*" })
            System.out.println("Rudolph".matches(pattern));
    }
} /* Output:
true
true
true
true
*///:~
```
Of course, your goal should not be to create the most obfuscated regular expression, but
rather the simplest one necessary to do the job. You'll find that, once you start writing regular
expressions, you'll often use your code as a reference when writing new regular expressions.

### ‚òò15.6.03. Quantifiers
A quantifier describes the way that a pattern absorbs input text:
‚Ä¢ Greedy: Quantifiers are greedy unless otherwise altered. A greedy expression finds as
many possible matches for the pattern as possible. A typical cause of problems is to
assume that your pattern will only match the first possible group of characters, when
it's actually greedy and will keep going until it's matched the largest possible string.

‚Ä¢ Reluctant: Specified with a question mark, this quantifier matches the minimum
number of characters necessary to satisfy the pattern. Also called lazy, minimal
matching, non-greedy, or ungreedy.

‚Ä¢ Possessive: Currently this is only available in Java (not in other languages) and is
more advanced, so you probably won't use it right away. As a regular expression is
applied to a string, it generates many states so that it can backtrack if the match fails.
Possessive quantifiers do not keep those intermediate states, and thus prevent
backtracking. They can be used to prevent a regular expression from running away
and also to make it execute more efficiently.

| Greedy | Reluctant | Possessive | Matches |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| X?     | X??     | X?+     | X, one or none                          |
| X*     | X*?     | x*+     | X, zero or more                         |
| x+     | x+?     | X++     | X, one or more                          |
| X{n}   | X{n}?   | X{n}+   | X, exactly n times                      |
| X{n,}  | X{n,}?  | X{n,}+  | X, at least n times                     |
| X{n,m} | X{n,m}? | X{n,m}+ | X, at least n but not more than m times |

Keep in mind that the expression 'X' will often need to be surrounded in parentheses for it to
work the way you desire. For example:

    abc+

might seem like it would match the sequence 'abc' one or more times, and if you apply it to
the input string 'abcabcabc', you will in fact get three matches. However, the expression
actually says, "Match 'ab' followed by one or more occurrences of 'c'." To match the entire
string 'abc' one or more times, you must say:

    (abc)+

You can easily be fooled when using regular expressions; it's an orthogonal language, on top
of Java.

### ‚òò15.6.04. CharSequence
The interface called CharSequence establishes a generalized definition of a character
sequence abstracted from the CharBuffer, String, StringBuffer, or StringBuilder
classes:

```java
interface CharSequence {
    charAt(int i);
    length();
    subSequence(int start, | int end);
    toString();
}
```

The aforementioned classes implement this interface. Many regular expression operations
take CharSequence arguments.

### ‚òò15.6.05. Pattern and Matcher
In general, you'll compile regular expression objects rather than using the fairly limited
String utilities. To do this, you import java.util.regex, then compile a regular expression
by using the static Pattern.compile( ) method. This produces a Pattern object based on
its String argument. You use the Pattern by calling the matcher( ) method, passing the
string that you want to search. The matcher( ) method produces a Matcher object, which
has a set of operations to choose from (you can see all of these in the JDK documentation for
java.util.regex.Matcher). For example, the replaceAll( ) method replaces all the
matches with its argument.

As a first example, the following class can be used to test regular expressions against an input
string. The first command-line argument is the input string to match against, followed by one
or more regular expressions to be applied to the input. Under Unix/Linux, the regular
expressions must be quoted on the command line. This program can be useful in testing
regular expressions as you construct them to see that they produce your intended matching
behavior.

```java
//: strings/TestRegularExpression.java
// Allows you to easily try out regular expressions.
// {Args: abcabcabcdefabc "abc+" "(abc)+" "(abc){2,}" }
import java.util.regex.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class TestRegularExpression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length < 2) {
            print("Usage:\njava TestRegularExpression " +
                "characterSequence regularExpression+");
            System.exit(0);
        }
        print("Input: \"" + args[0] + "\"");
        for (String arg: args) {
            print("Regular expression: \"" + arg + "\"");
            Pattern p = Pattern.compile(arg);
            Matcher m = p.matcher(args[0]);
            while (m.find()) {

                print("Match \"" + m.group() + "\" at positions " +
                    m.start() + "-" + (m.end() - 1));
            }
        }
    }
} /* Output:

Regular expression: "abcabcabcdefabc"

```
A Pattern object represents the compiled version of a regular expression. As seen in the
preceding example, you can use the matcher( ) method and the input string to produce a
Matcher object from the compiled Pattern object. Pattern also has a static method:

    static boolean matches(String regex, CharSequence input)

to check whether regex matches the entire input CharSequence, and a split( ) method
that produces an array of String that has been broken around matches of the regex.
A Matcher object is generated by calling Pattern.matcher( ) with the input string as an
argument. The Matcher object is then used to access the results, using methods to evaluate
the success or failure of different types of matches:

```java
boolean matches()
boolean lookingAt()
boolean find()
boolean find(int start)
```

The matches ( ) method is successful if the pattern matches the entire input string, while
lookingAt( ) is successful if the input string, starting at the beginning, is a match to the
pattern.

Exercise 10: (2) For the phrase "Java now has regular expressions" evaluate whether the
following expressions will find a match:

    ^Java
    \Breg.*
    n.w\s+h(a|i)s
    s?
    s*
    s+
    s{4}
    S{1}.
    s{0,3}

Exercise 11: (2) Apply the regular expression

    (?i)((^[aeiou])|(\s+[aeiou]))\w+?[aeiou]\b

to

    "Arline ate eight apples and one orange while Anita hadn't any"

### ‚òò15.6.06. find()
Matcher.find( ) can be used to discover multiple pattern matches in the CharSequence to
which it is applied. For example:

```java
//: strings/Finding.java
import java.util.regex.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Finding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Matcher m = Pattern.compile("\\w+")
            .matcher("Evening is full of the linnet's wings");
        while (m.find())
            printnb(m.group() + " ");
        print();
        int i = 0;
        while (m.find(i)) {
            printnb(m.group() + " ");
            i++;
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Evening is full of the linnet s wings
Evening vening ening ning ing ng g is is s full full ull ll l of of f
the the he e linnet linnet innet nnet net et t s s wings wings ings ngs
gs s
*///:~
```
The pattern '\\w+' splits the input into words. find( ) is like an iterator, moving forward
through the input string. However, the second version of find( ) can be given an integer
argument that tells it the character position for the beginning of the search‚Äîthis version
resets the search position to the value of the argument, as you can see from the output.

### ‚òò15.6.07. Groups
Groups are regular expressions set off by parentheses that can be called up later with their
group number. Group o indicates the whole expression match, group l is the first
parenthesized group, etc. Thus in

    A(B(C))D

there are three groups: Group 0 is ABCD, group 1 is BC, and group 2 is C.
The Matcher object has methods to give you information about groups:
`public int groupCount( )` returns the number of groups in this matcher's pattern. Group o
is not included in this count.

`public String group( )` returns group 0 (the entire match) from the previous match
operation (find( ), for example).

`public String group(int i)` returns the given group number during the previous match
operation. If the match was successful, but the group specified failed to match any part of the
input string, then null is returned.

`public int start(int group)` returns the start index of the group found in the previous
match operation.

`public int end(int group)` returns the index of the last character, plus one, of the group
found in the previous match operation.

Here's an example:

```java
//: strings/Groups.java
import java.util.regex.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Groups {
    static public final String POEM =
        "Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n" +
        "Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.\n" +
        "All mimsy were the borogoves,\n" +
        "And the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n" +
        "Beware the Jabberwock, my son,\n" +
        "The jaws that bite, the claws that catch.\n" +
        "Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun\n" +
        "The frumious Bandersnatch.";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Matcher m =
            Pattern.compile("(?m)(\\S+)\\s+((\\S+)\\s+(\\S+))$")
            .matcher(POEM);
        while (m.find()) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= m.groupCount(); j++)
                printnb("[" + m.group(j) + "]");
            print();
        }
    }
} /* Output:
[the slithy toves][the][slithy toves][slithy][toves]
[in the wabe.][in][the wabe.][the][wabe.]
[were the borogoves,][were][the borogoves,][the][borogoves,]

[bird, and shun][bird,][and shun][and][shun]

*///:~
```
The poem is the first part of Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky," from Through the Looking Glass.
You can see that the regular expression pattern has a number of parenthesized groups,
consisting of any number of non-whitespace characters ('\S+') followed by any number of
whitespace characters ('\s+'). The goal is to capture the last three words on each line; the end
of a line is delimited by '$'. However, the normal behavior is to match '$' with the end of the
entire input sequence, so you must explicitly tell the regular expression to pay attention to
newlines within the input. This is accomplished with the '(?m)' pattern flag at the beginning
of the sequence (pattern flags will be shown shortly).


Exercise 12: (5) Modify Groups.java to count all of the unique words that do not start
with a capital letter.

### ‚òò15.6.08. start() and end()
Following a successful matching operation, `start( )` returns the start index of the previous
match, and `end( )` returns the index of the last character matched, plus one. Invoking either
`start( )` or `end( )` following an unsuccessful matching operation (or before attempting a
matching operation) produces an IllegalStateException. The following program also
demonstrates `matches( )` and `lookinGat( )`: ¬≥

        void display(String message) {
            if (!regexPrinted) {
                print(regex);
                regexPrinted = true;
            }
            print(message);
        }
    }
    static void examine(String s, String regex) {
        Display d = new Display(regex);
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(regex);
        Matcher m = p.matcher(s);
        while (m.find())
            d.display("find() '" + m.group() +
                "' start = " + m.start() + " end = " + m.end());
        if (m.lookingAt()) // No reset() necessary
            d.display("lookingAt() start = " +
                m.start() + " end = " + m.end());
        if (m.matches()) // No reset() necessary
            d.display("matches() start = " +
                m.start() + " end = " + m.end());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (String in: input.split("\n")) {
            print("input : " + in );
            for (String regex: new String[] {
                    "\\w*ere\\w*",
                    "\\w*ever",
                    "T\\w+",
                    "Never.*?!"
                })
                examine( in , regex);
        }
    }
} /* Output:

```
Notice that find( ) will locate the regular expression anywhere in the input, but
lookingAt( ) and matches( ) only succeed if the regular expression starts matching at the
very beginning of the input. While matches( ) only succeeds if the entire input matches the
regular expression, lookingAt( ) ‚Å¥ succeeds if only the first part of the input matches.

‚Å¥ I have no idea how they came up with this method name, or what it's supposed to 
refer to. But it's reassuring to know that whoever comes up with nonintuitive method 
names is still employed at Sun. And that their apparent policy of not reviewing code 
designs is still in place. Sorry for the sarcasm, but this kind of thing gets tiresome 
after a few years.

Exercise 13: (2) Modify StartEnd.java so that it uses Groups.POEM as input, but
still produces positive outputs for find( ), lookingAt( ) and matches( ).

### ‚òò15.6.09. Pattern flags
An alternative compile( ) method accepts flags that affect matching behavior:

    Pattern Pattern.compile(String regex, int flag)

where flag is drawn from among the following Pattern class constants:

Compile Flag Effect:

1. `Pattern.CANON_EQ` 
    Two characters will be considered to match if, and only if, their full canonical
    decompositions match. The expression '\u003F', for example, will match the
    string '?' when this flag is specified. By default, matching does not take canonical
    equivalence into account.
2. `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` (?i)
    By default, case-insensitive matching assumes that only characters in the US-ASCII 
    character set are being matched. This flag allows your pattern to match without 
    regard to case (upper or lower). Unicode-aware case-insensitive matching can be enabled 
    by specifying the `UNICODE_CASE` flag in conjunction with this flag.
3. `Pattern.COMMENTS` (?x)
    In this mode, whitespace is ignored, and embedded comments starting with # are ignored until
    the end of a line. Unix lines mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression.
4. `Pattern.DOTALL` (?s)
    In dotall mode, the expression'.' matches any character, including a line terminator. 
    By default, the '.' expression does not match line terminators.
5. `Pattern.MULTILINE` (?m)
    In multiline mode, the expressions '^' and '$' match the beginning and ending of a line, 
    respectively.'^' also matches the beginning of the input string, and '$' also matches the 
    end of the input string. By default, these expressions only match at the beginning and 
    the end of the entire input string.
6. `Pattern.UNICODE_CASE`  (?u)
    Case-insensitive matching, when enabled by the `CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag, is done in 
    a manner consistent with the Unicode Standard. By default, case- insensitive matching 
    assumes that only characters in the US-ASCII character set are being matched.
7. Pattern.UNIX LINES (?d)
    In this mode, only the '\n' line terminator is recognized in the behavior of '.', '^', and '$'.

Particularly useful among these flags are Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE, Pattern.MULTILINE, 
and Pattern.COMMENTS (which is helpful for clarity and/or documentation). Note that the 
behavior of most of the flags can also be obtained by inserting the parenthesized characters, 
shown beneath the flags in the table, into your regular expression preceding the place where 
you want the mode to take effect.

You can combine the effect of these and other flags through an "OR" ('|') operation:

```java
//: strings/ReFlags.java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class ReFlags {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("^java",
            Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.MULTILINE);
        Matcher m = p.matcher(
            "java has regex\nJava has regex\n" +
            "JAVA has pretty good regular expressions\n" +
            "Regular expressions are in Java");
        while (m.find())
            System.out.println(m.group());
    }
} /* Output:
java
Java
JAVA
*///:~
```

This creates a pattern that will match lines starting with "Java," "Java," "JAVA," etc., and
attempt a match for each line within a multiline set (matches starting at the beginning of the
character sequence and following each line terminator within the character sequence). Note
that the group( ) method only produces the matched portion.

### ‚òò15.6.10. split()
split( ) divides an input string into an array of String objects, delimited by the regular
expression.

    String[] split(CharSequence input)
    String[] split(CharSequence input, int limit)

This is a handy way to break input text on a common boundary:

```java
//: strings/SplitDemo.java
import java.util.regex.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class SplitDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input =
            "This!!unusual use!!of exclamation!!points";
        print(Arrays.toString(
            Pattern.compile("!!").split(input)));
        // Only do the first three:
        print(Arrays.toString(
            Pattern.compile("!!").split(input, 3)));
    }
} /* Output:
[This, unusual use, of exclamation, points]
[This, unusual use, of exclamation!!points]
*///:~
```

The second form of split( ) limits the number of splits that occur.

Exercise 14: (1) Rewrite SplitDemo using String.split( ).

### ‚òò15.6.11. Replace operations
Regular expressions are especially useful to replace text. Here are the available methods:
`replacEfirst(string replacement)` replaces the first matching part of the input string
with replacement.

`replacEall(string replacement)` replaces every matching part of the input string with
replacement.

`appenDreplacement(strinGbuffer sbuf, string replacement)` performs step-by-step
replacements into sbuf, rather than replacing only the first one or all of them, as in
`replacEfirst( )` and `replacEall( )`, respectively. This is a very important method, because
it allows you to call methods and perform other processing in order to produce
replacement (`replacEfirst( )` and `replacEall( )` are only able to put in fixed strings).
With this method, you can programmatically pick apart the groups and create powerful
replacements.

`appenDtail(strinGbuffer sbuf, string replacement)` is invoked after one or more
invocations of the `appenDreplacement( )` method in order to copy the remainder of the
input string.

Here's an example that shows the use of all the replace operations. The block of commented
text at the beginning is extracted and processed with regular expressions for use as input in
the rest of the example:

```java
//: strings/TheReplacements.java
import java.util.regex.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

/*! Here's a block of text to use as input to
the regular expression matcher. Note that we'll
first extract the block of text by looking for
the special delimiters, then process the
extracted block. !*/

public class TheReplacements {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String s = TextFile.read("TheReplacements.java");
        // Match the specially commented block of text above:
        Matcher mInput =
            Pattern.compile("/\\*!(.*)!\\*/", Pattern.DOTALL)
            .matcher(s);
        if (mInput.find())
            s = mInput.group(1); // Captured by parentheses
        // Replace two or more spaces with a single space:
        s = s.replaceAll(" {2,}", " ");
        // Replace one or more spaces at the beginning of each
        // line with no spaces. Must enable MULTILINE mode:
        s = s.replaceAll("(?m)^ +", "");
        print(s);
        s = s.replaceFirst("[aeiou]", "(VOWEL1)");
        StringBuffer sbuf = new StringBuffer();
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("[aeiou]");
        Matcher m = p.matcher(s);
        // Process the find information as you

        // perform the replacements:
        while (m.find())
            m.appendReplacement(sbuf, m.group().toUpperCase());
        // Put in the remainder of the text:
        m.appendTail(sbuf);
        print(sbuf);
    }
} /* Output:
Here's a block of text to use as input to
the regular expression matcher. Note that we'll
first extract the block of text by looking for
the special delimiters, then process the
extracted block.

```
The file is opened and read using the TextFile class in the net.mindview.util library (the
code for this will be shown in the I/O chapter). The static `read( )` method reads the entire
file and returns it as a String. mInput is created to match all the text (notice the grouping
parentheses) between `/*!` and `!*/`. Then, more than two spaces are reduced to a single
space, and any space at the beginning of each line is removed (in order to do this on all lines
and not just the beginning of the input, multiline mode must be enabled). These two
replacements are performed with the equivalent (but more convenient, in this case)
`replacEall( )` that's part of String. Note that since each replacement is only used once in
the program, there's no extra cost to doing it this way rather than precompiling it as a
Pattern.

`replacEfirst( )` only performs the first replacement that it finds. In addition, the
replacement strings in `replacEfirst( )` and `replacEall( )` are just literals, so if you want to
perform some processing on each replacement, they don't help. In that case, you need to use
`appenDreplacement( )`, which allows you to write any amount of code in the process of
performing the replacement. In the preceding example, a `group( )` is selected and
processed‚Äîin this situation, setting the vowel found by the regular expression to uppercase‚Äî
as the resulting sbuf is being built. Normally, you step through and perform all the
replacements and then call `appenDtail( )`, but if you want to simulate `replacEfirst( )` (or
"replace n"), you just do the replacement one time and then call `appenDtail( )` to put the
rest into sbuf.

`appenDreplacement( )` also allows you to refer to captured groups directly in the
replacement string by saying "$g", where 'g' is the group number. However, this is for
simpler processing and wouldn't give you the desired results in the preceding program.

### ‚òò15.6.12. reset()
An existing Matcher object can be applied to a new character sequence using the `reset( )`
methods:

```java
//: strings/Resetting.java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Resetting {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Matcher m = Pattern.compile("[frb][aiu][gx]")
            .matcher("fix the rug with bags");
        while (m.find())
            System.out.print(m.group() + " ");
        System.out.println();
        m.reset("fix the rig with rags");
        while (m.find())
            System.out.print(m.group() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
fix rug bag
fix rig rag
*///:~
```
reset( ) without any arguments sets the Matcher to the beginning of the current sequence.

### ‚òò15.6.13. Regular expressions and Java I/O
Most of the examples so far have shown regular expressions applied to static strings. The
following example shows one way to apply regular expressions to search for matches in a file.
Inspired by Unix's grep, JGrep.java takes two arguments: a file name and the regular
expression that you want to match. The output shows each line where a match occurs and the
match position(s) within the line.

```java
//: strings/JGrep.java
// A very simple version of the "grep" program.
// {Args: JGrep.java "\\b[Ssct]\\w+"}
import java.util.regex.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class JGrep {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        if (args.length < 2) {
            System.out.println("Usage: java JGrep file regex");
            System.exit(0);
        }
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(args[1]);
        // Iterate through the lines of the input file:
        int index = 0;
        Matcher m = p.matcher("");
        for (String line: new TextFile(args[0])) {
            m.reset(line);
            while (m.find())
                System.out.println(index++ + ": " +
                    m.group() + ": " + m.start());
        }
    }

The file is opened as a net.mindview.util.TextFile object (which will be shown in the I/O
chapter), which reads the lines of the file into an ArrayList. This means that the foreach
syntax can iterate through the lines in the TextFile object.

Although it's possible to create a new Matcher object within the for loop, it is slightly more
optimal to create an empty Matcher object outside the loop and use the reset( ) method to
assign each line of the input to the Matcher. The result is scanned with find( ).
The test arguments open the JGrep.java file to read as input, and search for words starting
with [Ssct].

You can learn much more about regular expressions in Mastering Regular Expressions, 2 nd
Edition, by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl (O'Reilly, 2002). There are also numerous introductions to
regular expressions on the Internet, and you can often find helpful information in the
documentation for languages like Perl and Python.

Exercise 15: (5) Modify JGrep.java to accept flags as arguments (e.g.,
Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE, Pattern.MULTILINE).

Exercise 16: (5) Modify JGrep.java to accept a directory name or a file name as
argument (if a directory is provided, search should include all files in the directory). Hint:
You can generate a list of file names with:

    File[] files = new File(".").listFiles();

Exercise 17: (8) Write a program that reads a Java source-code file (you provide the file
name on the command line) and displays all the comments.

Exercise 18: (8) Write a program that reads a Java source-code file (you provide the file
name on the command line) and displays all the string literals in the code.

Exercise 19: (8) Building on the previous two exercises, write a program that examines
Java source code and produces all the class names used in a particular program.

## üçÄ15.7. Scanning input
Until now it has been relatively painful to read data from a human-readable file or from
standard input. The usual solution is to read in a line of text, tokenize it, and then use the
various parse methods of Integer, Double, etc., to parse the data:

```java
//: strings/SimpleRead.java
import java.io.*;

public class SimpleRead {
    public static BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(
        new StringReader("Sir Robin of Camelot\n22 1.61803"));
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("What is your name?");
            String name = input.readLine();
            System.out.println(name);
            System.out.println(
                "How old are you? What is your favorite double?");

            System.out.println("(input: <age> <double>)");
            String numbers = input.readLine();
            System.out.println(numbers);
            String[] numArray = numbers.split(" ");
            int age = Integer.parseInt(numArray[0]);
            double favorite = Double.parseDouble(numArray[1]);
            System.out.format("Hi %s.\n", name);
            System.out.format("In 5 years you will be %d.\n",
                age + 5);
            System.out.format("My favorite double is %f.",
                favorite / 2);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("I/O exception");
        }
    }
} /* Output:

Sir Robin of Camelot

(input: <age> <double>)

Hi Sir Robin of Camelot.

```
The input field uses classes from java.io, which will not officially be introduced until the
I/O chapter. A StringReader turns a String into a readable stream, and this object is used
to create a BufferedReader because BufferedReader has a readLine( ) method. The
result is that the input object can be read a line at a time, just as if it were standard input
from the console.

readLine( ) is used to get the String for each line of input. It's fairly straightforward when
you want to get one input for each line of data, but if two input values are on a single line,
things get messy‚Äîthe line must be split so we can parse each input separately. Here, the
splitting takes place when creating numArray, but note that the split( ) method was
introduced in J2SE1.4, so before that you had to do something else.

The Scanner class, added in Java SE5, relieves much of the burden of scanning input:

```java
//: strings/BetterRead.java
import java.util.*;

public class BetterRead {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner stdin = new Scanner(SimpleRead.input);
        System.out.println("What is your name?");
        String name = stdin.nextLine();
        System.out.println(name);
        System.out.println(
            "How old are you? What is your favorite double?");
        System.out.println("(input: <age> <double>)");
        int age = stdin.nextInt();
        double favorite = stdin.nextDouble();
        System.out.println(age);
        System.out.println(favorite);
        System.out.format("Hi %s.\n", name);
        System.out.format("In 5 years you will be %d.\n",
            age + 5);
        System.out.format("My favorite double is %f.",
            favorite / 2);

    }
} /* Output:
What is your name?
Sir Robin of Camelot
How old are you? What is your favorite double?
(input: <age> <double>)
22
1.61803
Hi Sir Robin of Camelot.
In 5 years you will be 27.
My favorite double is 0.809015.
*///:~
```
The Scanner constructor can take just about any kind of input object, including a File
object (which will also be covered in the I/O chapter), an InputStream, a String, or in this
case a Readable, which is an interface introduced in Java SE5 to describe "something that
has a read( ) method." The BufferedReader from the previous example falls into this
category.

With Scanner, the input, tokenizing, and parsing are all ensconced in various different
kinds of "next" methods. A plain next( ) returns the next String token, and there are "next"
methods for all the primitive types (except char) as well as for BigDecimal and
Biglnteger. All of the "next" methods block, meaning they will return only after a complete
data token is available for input. There are also corresponding "hasNext" methods that return
true if the next input token is of the correct type.

An interesting difference between the two previous examples above is the lack of a try block
for IOExceptions in BetterRead.java. One of the assumptions made by the Scanner is
that an IOException signals the end of input, and so these are swallowed by the Scanner.
However, the most recent exception is available through the ioException( ) method, so you
are able to examine it if necessary.

Exercise 20: (2) Create a class that contains int, long, float and double and String
fields. Create a constructor for this class that takes a single String argument, and scans that
string into the various fields. Add a toString( ) method and demonstrate that your class
works correctly.

### ‚òò15.7.1. Scanner delimiters
By default, a Scanner splits input tokens along whitespace, but you can also specify your
own delimiter pattern in the form of a regular expression:

```java
//: strings/ScannerDelimiter.java
import java.util.*;

public class ScannerDelimiter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner("12, 42, 78, 99, 42");
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\s*,\\s*");
        while(scanner.hasNextInt())
            System.out.println(scanner.nextInt());
    }
} /* Output:
12
42
78
99
42
*///:~
```

This example uses commas (surrounded by arbitrary amounts of whitespace) as the delimiter
when reading from the given String. This same technique can be used to read from comma-
delimited files. In addition to useDelimiter( ) for setting the delimiter pattern, there is also
delimiter( ), which returns the current Pattern being used as a delimiter.

### ‚òò15.7.2. Scanning with regular expressions
In addition to scanning for predefined primitive types, you can also scan for your own user-
defined patterns, which is helpful when scanning more complex data. This example scans
threat data from a log like your firewall might produce:

```java
//: strings/ThreatAnalyzer.java
import java.util.regex.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ThreatAnalyzer {
    static String threatData =
        "58.27.82.161@02/10/2005\n" +
        "204.45.234.40@02/11/2005\n" +
        "58.27.82.161@02/11/2005\n" +
        "58.27.82.161@02/12/2005\n" +
        "58.27.82.161@02/12/2005\n" +
        "[Next log section with different data format]";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(threatData);
        String pattern = "(\\d+[.]\\d+[.]\\d+[.]\\d+)@" +
            "(\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4})";
        while (scanner.hasNext(pattern)) {
            scanner.next(pattern);
            MatchResult match = scanner.match();
            String ip = match.group(1);
            String date = match.group(2);
            System.out.format("Threat on %s from %s\n", date, ip);
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Threat on 02/10/2005 from 58.27.82.161
Threat on 02/11/2005 from 204.45.234.40
Threat on 02/11/2005 from 58.27.82.161
Threat on 02/12/2005 from 58.27.82.161
Threat on 02/12/2005 from 58.27.82.161
*///:~
```
When you use next( ) with a specific pattern, that pattern is matched against the next input
token. The result is made available by the match( ) method, and as you can see above, it
works just like the regular expression matching you saw earlier.

There's one caveat when scanning with regular expressions. The pattern is matched against
the next input token only, so if your pattern contains a delimiter it will never be matched.

### ‚òò15.7.3. StringTokenizer
Before regular expressions (in J2SE1.4) or the Scanner class (in Java SE5), the way to split a
string into parts was to "tokenize" it with StringTokenizer. But now it's much easier and
more succinct to do the same thing with regular expressions or the Scanner class. Here's a
simple comparison of StringTokenizer to the other two techniques:

```java
//: strings/ReplacingStringTokenizer.java

import java.util.*;

public class ReplacingStringTokenizer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "But I'm not dead yet! I feel happy!";
        StringTokenizer stoke = new StringTokenizer(input);
        while (stoke.hasMoreElements())
            System.out.print(stoke.nextToken() + " ");
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(input.split(" ")));
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(input);
        while (scanner.hasNext())
            System.out.print(scanner.next() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
But I'm not dead yet! I feel happy!
[But, I'm, not, dead, yet!, I, feel, happy!]
But I'm not dead yet! I feel happy!
*///:~
```
With regular expressions or Scanner objects, you can also split a string into parts using
more complex patterns‚Äîsomething that's difficult with StringTokenizer. It seems safe to
say that the StringTokenizer is obsolete.

## üçÄ15.8 Summary
In the past, Java support for string manipulation was rudimentary, but in recent editions of
the language we've seen far more sophisticated support adopted from other languages. At
this point, the support for strings is reasonably complete, although you must sometimes pay
attention to efficiency details such as the appropriate use of StringBuilder.

# üìú 16. Type Information
Runtime type information (RTTI) allows you to discover and use
type information while a program is running.

It frees you from the constraint of doing type-oriented things only at compile time, and can
enable some very powerful programs. The need for RTTI uncovers a plethora of interesting
(and often perplexing) 0 0 design issues, and raises fundamental questions about how you
should structure your programs. This chapter looks at the ways that Java allows you to
discover information about objects and classes at run time. This takes two forms:

"traditional" RTTI, which assumes that you have all the types available at compile time, and
the reflection mechanism, which allows you to discover and use class information solely at
run time.

## üçÄ16.01. The need for RTTI
Consider the now-familiar example of a class hierarchy that uses polymorphism. The generic
type is the base class Shape, and the specific derived types are Circle, Square, and
Triangle:

This is a typical class hierarchy diagram, with the base class at the top and the derived classes
growing downward. The normal goal in object-oriented programming is for your code to
manipulate references to the base type (Shape, in this case), so if you decide to extend the
program by adding a new class (such as Rhomboid, derived from Shape), the bulk of the
code is not affected. In this example, the dynamically bound method in the Shape interface
is draw( ), so the intent is for the client programmer to call draw( ) through a generic
Shape reference. In all of the derived classes, draw( ) is overridden, and because it is a
dynamically bound method, the proper behavior will occur even though it is called through a
generic Shape reference. That's polymorphism.

Thus, you generally create a specific object (Circle, Square, or Triangle), upcast it to a
Shape (forgetting the specific type of the object), and use that anonymous Shape reference
in the rest of the program.

You might code the Shape hierarchy as follows:

```java
//: typeinfo/Shapes.java
import java.util.*;

abstract class Shape {
    void draw() { System.out.println(this + ".draw()"); }
    abstract public String toString();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    public String toString() { return "Circle"; }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    public String toString() { return "Square"; }
}

class Triangle extends Shape {
    public String toString() { return "Triangle"; }
}

public class Shapes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Shape > shapeList = Arrays.asList(
            new Circle(), new Square(), new Triangle()
        );
        for (Shape shape: shapeList)
            shape.draw();
    }
} /* Output:
Circle.draw()
Square.draw()
Triangle.draw()
*///:~
```
The base class contains a draw( ) method that indirectly uses toString( ) to print an
identifier for the class by passing this to System.out.println( ) (notice that toString( ) is
declared abstract to force inheritors to override it, and to prevent the instantiation of a
plain Shape). If an object appears in a string concatenation expression (involving '+' and
String objects), the toString( ) method is automatically called to produce a String
representation for that object. Each of the derived classes overrides the toString( ) method
(from Object) so that draw( ) ends up (polymorphically) printing something different in
each case.

In this example, the upcast occurs when the shape is placed into the List<Shape>. During
the upcast to Shape, the fact that the objects are specific types of Shape is lost. To the array,
they are just Shapes.

At the point that you fetch an element out of the array, the container‚Äîwhich is actually
holding everything as an Object‚Äîautomatically casts the result back to a Shape. This is the
most basic form of RTTI, because all casts are checked at run time for correctness. That's
what RTTI means: At run time, the type of an object is identified.

In this case, the RTTI cast is only partial: The Object is cast to a Shape, and not all the way
to a Circle, Square, or Triangle. That's because the only thing you know at this point is
that the List<Shape> is full of Shapes. At compile time, this is enforced by the container
and the Java generic system, but at run time the cast ensures it.

Now polymorphism takes over and the exact code that's executed for the Shape is
determined by whether the reference is for a Circle, Square, or Triangle. And in general,
this is how it should be; you want the bulk of your code to know as little as possible about
specific types of objects, and to just deal with the general representation of a family of objects
(in this case, Shape). As a result, your code will be easier to write, read, and maintain, and
your designs will be easier to implement, understand, and change. So polymorphism is a
general goal in object-oriented programming.

But what if you have a special programming problem that's easiest to solve if you know the
exact type of a generic reference? For example, suppose you want to allow your users to
highlight all the shapes of any particular type by turning them a special color. This way, they
can find all the triangles on the screen by highlighting them. Or perhaps your method needs
to "rotate" a list of shapes, but it makes no sense to rotate a circle so you'd like to skip the
circles. With RTTI, you can ask a Shape reference the exact type that it's referring to, and
thus select and isolate special cases.

## üçÄ16.02. The Class object
To understand how RTTI works in Java, you must first know how type information is
represented at run time. This is accomplished through a special kind of object called the
Class object, which contains information about the class. In fact, the Class object is used to
create all of the "regular" objects of your class. Java performs its RTTI using the Class
object, even if you're doing something like a cast. The class Class also has a number of other
ways you can use RTTI.

There's one Class object for each class that is part of your program. That is, each time you
write and compile a new class, a single Class object is also created (and stored, appropriately
enough, in an identically named .class file). To make an object of that class, the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) that's executing your program uses a subsystem called a `class loader`.

The class loader subsystem can actually comprise a chain of class loaders, but there's only
one `primordial class loader`, which is part of the JVM implementation. The primordial class
loader loads so-called `trusted classes`, including Java API classes, typically from the local
disk. It's usually not necessary to have additional class loaders in the chain, but if you have
special needs (such as loading classes in a special way to support Web server applications, or
downloading classes across a network), then you have a way to hook in additional class
loaders.

All classes are loaded into the JVM dynamically, upon the first use of a class. This happens
when the program makes the first reference to a static member of that class. It turns out that
the constructor is also a static method of a class, even though the static keyword is not used
for a constructor. Therefore, creating a new object of that class using the new operator also
counts as a reference to a static member of the class.

Thus, a Java program isn't completely loaded before it begins, but instead pieces of it are
loaded when necessary. This is different from many traditional languages. Dynamic loading
enables behavior that is difficult or impossible to duplicate in a statically loaded language like
C++.

The class loader first checks to see if the Class object for that type is loaded. If not, the
default class loader finds the .class file with that name (an add-on class loader might, for
example, look for the bytecodes in a database instead). As the bytes for the class are loaded,
they are verified to ensure that they have not been corrupted and that they do not comprise
bad Java code (this is one of the lines of defense for security in Java).

Once the Class object for that type is in memory, it is used to create all objects of that type.
Here's a program to prove it:

```java
//: typeinfo/SweetShop.java
// Examination of the way the class loader works.
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Candy {
    static { print("Loading Candy"); }
}


class Gum {
    static { print("Loading Gum"); }
}

class Cookie {
    static { print("Loading Cookie"); }
}

public class SweetShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print("inside main");
        new Candy();
        print("After creating Candy");
        try {
            Class.forName("Gum");
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            print("Couldn't find Gum");
        }
        print("After Class.forName(\"Gum\")");
        new Cookie();
        print("After creating Cookie");
    }
} /* Output:
inside main
Loading Candy
After creating Candy
Loading Gum
After Class.forName("Gum")
Loading Cookie
After creating Cookie
*///:~
```
Each of the classes Candy, Gum, and Cookie has a static clause that is executed as the
class is loaded for the first time. Information will be printed to tell you when loading occurs
for that class. In main( ), the object creations are spread out between print statements to
help detect the time of loading.

You can see from the output that each Class object is loaded only when it's needed, and the
static initialization is performed upon class loading.

A particularly interesting line is:

    Class.forName("Gum");

All Class objects belong to the class Class. A Class object is like any other object, so you
can get and manipulate a reference to it (that's what the loader does). One of the ways to get
a reference to the Class object is the static `forName( )` method, which takes a String
containing the textual name (watch the spelling and capitalization!) of the particular class
you want a reference for. It returns a Class reference, which is being ignored here; the call to
`forName( )` is being made for its side effect, which is to load the class Gum if it isn't already
loaded. In the process of loading, Gum's static clause is executed.

In the preceding example, if `Class.forName( )` fails because it can't find the class you're
trying to load, it will throw a ClassNotFoundException. Here, we simply report the
problem and move on, but in more sophisticated programs, you might try to fix the problem
inside the exception handler.

Anytime you want to use type information at run time, you must first get a reference to the
appropriate Class object. Class.forName( ) is one convenient way to do this, because you
don't need an object of that type in order to get the Class reference. However, if you already
have an object of the type you're interested in, you can fetch the Class reference by calling a
method that's part of the Object root class: `getClass( )`. This returns the Class reference
representing the actual type of the object. Class has many interesting methods; here are a
few of them:

```java
//: typeinfo/toys/ToyTest.java
// Testing class Class.
package typeinfo.toys;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface HasBatteries {}
interface Waterproof {}
interface Shoots {}

class Toy {
    // Comment out the following default constructor
    // to see NoSuchMethodError from (*1*)
    Toy() {}
    Toy(int i) {}
}

class FancyToy extends Toy
implements HasBatteries, Waterproof, Shoots {
    FancyToy() { super(1); }
}

public class ToyTest {
    static void printInfo(Class cc) {
        print("Class name: " + cc.getName() +
            " is interface? [" + cc.isInterface() + "]");
        print("Simple name: " + cc.getSimpleName());
        print("Canonical name : " + cc.getCanonicalName());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class c = null;
        try {
            c = Class.forName("typeinfo.toys.FancyToy");
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            print("Can't find FancyToy");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        printInfo(c);
        for (Class face: c.getInterfaces())
            printInfo(face);
        Class up = c.getSuperclass();
        Object obj = null;
        try {
            // Requires default constructor:
            obj = up.newInstance();
        } catch (InstantiationException e) {
            print("Cannot instantiate");
            System.exit(1);
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            print("Cannot access");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        printInfo(obj.getClass());
    }

FancyToy inherits from Toy and implements the interfaces HasBatteries,
Waterproof, and Shoots. In main( ), a Class reference is created and initialized to the
FancyToy Class using `forName( )` inside an appropriate try block. Notice that you must
use the fully qualified name (including the package name) in the string that you pass to
`forName( )`.

printInfo( ) uses `getName( )` to produce the fully qualified class name, and
`getSimpleName( )` and `getCanonicalName( )` (introduced in Java SE5) to produce the
name without the package, and the fully qualified name, respectively. As its name implies,
`islnterface( )` tells you whether this Class object represents an interface. Thus, with the
Class object you can find out just about everything you want to know about a type.
The `class.getlnterfaces( )` method called in main( ) returns an array of Class objects
representing the interfaces that are contained in the Class object of interest.

If you have a Class object, you can also ask it for its direct base class using `geTsuperclass(
)`. This returns a Class reference that you can further query. Thus you can discover an
object's entire class hierarchy at run time.

The `newlnstance( )` method of Class is a way to implement a "virtual constructor," which
allows you to say, "I don't know exactly what type you are, but create yourself properly
anyway." In the preceding example, up is just a Class reference with no further type
information known at compile time. And when you create a new instance, you get back an
Object reference. But that reference is pointing to a Toy object. Of course, before you can
send any messages other than those accepted by Object, you must investigate it a bit and do
some casting. In addition, the class that's being created with `newlnstance( )` must have a
default constructor. Later in this chapter, you'll see how to dynamically create objects of
classes using any constructor, with the Java reflection API.

Exercise 1: (1) In ToyTest.java, comment out Toy's default constructor and explain
what happens.

Exercise 2: (2) Incorporate a new kind of interface into ToyTest.java and verify that it
is detected and displayed properly.

Exercise 3: (2) Add Rhomboid to Shapes.java. Create a Rhomboid, upcast it to a
Shape, then downcast it back to a Rhomboid. Try downcasting to a Circle and see what
happens.

Exercise 4: (2) Modify the previous exercise so that it uses instanceof to check the type
before performing the downcast.

Exercise 5: (3) Implement a rotate(Shape) method in Shapes.java, such that it
checks to see if it is rotating a Circle (and, if so, doesn't perform the operation).

Exercise 6: (4) Modify Shapes.java so that it can "highlight" (set a flag in) all shapes of
a particular type. The toString( ) method for each derived Shape should indicate whether
that Shape is "highlighted."

Exercise 7: (3) Modify SweetShop.java so that each type of object creation is
controlled by a command-line argument. That is, if your command line is "Java Sweetshop
Candy," then only the Candy object is created. Notice how you can control which Class
objects are loaded via the commandline argument.

Exercise 8: (5) Write a method that takes an object and recursively prints all the classes
in that object's hierarchy.

Exercise 9: (5) Modify the previous exercise so that it uses
Class.getDeclaredFields( ) to also display information about the fields in a class.

Exercise 10: (3) Write a program to determine whether an array of char is a primitive
type or a true Object.

### ‚òò16.02.1. Class literals
Java provides a second way to produce the reference to the Class object: the class literal. In
the preceding program this would look like:

    FancyToy.class;

which is not only simpler, but also safer since it's checked at compile time (and thus does not
need to be placed in a try block). Because it eliminates the `forName( )` method call, it's also
more efficient.

Class literals work with regular classes as well as interfaces, arrays, and primitive types. In
addition, there's a standard field called TYPE that exists for each of the primitive wrapper
classes. The TYPE field produces a reference to the Class object for the associated primitive
type, such that:

| ... is equivalent to  ... |
|---------------------------|
| boolean.class | Boolean.TYPE   |
| char.class    | Character.TYPE |
| byte.class    | Byte.TYPE      |
| short.class   | Short.TYPE     |
| int.class     | Integer.TYPE   |
| long.class    | Long.TYPE      |
| float.class   | Float.TYPE     |
| double.class  | Double.TYPE    |
| void.class    | Void.TYPE      |

My preference is to use the ".class" versions if you can, since they're more consistent with
regular classes.

It's interesting to note that creating a reference to a Class object using ".class" doesn't
automatically initialize the Class object. There are actually three steps in preparing a class
for use:

1. `Loading`, which is performed by the class loader. This finds the bytecodes (usually, but
not necessarily, on your disk in your classpath) and creates a Class object from those
bytecodes.

2. `Linking`. The link phase verifies the bytecodes in the class, allocates storage for static
fields, and if necessary, resolves all references to other classes made by this class.

3. `Initialization`. If there's a superclass, initialize that. Execute static initializers and
static initialization blocks.

Initialization is delayed until the first reference to a `static method` (the constructor is
implicitly static) or to a `non-constant static field`:

```java
//: typeinfo/ClassInitialization.java
import java.util.*;

class Initable {
    static final int staticFinal = 47;
    static final int staticFinal2 =
        ClassInitialization.rand.nextInt(1000);
    static {
        System.out.println("Initializing Initable");
    }
}

class Initable2 {
    static int staticNonFinal = 147;
    static {
        System.out.println("Initializing Initable2");
    }
}

class Initable3 {
    static int staticNonFinal = 74;
    static {
        System.out.println("Initializing Initable3");
    }
}

public class ClassInitialization {
    public static Random rand = new Random(47);
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class initable = Initable.class;
        System.out.println("After creating Initable ref");
        // Does not trigger initialization:
        System.out.println(Initable.staticFinal);
        // Does trigger initialization:
        System.out.println(Initable.staticFinal2);
        // Does trigger initialization:
        System.out.println(Initable2.staticNonFinal);
        Class initable3 = Class.forName("Initable3");
        System.out.println("After creating Initable3 ref");
        System.out.println(Initable3.staticNonFinal);
    }
} /* Output:
After creating Initable ref
47

Initializing Initable
258
Initializing Initable2
147
Initializing Initable3
After creating Initable3 ref
74
*///:~
```
Effectively, initialization is "as lazy as possible." From the creation of the initable reference,
you can see that just using the .class syntax to get a reference to the class doesn't cause
initialization. However, Class.forName( ) initializes the class immediately in order to
produce the Class reference, as you can see in the creation of initable3.

If a static final value is a "compile-time constant," such as Initable.staticFinal, that
value can be read without causing the Initable class to be initialized. Making a field static
and final, however, does not guarantee this behavior: accessing Initable.staticFinal2
forces class initialization because it cannot be a compile-time constant.

If a static field is not final, accessing it always requires linking (to allocate storage for the
field) and initialization (to initialize that storage) before it can be read, as you can see in the
access to Initable2.staticNonFinal.

### ‚òò16.02.2. Generic class references
A Class reference points to a Class object, which manufactures instances of classes and
contains all the method code for those instances. It also contains the statics for that class. So
a Class reference really does indicate the exact type of what it's pointing to: an object of the
class Class.

However, the designers of Java SE5 saw an opportunity to make this a bit more specific by
allowing you to constrain the type of Class object that the Class reference is pointing to,
using the generic syntax. In the following example, both syntaxes are correct:

```java
//: typeinfo/GenericClassReferences.java

public class GenericClassReferences {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class intClass = int.class;
        Class<Integer> genericIntClass = int.class;
        genericIntClass = Integer.class; // Same thing
        intClass = double.class;
        // genericIntClass = double.class; // Illegal
    }
} ///:~
```
The ordinary class reference does not produce a warning. However, you can see that the
ordinary class reference can be reassigned to any other Class object, whereas the generic
class reference can only be assigned to its declared type. By using the generic syntax, you
allow the compiler to enforce extra type checking.

What if you'd like to loosen the constraint a little? Initially, it seems like you ought to be able
to do something like:

    Class<Number> genericNumberClass = int.class;

This would seem to make sense because Integer is inherited from Number. But this
doesn't work, because the Integer Class object is not a subclass of the Number Class

object (this may seem like a subtle distinction; we'll look into it more deeply in the Generics
chapter).

To loosen the constraints when using generic Class references, I employ the wildcard, which
is part of Java generics. The wildcard symbol is '?', and it indicates "anything." So we can add
wildcards to the ordinary Class reference in the above example and produce the same
results:

```java
//: typeinfo/WildcardClassReferences.java

public class WildcardClassReferences {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class<?> intClass = int.class;
        intClass = double.class;
    }
} ///:~
```
In Java SE5, `Class<?>` is preferred over plain Class, even though they are equivalent and
the plain Class, as you saw, doesn't produce a compiler warning. The benefit of `Class<?>` is
that it indicates that you aren't just using a non-specific class reference by accident, or out of
ignorance. You chose the non-specific version.

In order to create a Class reference that is constrained to a type or any subtype, you
combine the wildcard with the extends keyword to create a bound. So instead of just saying
Class<Number>, you say:

```java
//: typeinfo/BoundedClassReferences.java

public class BoundedClassReferences {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class<? extends Number> bounded = int.class;
        bounded = double.class;
        bounded = Number.class;
        // Or anything else derived from Number.
    }
} ///:~
```
The reason for adding the generic syntax to Class references is only to provide compile-time
type checking, so that if you do something wrong you find out about it a little sooner. You
can't actually go astray with ordinary Class references, but if you make a mistake you won't
find out until run time, which can be inconvenient.

Here's an example that uses the generic class syntax. It stores a class reference, and later
produces a List filled with objects that it generates using newlnstance( ):

```java
//: typeinfo/FilledList.java
import java.util.*;

class CountedInteger {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public String toString() { return Long.toString(id); }
}

public class FilledList < T > {
    private Class < T > type;
    public FilledList(Class < T > type) { this.type = type; }
    public List < T > create(int nElements) {
        List < T > result = new ArrayList < T > ();
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < nElements; i++)
                result.add(type.newInstance());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FilledList < CountedInteger > fl =
            new FilledList < CountedInteger > (CountedInteger.class);
        System.out.println(fl.create(15));
    }
} /* Output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
*///:~
```
Notice that this class must assume that any type that it works with has a default constructor
(one without arguments), and you'll get an exception if that isn't the case. The compiler does
not issue any warnings for this program.

An interesting thing happens when you use the generic syntax for Class objects:
newlnstance( ) will return the exact type of the object, rather than just a basic Object as
you saw in ToyTest.java. This is somewhat limited:

```java
//: typeinfo/toys/GenericToyTest.java
// Testing class Class.
package typeinfo.toys;

public class GenericToyTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class<FancyToy> ftClass = FancyToy.class;
        // Produces exact type:
        FancyToy fancyToy = ftClass.newInstance();
        Class<? super FancyToy> up = ftClass.getSuperclass();
        // This won't compile:
        // Class<Toy> up2 = ftClass.getSuperclass();
        // Only produces Object:
        Object obj = up.newInstance();
    }
} ///:~
```
If you get the superclass, the compiler will only allow you to say that the superclass reference
is "some class that is a superclass of FancyToy" as seen in the expression Class <? super
FancyToy >. It will not accept a declaration of Class<Toy>. This seems a bit strange
because getSuperclass( ) returns the base class (not interface) and the compiler knows
what that class is at compile time‚Äîin this case, Toy.class, not just "some superclass of
FancyToy." In any event, because of the vagueness, the return value of up.newlnstance( )
is not a precise type, but just an Object.

### ‚òò16.02.3. New cast syntax
Java SE5 also adds a casting syntax for use with Class references, which is the cast( )
method:

```java
//: typeinfo/ClassCasts.java

class Building {}
class House extends Building {}


public class ClassCasts {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Building b = new House();
        Class<House> houseType = House.class;
        House h = houseType.cast(b);
        h = (House)b; // ... or just do this.
    }
} ///:~
```
The cast( ) method takes the argument object and casts it to the type of the Class reference.
Of course, if you look at the above code it seems like a lot of extra work compared to the last
line in main( ), which does the same thing.

The new casting syntax is useful for situations where you can't just use an ordinary cast. This
usually happens when you're writing generic code (which you'll learn about in the Generics
chapter), and you've stored a Class reference that you want to use to cast with at a later time.
It turns out to be a rare thing‚ÄîI found only one instance where cast( ) was used in the entire
Java SE5 library (it was in com.sun.mirror.util.DeclarationFilter).

Another new feature had no usage in the Java SE5 library: Class.asSubclass( ). This allows
you to cast the class object to a more specific type.

## üçÄ16.03. Checking before a cast
So far, you've seen forms of RTTI, including:
1. The classic cast; e.g., "(Shape)," which uses RTTI to make sure the cast is correct.
This will throw a ClassCastException if you've performed a bad cast.

2. The Class object representing the type of your object. The Class object can be
queried for useful runtime information.

In C++, the classic cast "(Shape)" does not perform RTTI. It simply tells the compiler to
treat the object as the new type. In Java, which does perform the type check, this cast is often
called a "type-safe downcast." The reason for the term "downcast" is the historical
arrangement of the class hierarchy diagram. If casting a Circle to a Shape is an upcast, then
casting a Shape to a Circle is a downcast. However, because it knows that a Circle is also a
Shape, the compiler freely allows an upcast assignment, without requiring any explicit cast
syntax. The compiler cannot know, given a Shape, what that Shape actually is‚Äîit could be
exactly a Shape, or it could be a subtype of Shape, such as a Circle, Square, Triangle or
some other type. At compile time, the compiler only sees a Shape. Thus, it won't allow you to
perform a downcast assignment without using an explicit cast, to tell it that you have extra
information that allows you to know that it is a particular type (the compiler will check to see
if that downcast is reasonable, so it won't let you downcast to a type that's not actually a
subclass).

There's a third form of RTTI in Java. This is the keyword instanceof, which tells you if an
object is an instance of a particular type. It returns a boolean so you use it in the form of a
question, like this:

    if(x instanceof Dog)
        ((Dog)x).bark();

The if statement checks to see if the object x belongs to the class Dog before casting x to a
Dog. It's important to use instanceof before a downcast when you don't have other
information that tells you the type of the object; otherwise, you'll end up with a
ClassCastException.

Ordinarily, you might be hunting for one type (triangles to turn purple, for example), but you
can easily tally all of the objects by using instanceof. For example, suppose you have a
family of classes to describe Pets (and their people, a feature which will come in handy in a
later example). Each Individual in the hierarchy has an id and an optional name. Although
the classes that follow inherit from Individual, there are some complexities in the
Individual class, so that code will be shown and explained in the Containers in Depth
chapter. As you can see, it's not really necessary to see the code for Individual at this
point‚Äîyou only need to know that you can create it with or without a name, and that each
Individual has a method id( ) that returns a unique identifier (created by counting each
object). There's also a toString( ) method; if you don't provide a name for an Individual,
toString( ) only produces the simple type name.

Here is the class hierarchy that inherits from Individual:

```java
//: typeinfo/pets/Person.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Person extends Individual {
    public Person(String name) { super(name); }
} ///:~

//: typeinfo/pets/Pet.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Pet extends Individual {
    public Pet(String name) { super(name); }
    public Pet() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Dog.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Dog extends Pet {
    public Dog(String name) { super(name); }
    public Dog() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Mutt.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Mutt extends Dog {
    public Mutt(String name) { super(name); }
    public Mutt() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Pug.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Pug extends Dog {
    public Pug(String name) { super(name); }
    public Pug() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Cat.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Cat extends Pet {
    public Cat(String name) { super(name); }
    public Cat() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/EgyptianMau.java

package typeinfo.pets;

public class EgyptianMau extends Cat {
    public EgyptianMau(String name) { super(name); }
    public EgyptianMau() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Manx.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Manx extends Cat {
    public Manx(String name) { super(name); }
    public Manx() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Cymric.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Cymric extends Manx {
    public Cymric(String name) { super(name); }
    public Cymric() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Rodent.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Rodent extends Pet {
    public Rodent(String name) { super(name); }
    public Rodent() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Rat.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Rat extends Rodent {
    public Rat(String name) { super(name); }
    public Rat() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Mouse.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Mouse extends Rodent {
    public Mouse(String name) { super(name); }
    public Mouse() { super(); }
} ///:~


//: typeinfo/pets/Hamster.java
package typeinfo.pets;

public class Hamster extends Rodent {
    public Hamster(String name) { super(name); }
    public Hamster() { super(); }
} ///:~
```
Next, we need a way to randomly create different types of pets, and for convenience, to create
arrays and Lists of pets. To allow this tool to evolve through several different
implementations, we'll define it as an abstract class:

```java
//: typeinfo/pets/PetCreator.java
// Creates random sequences of Pets.
package typeinfo.pets;

import java.util.*;

public abstract class PetCreator {
    private Random rand = new Random(47);
    // The List of the different types of Pet to create:
    public abstract List < Class < ? extends Pet >> types();
    public Pet randomPet() { // Create one random Pet
        int n = rand.nextInt(types().size());
        try {
            return types().get(n).newInstance();
        } catch (InstantiationException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
    public Pet[] createArray(int size) {
        Pet[] result = new Pet[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            result[i] = randomPet();
        return result;
    }
    public ArrayList < Pet > arrayList(int size) {
        ArrayList < Pet > result = new ArrayList < Pet > ();
        Collections.addAll(result, createArray(size));
        return result;
    }
} ///:~
```
The abstract getTypes( ) method defers to a derived class to get the List of Class objects
(this is a variation of the Template Method design pattern). Notice that the type of class is
specified to be "anything derived from Pet," so that newlnstance( ) produces a Pet without
requiring a cast. randomPet( ) randomly indexes into the List and uses the selected Class
object to generate a new instance of that class with Class.newlnstance( ). The
createArray( ) method uses randomPet( ) to fill an array, and arrayList( ) uses
createArray( ) in turn.

You can get two kinds of exceptions when calling newlnstance( ). You can see these
handled in the catch clauses following the try block. Again, the names of the exceptions are
relatively useful explanations of what went wrong (IllegalAccessException relates to a
violation of the Java security mechanism, in this case if the default constructor is private).
When you derive a subclass of PetCreator, the only thing you need to supply is the List of
the types of pet that you want to create using randomPet( ) and the other methods. The
getTypes( ) method will normally just return a reference to a static List. Here's an
implementation using forName( ):

```java
//: typeinfo/pets/ForNameCreator.java
package typeinfo.pets;
import java.util.*;

public class ForNameCreator extends PetCreator {
    private static List < Class < ? extends Pet >> types =
        new ArrayList < Class < ? extends Pet >> ();
    // Types that you want to be randomly created:
    private static String[] typeNames = {
        "typeinfo.pets.Mutt",
        "typeinfo.pets.Pug",
        "typeinfo.pets.EgyptianMau",
        "typeinfo.pets.Manx",
        "typeinfo.pets.Cymric",
        "typeinfo.pets.Rat",
        "typeinfo.pets.Mouse",
        "typeinfo.pets.Hamster"
    };
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private static void loader() {
        try {
            for (String name: typeNames)
                types.add(
                    (Class < ? extends Pet > ) Class.forName(name));
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
    static { loader(); }
    public List < Class < ? extends Pet >> types() { return types; }
} ///:~
```
The loader( ) method creates the List of Class objects using Class.forName( ). This may
generate a ClassNotFoundException, which makes sense since you're passing it a String
which cannot be validated at compile time. Since the Pet objects are in package typeinfo,
the package name must be used when referring to the classes.

In order to produce a typed List of Class objects, a cast is required, which produces a
compile-time warning. The loader( ) method is defined separately and then placed inside a
static initialization clause because the @SuppressWarnings annotation cannot be placed
directly onto the static initialization clause. To count Pets, we need a tool that keeps track of
the quantities of various different types of Pets. A Map is perfect for this; the keys are the Pet
type names and the values are Integers to hold the Pet quantities. This way, you can say,
"How many Hamster objects are there?" We can use instanceof to count Pets:

```java
//: typeinfo/PetCount.java
// Using instanceof.
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PetCount {
    static class PetCounter extends HashMap < String, Integer > {
        public void count(String type) {
            Integer quantity = get(type);
            if (quantity == null)
                put(type, 1);
            else
                put(type, quantity + 1);
        }
    }
    public static void
    countPets(PetCreator creator) {
        PetCounter counter = new PetCounter();
        for (Pet pet: creator.createArray(20)) {
            // List each individual pet:
            printnb(pet.getClass().getSimpleName() + " ");
            if (pet instanceof Pet)
                counter.count("Pet");
            if (pet instanceof Dog)
                counter.count("Dog");
            if (pet instanceof Mutt)
                counter.count("Mutt");
            if (pet instanceof Pug)
                counter.count("Pug");
            if (pet instanceof Cat)
                counter.count("Cat");
            if (pet instanceof Manx)
                counter.count("EgyptianMau");
            if (pet instanceof Manx)
                counter.count("Manx");
            if (pet instanceof Manx)
                counter.count("Cymric");
            if (pet instanceof Rodent)
                counter.count("Rodent");
            if (pet instanceof Rat)
                counter.count("Rat");
            if (pet instanceof Mouse)
                counter.count("Mouse");
            if (pet instanceof Hamster)
                counter.count("Hamster");
        }
        // Show the counts:
        print();
        print(counter);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        countPets(new ForNameCreator());
    }
} /* Output:

In countPets( ), an array is randomly filled with Pets using a PetCreator. Then each Pet
in the array is tested and counted using instanceof. There's a rather narrow restriction on
instanceof: You can compare it to a named type only, and not to a Class object. In the
preceding example you might feel that it's tedious to write out all of those instanceof
expressions, and you're right. But there is no way to cleverly automate instanceof by
creating an array of Class objects and comparing it to those instead (stay tuned‚Äîyou'll see
an alternative). This isn't as great a restriction as you might think, because you'll eventually
understand that your design is probably flawed if you end up writing a lot of instanceof
expressions.

### ‚òò16.03.1. Using class literals
If we reimplement the PetCreator using class literals, the result is cleaner in many ways:

```java
//: typeinfo/pets/LiteralPetCreator.java
// Using class literals.
package typeinfo.pets;
import java.util.*;

public class LiteralPetCreator extends PetCreator {
    // No try block needed.
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static final List < Class < ? extends Pet >> allTypes =
        Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(
            Pet.class, Dog.class, Cat.class, Rodent.class,
            Mutt.class, Pug.class, EgyptianMau.class, Manx.class,
            Cymric.class, Rat.class, Mouse.class, Hamster.class));
    // Types for random creation:
    private static final List < Class < ? extends Pet >> types =
        allTypes.subList(allTypes.indexOf(Mutt.class),

            allTypes.size());
    public List < Class < ? extends Pet >> types() {
        return types;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(types);
    }
} /* Output:
[class typeinfo.pets.Mutt, class typeinfo.pets.Pug, class
typeinfo.pets.EgyptianMau, class typeinfo.pets.Manx, class
typeinfo.pets.Cymric, class typeinfo.pets.Rat, class
typeinfo.pets.Mouse, class typeinfo.pets.Hamster]
*///:~
```
In the upcoming PetCount3.java example, we need to pre-load a Map with all the Pet
types (not just the ones that are to be randomly generated), so the allTypes List is
necessary. The types list is the portion of allTypes (created using List.subList( )) that
includes the exact pet types, so it is used for random Pet generation.

This time, the creation of types does not need to be surrounded by a try block since it's
evaluated at compile time and thus won't throw any exceptions, unlike Class.forName( ).
We now have two implementations of PetCreator in the typeinfo.pets library. In order to
provide the second one as a default implementation, we can create a Faqade that utilizes
LiteralPetCreator:

```java
//: typeinfo/pets/Pets.java
// Facade to produce a default PetCreator.
package typeinfo.pets;
import java.util.*;

public class Pets {
    public static final PetCreator creator =
        new LiteralPetCreator();
    public static Pet randomPet() {
        return creator.randomPet();
    }
    public static Pet[] createArray(int size) {
        return creator.createArray(size);
    }
    public static ArrayList<Pet> arrayList(int size) {
        return creator.arrayList(size);
    }
} ///:~
```
This also provides indirection to randomPet( ), createArray( ) and arrayList( ).
Because PetCount.countPets( ) takes a PetCreator argument, we can easily test the
LiteralPetCreator (via the above Facade):

```java
//: typeinfo/PetCount2.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;

public class PetCount2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PetCount.countPets(Pets.creator);
    }
} /* (Execute to see output) *///:~
```
The output is the same as that of PetCount.java.

### ‚òò16.03.2. A dynamic instanceof
The Class.islnstance( ) method provides a way to dynamically test the type of an object.
Thus, all those tedious instanceof statements can be removed from PetCount.java:

```java
//: typeinfo/PetCount3.java
// Using isInstance()
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PetCount3 {
    static class PetCounter
    extends LinkedHashMap < Class < ? extends Pet > , Integer > {
        public PetCounter() {
            super(MapData.map(LiteralPetCreator.allTypes, 0));
        }
        public void count(Pet pet) {
            // Class.isInstance() eliminates instanceofs:
            for (Map.Entry < Class < ? extends Pet > , Integer > pair :
                entrySet())
                if (pair.getKey().isInstance(pet))
                    put(pair.getKey(), pair.getValue() + 1);
        }
        public String toString() {
            StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("{");
            for (Map.Entry < Class < ? extends Pet > , Integer > pair :
                entrySet()) {
                result.append(pair.getKey().getSimpleName());
                result.append("=");
                result.append(pair.getValue());
                result.append(", ");
            }
            result.delete(result.length() - 2, result.length());
            result.append("}");
            return result.toString();
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PetCounter petCount = new PetCounter();
        for (Pet pet: Pets.createArray(20)) {
            printnb(pet.getClass().getSimpleName() + " ");
            petCount.count(pet);
        }
        print();
        print(petCount);
    }
} /* Output:
Rat Manx Cymric Mutt Pug Cymric Pug Manx Cymric Rat EgyptianMau Hamster
EgyptianMau Mutt Mutt Cymric Mouse Pug Mouse Cymric
{Pet=20, Dog=6, Cat=9, Rodent=5, Mutt=3, Pug=3, EgyptianMau=2, Manx=7,
Cymric=5, Rat=2, Mouse=2, Hamster=1}
*///:~
```
In order to count all the different types of Pet, the PetCounter Map is preloaded with the
types from LiteralPetCreator.allTypes. This uses the net.mindview.util.MapData
class, which takes an Iterable (the allTypes List) and a constant value (zero, in this case),
and fills the Map with keys taken from allTypes and values of zero). Without pre-loading
the Map, you would only end up counting the types that are randomly generated, and not the
base types like Pet and Cat.

You can see that the isInstance( ) method has eliminated the need for the instanceof
expressions. In addition, this means that you can add new types of Pet simply by changing
the LiteralPetCreator.types array; the rest of the program does not need modification (as
it did when using the instanceof expressions).

The toString( ) method has been overloaded for easier-to-read output that still matches the
typical output that you see when printing a Map.

### ‚òò16.03.3. Counting recursively
The Map in PetCount3.PetCounter was pre-loaded with all the different Pet classes. Instead of
pre-loading the map, we can use `Class.isAssignableFrom( )` and create a general-purpose tool
that is not limited to counting Pets:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/TypeCounter.java
// Counts instances of a type family.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.*;

public class TypeCounter extends HashMap < Class < ? > , Integer > {
    private Class < ? > baseType;
    public TypeCounter(Class < ? > baseType) {
        this.baseType = baseType;
    }
    public void count(Object obj) {
        Class < ? > type = obj.getClass();
        if (!baseType.isAssignableFrom(type))
            throw new RuntimeException(obj + " incorrect type: " +
                type + ", should be type or subtype of " +
                baseType);
        countClass(type);
    }
    private void countClass(Class < ? > type) {
        Integer quantity = get(type);
        put(type, quantity == null ? 1 : quantity + 1);
        Class < ? > superClass = type.getSuperclass();
        if (superClass != null &&
            baseType.isAssignableFrom(superClass))
            countClass(superClass);
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder("{");
        for (Map.Entry < Class < ? > , Integer > pair : entrySet()) {
            result.append(pair.getKey().getSimpleName());
            result.append("=");
            result.append(pair.getValue());
            result.append(", ");
        }
        result.delete(result.length() - 2, result.length());
        result.append("}");
        return result.toString();
    }
} ///:~
```
The count( ) method gets the Class of its argument, and uses isAssignableFrom( ) to
perform a runtime check to verify that the object that you've passed actually belongs to the
hierarchy of interest. countClass( ) first counts the exact type of the class. Then, if
baseType is assignable from the superclass, countClass( ) is called recursively on the
superclass.


```java
//: typeinfo/PetCount4.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class PetCount4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TypeCounter counter = new TypeCounter(Pet.class);
        for (Pet pet: Pets.createArray(20)) {
            printnb(pet.getClass().getSimpleName() + " ");
            counter.count(pet);
        }
        print();
        print(counter);
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
Rat Manx Cymric Mutt Pug Cymric Pug Manx Cymric Rat EgyptianMau Hamster
EgyptianMau Mutt Mutt Cymric Mouse Pug Mouse Cymric
{Mouse=2, Dog=6, Manx=7, EgyptianMau=2, Rodent=5, Pug=3, Mutt=3,
Cymric=5, Cat=9, Hamster=1, Pet=20, Rat=2}
*///:~
```
As you can see from the output, both base types as well as exact types are counted.

Exercise 11: (2) Add Gerbil to the typeinfo.pets library and modify all the examples in
this chapter to adapt to this new class.

Exercise 12: (3) Use TypeCounter with the CoffeeGenerator.java class in the Generics
chapter.

Exercise 13: (3) Use TypeCounter with the RegisteredFactories.java example in this
chapter.

## üçÄ16.04. Registered factories
A problem with generating objects of the Pets hierarchy is the fact that every time you add a
new type of Pet to the hierarchy you must remember to add it to the entries in
LiteralPetCreator.java. In a system where you add more classes on a regular basis this
can become problematic.

You might think of adding a static initializer to each subclass, so that the initializer would
add its class to a list somewhere. Unfortunately, static initializers are only called when the
class is first loaded, so you have a chicken-and-egg problem: The generator doesn't have the
class in its list, so it can never create an object of that class, so the class won't get loaded and
placed in the list.

Basically, you're forced to create the list yourself, by hand (unless you want to write a tool
that searches through and analyzes your source code, then creates and compiles the list). So
the best you can probably do is to put the list in one central, obvious place. The base class for
the hierarchy of interest is probably the best place.

The other change we'll make here is to defer the creation of the object to the class itself, using
the Factory Method design pattern. A factory method can be called polymorphically, and
creates an object of the appropriate type for you. In this very simple version, the factory
method is the create( ) method in the Factory interface:

```java
//: typeinfo/factory/Factory.java
package typeinfo.factory;
public interface Factory<T> { T create(); } ///:~
```

The generic parameter T allows create( ) to return a different type for each implementation
of Factory. This also makes use of covariant return types. In this example, the base class
Part contains a List of factory objects. Factories for types that should be produced by the
createRandom( ) method are "registered" with the base class by adding them to the
partFactories List:

```java
//: typeinfo/RegisteredFactories.java
// Registering Class Factories in the base class.
import typeinfo.factory.*;
import java.util.*;

class Part {
    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    static List < Factory < ? extends Part >> partFactories =
        new ArrayList < Factory < ? extends Part >> ();
    static {
        // Collections.addAll() gives an "unchecked generic
        // array creation ... for varargs parameter" warning.
        partFactories.add(new FuelFilter.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new AirFilter.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new CabinAirFilter.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new OilFilter.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new FanBelt.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new PowerSteeringBelt.Factory());
        partFactories.add(new GeneratorBelt.Factory());
    }
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    public static Part createRandom() {
        int n = rand.nextInt(partFactories.size());
        return partFactories.get(n).create();
    }
}

class Filter extends Part {}

class FuelFilter extends Filter {
    // Create a Class Factory for each specific type:
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < FuelFilter > {
        public FuelFilter create() { return new FuelFilter(); }
    }
}

class AirFilter extends Filter {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < AirFilter > {
        public AirFilter create() { return new AirFilter(); }
    }
}

class CabinAirFilter extends Filter {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < CabinAirFilter > {
        public CabinAirFilter create() {
            return new CabinAirFilter();
        }

    }
}

class OilFilter extends Filter {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < OilFilter > {
        public OilFilter create() { return new OilFilter(); }
    }
}

class Belt extends Part {}

class FanBelt extends Belt {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < FanBelt > {
        public FanBelt create() { return new FanBelt(); }
    }
}

class GeneratorBelt extends Belt {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < GeneratorBelt > {
        public GeneratorBelt create() {
            return new GeneratorBelt();
        }
    }
}

class PowerSteeringBelt extends Belt {
    public static class Factory
    implements typeinfo.factory.Factory < PowerSteeringBelt > {
        public PowerSteeringBelt create() {
            return new PowerSteeringBelt();
        }
    }
}

public class RegisteredFactories {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            System.out.println(Part.createRandom());
    }
} /* Output:
GeneratorBelt
CabinAirFilter
GeneratorBelt
AirFilter
PowerSteeringBelt
CabinAirFilter
FuelFilter
PowerSteeringBelt
PowerSteeringBelt
FuelFilter
*///:~
```
Not all classes in the hierarchy should be instantiated; in this case Filter and Belt are just
classifiers so you do not create an instance of either one, but only of their subclasses. If a
class should be created by createRandom( ), it contains an inner Factory class. The only
way to reuse the name Factory as seen above is by qualifying typeinfo.factory.Factory.
Although you can use Collections.addAll( ) to add the factories to the list, the compiler
expresses its unhappiness with a warning about a "generic array creation" (which is supposed

to be impossible, as you'll see in the Generics chapter), so I reverted to calling add( ). The
createRandom( ) method randomly selects a factory object from partFactories and calls
its create( ) to produce a new Part.

Exercise 14: (4) A constructor is a kind of factory method. Modify
RegisteredFactories.java so that instead of using an explicit factory, the class object is
stored in the List, and newlnstance( ) is used to create each object.

Exercise 15: (4) Implement a new PetCreator using Registered Factories, and modify
the Pets Facade so that it uses this one instead of the other two. Ensure that the rest of the
examples that use Pets .Java still work correctly.

Exercise 16: (4) Modify the Coffee hierarchy in the Generics chapter to use Registered
Factories.

## üçÄ16.05. instanceof vs. Class equivalence
When you are querying for type information, there's an important difference between either
form of instanceof (that is, instanceof or `isInstance( )`, which produce equivalent
results) and the direct comparison of the Class objects. Here's an example that demonstrates
the difference:

```java
//: typeinfo/FamilyVsExactType.java
// The difference between instanceof and class
package typeinfo;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {}

public class FamilyVsExactType {
    static void test(Object x) {
        print("Testing x of type " + x.getClass());
        print("x instanceof Base " + (x instanceof Base));
        print("x instanceof Derived " + (x instanceof Derived));
        print("Base.isInstance(x) " + Base.class.isInstance(x));
        print("Derived.isInstance(x) " +
            Derived.class.isInstance(x));
        print("x.getClass() == Base.class " +
            (x.getClass() == Base.class));
        print("x.getClass() == Derived.class " +
            (x.getClass() == Derived.class));
        print("x.getClass().equals(Base.class)) " +
            (x.getClass().equals(Base.class)));
        print("x.getClass().equals(Derived.class)) " +
            (x.getClass().equals(Derived.class)));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(new Base());
        test(new Derived());
    }
} /* Output:
Testing x of type class typeinfo.Base
x instanceof Base true
x instanceof Derived false
Base.isInstance(x) true
Derived.isInstance(x) false
x.getClass() == Base.class true
x.getClass() == Derived.class false
x.getClass().equals(Base.class)) true
x.getClass().equals(Derived.class)) false
Testing x of type class typeinfo.Derived
x instanceof Base true
x instanceof Derived true
Base.isInstance(x) true
Derived.isInstance(x) true
x.getClass() == Base.class false
x.getClass() == Derived.class true
x.getClass().equals(Base.class)) false
x.getClass().equals(Derived.class)) true
*///:~
```
The test( ) method performs type checking with its argument using both forms of
instanceof. It then gets the Class reference and uses == and equals( ) to test for equality
of the Class objects. Reassuringly, instanceof and islnstance( ) produce exactly the same
results, as do equals( ) and ==. But the tests themselves draw different conclusions. In
keeping with the concept of type, instanceof says, "Are you this class, or a class derived
from this class?" On the other hand, if you compare the actual Class objects using ==, there
is no concern with inheritance‚Äîit's either the exact type or it isn't.

## üçÄ16.06. Reflection: runtime class information
If you don't know the precise type of an object, RTTI will tell you. However, there's a
limitation: The type must be known at compile time in order for you to detect it using RTTI
and to do something useful with the information. Put another way, the compiler must know
about all the classes you're working with.

This doesn't seem like that much of a limitation at first, but suppose you're given a reference
to an object that's not in your program space. In fact, the class of the object isn't even
available to your program at compile time. For example, suppose you get a bunch of bytes
from a disk file or from a network connection, and you're told that those bytes represent a
class. Since this class shows up long after the compiler generates the code for your program,
how can you possibly use such a class?

In a traditional programming environment, this seems like a far-fetched scenario. But as we
move into a larger programming world, there are important cases in which this happens. The
first is component-based programming, in which you build projects using Rapid Application
Development (RAD) in an Application Builder Integrated Development Environment, which
I shall refer to simply as an IDE. This is a visual approach to creating a program by moving
icons that represent components onto a form. These components are then configured by
setting some of their values at program time. This design-time configuration requires that
any component be instantiable, that it exposes parts of itself, and that it allows its properties
to be read and modified. In addition, components that handle Graphical User Interface
(GUI) events must expose information about appropriate methods so that the IDE can assist
the programmer in overriding these event-handling methods. Reflection provides the
mechanism to detect the available methods and produce the method names. Java provides a
structure for component-based programming through JavaBeans (described in the
Graphical User Interfaces chapter).

Another compelling motivation for discovering class information at run time is to provide the
ability to create and execute objects on remote platforms, across a network. This is called
Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and it allows a Java program to have objects distributed
across many machines. This distribution can happen for a number of reasons. For example,
perhaps you're doing a computation-intensive task, and in order to speed things up, you want
to break it up and put pieces on machines that are idle. In other situations you might want to

place code that handles particular types of tasks (e.g., "Business Rules" in a multitier
client/server architecture) on a particular machine, so the machine becomes a common
repository describing those actions, and it can be easily changed to affect everyone in the
system. (This is an interesting development, since the machine exists solely to make software
changes easy!) Along these lines, distributed computing also supports specialized hardware
that might be good at a particular task‚Äîmatrix inversions, for example‚Äîbut inappropriate or
too expensive for generalpurpose programming.

The class Class supports the concept of reflection, along with the java.lang.reflect library
which contains the classes Field, Method, and Constructor (each of which implements
the Member interface). Objects of these types are created by the JVM at run time to
represent the corresponding member in the unknown class. You can then use the
Constructors to create new objects, the `get( )` and `set( )` methods to read and modify the
fields associated with Field objects, and the `invoke( )` method to call a method associated
with a Method object. In addition, you can call the convenience methods `geTfields( )`,
`geTmethods( )`, `geTconstructors( )`, etc., to return arrays of the objects representing the
fields, methods, and constructors. (You can find out more by looking up the class Class in
the JDK documentation.) Thus, the class information for anonymous objects can be
completely determined at run time, and nothing need be known at compile time.

It's important to realize that there's nothing magic about reflection. When you're using
reflection to interact with an object of an unknown type, the JVM will simply look at the
object and see that it belongs to a particular class (just like ordinary RTTI). Before anything
can be done with it, the Class object must be loaded. Thus, the .class file for that particular
type must still be available to the JVM, either on the local machine or across the network. So
the true difference between RTTI and reflection is that with RTTI, the compiler opens and
examines the .class file at compile time. Put another way, you can call all the methods of an
object in the "normal" way. With reflection, the .class file is unavailable at compile time; it is
opened and examined by the runtime environment.

### ‚òò16.06.1. A class method extractor
Normally you won't need to use the reflection tools directly, but they can be helpful when you
need to create more dynamic code. Reflection is in the language to support other Java
features, such as object serialization and JavaBeans (both covered later in the book).
However, there are times when it's quite useful to dynamically extract information about a
class.

Consider a class method extractor. Looking at a class definition source code or JDK
documentation shows only the methods that are defined or overridden within that class
definition. But there might be dozens more available to you that have come from base
classes. To locate these is both tedious and time consuming. ¬π Fortunately, reflection provides
a way to write a simple tool that will automatically show you the entire interface. Here's the
way it works:

¬π Especially in the past. However, Sun has greatly improved its HTML Java documentation 
so that it's easier to see base-class methods.


```java
//: typeinfo/ShowMethods.java
// Using reflection to show all the methods of a class,
// even if the methods are defined in the base class.
// {Args: ShowMethods}

public class ShowMethods {
    private static String usage =

        "ShowMethods qualified.class.name\n" +
        "To show all methods in class or:\n" +
        "ShowMethods qualified.class.name word\n" +
        "To search for methods involving 'word'";
    private static Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\w+\\.");
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length < 1) {
            print(usage);
            System.exit(0);
        }
        int lines = 0;
        try {
            Class < ? > c = Class.forName(args[0]);
            Method[] methods = c.getMethods();

The Class methods `geTmethods( )` and `geTconstructors( )` return an array of Method
and array of Constructor, respectively. Each of these classes has further methods to dissect
the names, arguments, and return values of the methods they represent. But you can also just
use `tOstring( )`, as is done here, to produce a String with the entire method signature. The
rest of the code extracts the command-line information, determines if a particular signature
matches your target string (using `indeXof( )`), and strips off the name qualifiers using
regular expressions (introduced in the Strings chapter).

The result produced by `class.foRname( )` cannot be known at compile time, and therefore
all the method signature information is being extracted at run time. If you investigate the
JDK reflection documentation, you'll see that there is enough support to actually set up and
make a method call on an object that's totally unknown at compile time (there will be
examples of this later in this book). Although initially this is something you may not think
you'll ever need, the value of full reflection can be quite surprising.
The output above is produced from the command line:

    java ShowMethods ShowMethods

You can see that the output includes a public default constructor, even though no
constructor was defined. The constructor you see is the one that's automatically synthesized
by the compiler. If you then make ShowMethods a non-public class (that is, package
access), the synthesized default constructor no longer shows up in the output. The
synthesized default constructor is automatically given the same access as the class.
Another interesting experiment is to invoke Java ShowMethods java.lang.String with
an extra argument of char, int, String, etc.

This tool can be a real time-saver while you're programming, when you can't remember if a
class has a particular method and you don't want to go hunting through the index or class
hierarchy in the JDK documentation, or if you don't know whether that class can do anything
with, for example, Color objects.

The Graphical User Interfaces chapter contains a GUI version of this program (customized
to extract information for Swing components) so you can leave it running while you're
writing code, to allow quick lookups.

Exercise 17: (2) Modify the regular expression in ShowMethods.java to additionally
strip off the keywords native and final (hint: use the OR operator'|')-

Exercise 18: (1) Make ShowMethods a non-public class and verify that the
synthesized default constructor no longer shows up in the output.

Exercise 19: (4) In ToyTest.java, use reflection to create a Toy object using the non-
default constructor.

Exercise 20: (5) Look up the interface for java.lang.Class in the JDK documentation
from http://java.sun.com. Write a program that takes the name of a class as a command-line
argument, then uses the Class methods to dump all the information available for that class.
Test your program with a standard library class and a class you create.

## üçÄ16.07. Dynamic proxies
Proxy is one of the basic design patterns. It is an object that you insert in place of the "real"
object in order to provide additional or different operations‚Äîthese usually involve
communication with a "real" object, so a proxy typically acts as a go-between. Here's a trivial
example to show the structure of a proxy:

```java
//: typeinfo/SimpleProxyDemo.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Interface {
    void doSomething();
    void somethingElse(String arg);
}

class RealObject implements Interface {
    public void doSomething() { print("doSomething"); }
    public void somethingElse(String arg) {
        print("somethingElse " + arg);
    }
}

class SimpleProxy implements Interface {
    private Interface proxied;
    public SimpleProxy(Interface proxied) {
        this.proxied = proxied;
    }
    public void doSomething() {
        print("SimpleProxy doSomething");
        proxied.doSomething();
    }
    public void somethingElse(String arg) {
        print("SimpleProxy somethingElse " + arg);
        proxied.somethingElse(arg);
    }
}

class SimpleProxyDemo {
    public static void consumer(Interface iface) {
        iface.doSomething();
        iface.somethingElse("bonobo");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        consumer(new RealObject());
        consumer(new SimpleProxy(new RealObject()));
    }
} /* Output:
doSomething
somethingElse bonobo
SimpleProxy doSomething
doSomething
SimpleProxy somethingElse bonobo
somethingElse bonobo
*///:~
```
Because consumer( ) accepts an Interface, it can't know if it's getting a RealObject or a
SimpleProxy, because both implement Interface. But the SimpleProxy inserted
between the client and the RealObject performs operations and then calls the identical
method on a RealObject.

A proxy can be helpful anytime you'd like to separate extra operations into a different place
than the "real object," and especially when you want to easily change from not using the extra
operations to using them, and vice versa (the point of design patterns is to encapsulate
change‚Äîso you need to be changing things in order to justify the pattern). For example, what
if you wanted to track calls to the methods in the RealObject, or to measure the overhead of
such calls? This is not code you want to have incorporated in your application, so a proxy
allows you to add and remove it easily.

Java's dynamic proxy takes the idea of a proxy one step further, by both creating the proxy
object dynamically and handling calls to the proxied methods dynamically. All calls made on a
dynamic proxy are redirected to a single invocation handler, which has the job of discovering
what the call is and deciding what to do about it. Here's SimpleProxyDemo.java rewritten to
use a dynamic proxy:


```java
//: typeinfo/SimpleDynamicProxy.java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

class DynamicProxyHandler implements InvocationHandler {
    private Object proxied;
    public DynamicProxyHandler(Object proxied) {
        this.proxied = proxied;
    }
    public Object
    invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args)
    throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("**** proxy: " + proxy.getClass() +
            ", method: " + method + ", args: " + args);
        if (args != null)
            for (Object arg: args)
                System.out.println(" " + arg);
        return method.invoke(proxied, args);
    }
}

class SimpleDynamicProxy {
    public static void consumer(Interface iface) {
        iface.doSomething();
        iface.somethingElse("bonobo");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RealObject real = new RealObject();
        consumer(real);
        // Insert a proxy and call again:
        Interface proxy = (Interface) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            Interface.class.getClassLoader(),
            new Class[] { Interface.class },
            new DynamicProxyHandler(real));
        consumer(proxy);
    }
} /* Output: (95% match)
doSomething
somethingElse bonobo
**** proxy: class $Proxy0, method: public abstract void
Interface.doSomething(), args: null
doSomething
**** proxy: class $Proxy0, method: public abstract void
Interface.somethingElse(java.lang.String), args:
[Ljava.lang.Object;@42e816
bonobo
somethingElse bonobo
*///:~
```
You create a dynamic proxy by calling the static method `Proxy.newProxyInstance( )`,
which requires a class loader (you can generally just hand it a class loader from an object that
has already been loaded), a list of interfaces (not classes or abstract classes) that you wish the
proxy to implement, and an implementation of the interface InvocationHandler. The
dynamic proxy will redirect all calls to the invocation handler, so the constructor for the
invocation handler is usually given the reference to the "real" object so that it can forward
requests once it performs its intermediary task.

```java
public static Object newProxyInstance(ClassLoader loader,
                              Class<?>[] interfaces,
                              InvocationHandler h)
        throws IllegalArgumentException
```

The `invoke( )` method is handed the proxy object, in case you need to distinguish where the
request came from‚Äîbut in many cases you won't care. However, be careful when calling
methods on the proxy inside `invoke( )`, because calls through the interface are redirected
through the proxy.

In general you will perform the proxied operation and then use `Method.invoke( )` to
forward the request to the proxied object, passing the necessary arguments. This may initially
seem limiting, as if you can only perform generic operations. However, you can filter for
certain method calls, while passing others through:

```java
//: typeinfo/SelectingMethods.java
// Looking for particular methods in a dynamic proxy.
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class MethodSelector implements InvocationHandler {
    private Object proxied;
    public MethodSelector(Object proxied) {
        this.proxied = proxied;
    }
    public Object
    invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args)
    throws Throwable {
        if (method.getName().equals("interesting"))
            print("Proxy detected the interesting method");
        return method.invoke(proxied, args);
    }
}

interface SomeMethods {
    void boring1();
    void boring2();
    void interesting(String arg);
    void boring3();
}

class Implementation implements SomeMethods {
    public void boring1() { print("boring1"); }
    public void boring2() { print("boring2"); }
    public void interesting(String arg) {
        print("interesting " + arg);
    }
    public void boring3() { print("boring3"); }
}

class SelectingMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SomeMethods proxy = (SomeMethods) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            SomeMethods.class.getClassLoader(),
            new Class[] { SomeMethods.class },
            new MethodSelector(new Implementation()));
        proxy.boring1();
        proxy.boring2();
        proxy.interesting("bonobo");
        proxy.boring3();
    }
} /* Output:
boring1
boring2
Proxy detected the interesting method
interesting bonobo
boring3
*///:~
```
Here, we are just looking for method names, but you could also be looking for other aspects
of the method signature, and you could even search for particular argument values.

The dynamic proxy is not a tool that you'll use every day, but it can solve certain types of
problems very nicely. You can learn more about Proxy and other design patterns in Thinking
in Patterns (see www.MindView.net) and Design Patterns, by Erich Gamma et al. (Addison-
Wesley, 1995).

Exercise 21: (3) Modify SimpleProxyDemo.java so that it measures method-call
times.

Exercise 22: (3) Modify SimpleDynamicProxy.java so that it measures method-call
times.

Exercise 23: (3) Inside invoke( ) in SimpleDynamicProxy.java, try to print the
proxy argument and explain what happens.

Project: ¬≤  Write a system using dynamic proxies to implement transactions, where the proxy
performs a commit if the proxied call is successful (doesn't throw any exceptions) and a
rollback if it fails. Your commit and rollback should work on an external text file, which is
outside the control of Java exceptions. You will have to pay attention to the atomicity of
operations.

## üçÄ16.08. Null Objects
When you use the built-in null to indicate the absence of an object, you must test a reference
for null-ness every time you use it. This can get very tedious and produce ponderous code.
The problem is that null has no behavior of its own except for producing a
NullPointerException if you try to do anything with it. Sometimes it is useful to introduce
the idea of a Null Object ¬≥ that will accept messages for the object that it's "standing in" for,
but will return values indicating that no "real" object is actually there. This way, you can
assume that all objects are valid and you don't have to waste programming time checking for
null (and reading the resulting code).

¬≥ Discovered by Bobby Woolf and Bruce Anderson. This can be seen as a special case of the 
Strategy pattern. A variant of Null Object is the Null Iterator pattern, which makes iteration 
over the nodes in a composite hierarchy transparent to the client (the client can then use the same
logic for iterating over the composite and leaf nodes).

Although it's fun to imagine a programming language that would automatically create Null
Objects for you, in practice it doesn't make sense to use them everywhere‚Äîsometimes
checking for null is fine, and sometimes you can reasonably assume that you won't
encounter null, and sometimes even detecting aberrations via NullPointerException is
acceptable. The place where Null Objects seem to be most useful is "closer to the data," with
objects that represent entities in the problem space. As a simple example, many systems will
have a Person class, and there are situations in the code where you don't have an actual
person (or you do, but you don't have all the information about that person yet), so
traditionally you'd use a null reference and test for it. Instead, we can make a Null Object.
But even though the Null Object will respond to all messages that the "real" object will
respond to, you still need a way to test for nullness. The simplest way to do this is to create a
tagging interface:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Null.java
package net.mindview.util;
public interface Null {} ///:~
```

This allows instanceof to detect the Null Object, and more importantly, does not require
you to add an isNull( ) method to all your classes (which would be, after all, just a different
way of performing RTTI‚Äîwhy not use the built-in facility instead?).

```java
//: typeinfo/Person.java
// A class with a Null Object.
import net.mindview.util.*;

class Person {
    public final String first;
    public final String last;
    public final String address;
    // etc.
    public Person(String first, String last, String address) {
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
        this.address = address;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "Person: " + first + " " + last + " " + address;
    }
    public static class NullPerson
    extends Person implements Null {
        private NullPerson() { super("None", "None", "None"); }
        public String toString() { return "NullPerson"; }
    }
    public static final Person NULL = new NullPerson();
} ///:~
```
In general, the Null Object will be a Singleton, so here it is created as a static final instance.
This works because Person is immutable‚Äîyou can only set the values in the constructor,
and then read those values, but you can't modify them (because Strings themselves are
inherently immutable). If you want to change a NullPerson, you can only replace it with a
new Person object. Notice that you have the option of detecting the generic Null or the
more specific NullPerson using instanceof, but with the Singleton approach you can also
just use equals( ) or even == to compare to Person.NULL.

Now suppose you're back in the high-flying days of Internet startups and you've been given a
big pile of venture funding for your Amazing Idea. You're ready to staff up, but while you're
waiting for positions to be filled, you can use Person Null Objects as placeholders for each
Position:

```java
//: typeinfo/Position.java

class Position {
    private String title;
    private Person person;
    public Position(String jobTitle, Person employee) {
        title = jobTitle;
        person = employee;
        if (person == null)
            person = Person.NULL;
    }
    public Position(String jobTitle) {
        title = jobTitle;
        person = Person.NULL;
    }
    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    public void setTitle(String newTitle) {
        title = newTitle;
    }

    public Person getPerson() { return person; }
    public void setPerson(Person newPerson) {
        person = newPerson;
        if (person == null)
            person = Person.NULL;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "Position: " + title + " " + person;
    }
} ///:~
```
With Position, we don't need to make a Null Object because the existence of
Person.NULL implies a null Position (it's possible that, later, you'll discover the need to
add an explicit Null Object for Position, but YAGNI ‚Å¥ (You Aren't Going to Need It) says to
try "the simplest thing that could possibly work" for your first draft, and to wait until some
aspect of the program requires you to add in the extra feature, rather than assuming it's
necessary).

‚Å¥ A tenet of Extreme Programming(XP), as is "Do the simplest thing that could possibly work."

The Staff class can now look for Null Objects when you are filling positions:

```java
//: typeinfo/Staff.java
import java.util.*;

public class Staff extends ArrayList < Position > {
    public void add(String title, Person person) {
        add(new Position(title, person));
    }
    public void add(String...titles) {
        for (String title: titles)
            add(new Position(title));
    }
    public Staff(String...titles) { add(titles); }
    public boolean positionAvailable(String title) {
        for (Position position: this)
            if (position.getTitle().equals(title) &&
                position.getPerson() == Person.NULL)
                return true;
        return false;
    }
    public void fillPosition(String title, Person hire) {
        for (Position position: this)
            if (position.getTitle().equals(title) &&
                position.getPerson() == Person.NULL) {
                position.setPerson(hire);
                return;
            }
        throw new RuntimeException(
            "Position " + title + " not available");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Staff staff = new Staff("President", "CTO",
            "Marketing Manager", "Product Manager",
            "Project Lead", "Software Engineer",
            "Software Engineer", "Software Engineer",
            "Software Engineer", "Test Engineer",
            "Technical Writer");
        staff.fillPosition("President",
            new Person("Me", "Last", "The Top, Lonely At"));
        staff.fillPosition("Project Lead",
            new Person("Janet", "Planner", "The Burbs"));
        if (staff.positionAvailable("Software Engineer"))
            staff.fillPosition("Software Engineer",
                new Person("Bob", "Coder", "Bright Light City"));
        System.out.println(staff);
    }
} /* Output:

Notice that you must still test for Null Objects in some places, which is not that different
from checking for null, but in other places (such as toString( ) conversions, in this case),
you don't have to perform extra tests; you can just assume that all object references are valid.
If you are working with interfaces instead of concrete classes, it's possible to use a
DynamicProxy to automatically create the Null Objects. Suppose we have a Robot
interface that defines a name, model, and a List < Operation > that describes what the
Robot is capable of doing. Operation contains a description and a command (it's a type of
Command pattern):

```java
//: typeinfo/Operation.java

public interface Operation {
String description();
void command();
} ///:~
```
You can access a Robot's services by calling operations( ):

```java
//: typeinfo/Robot.java
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public interface Robot {
    String name();
    String model();
    List < Operation > operations();
    class Test {
        public static void test(Robot r) {
            if (r instanceof Null)
                System.out.println("[Null Robot]");
            System.out.println("Robot name: " + r.name());
            System.out.println("Robot model: " + r.model());
            for (Operation operation: r.operations()) {
                System.out.println(operation.description());
                operation.command();
            }
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
This also incorporates a nested class to perform tests.
We can now create a Robot that removes snow:


```java
//: typeinfo/SnowRemovalRobot.java
import java.util.*;

public class SnowRemovalRobot implements Robot {
    private String name;
    public SnowRemovalRobot(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String name() { return name; }
    public String model() { return "SnowBot Series 11"; }
    public List < Operation > operations() {
        return Arrays.asList(
            new Operation() {
                public String description() {
                    return name + " can shovel snow";
                }
                public void command() {
                    System.out.println(name + " shoveling snow");
                }
            },
            new Operation() {
                public String description() {
                    return name + " can chip ice";
                }
                public void command() {
                    System.out.println(name + " chipping ice");
                }
            },
            new Operation() {
                public String description() {
                    return name + " can clear the roof";
                }
                public void command() {
                    System.out.println(name + " clearing roof");
                }
            }

There will presumably be many different types of Robot, and we'd like to have each Null
Object do something special for each Robot type‚Äîin this case, incorporate information
about the exact type of Robot the Null Object is standing for. This information will be

    private String nullName;
    private Robot proxied = new NRobot();
    NullRobotProxyHandler(Class < ? extends Robot > type) {
        nullName = type.getSimpleName() + " NullRobot";

    private class NRobot implements Null, Robot {

Whenever you need a null Robot object, you just call newNullRobot( ), passing the type of
Robot you want a proxy for. The proxy fulfills the requirements of the Robot and Null
interfaces, and provides the specific name of the type that it proxies.

### ‚òò16.08.1. Mock Objects & Stubs
Logical variations of the Null Object are the MocA: Object and the Stub. Like Null Object,
both of these are stand-ins for the "real" object that will be used in the finished program.
However, both Mock Object and Stub pretend to be live objects that deliver real information,
rather than being a more intelligent placeholder for null, as Null Object is.

The distinction between Mock Object and Stub is one of degree. Mock Objects tend to be
lightweight and self-testing, and usually many of them are created to handle various testing
situations. Stubs just return stubbed data, are typically heavyweight and are often reused
between tests. Stubs can be configured to change depending on how they are called. So a Stub
is a sophisticated object that does lots of things, whereas you usually create lots of small,
simple Mock Objects if you need to do many things.

Exercise 24: (4) Add Null Objects to RegisteredFactories.java.

## üçÄ16.09. Interfaces and type information
An important goal of the interface keyword is to allow the programmer to isolate
components, and thus reduce coupling. If you write to interfaces, you accomplish this, but
with type information it's possible to get around that‚Äî interfaces are not airtight guarantees
of decoupling. Here's an example, starting with an interface:

```java
//: typeinfo/interfacea/A.java
package typeinfo.interfacea;

public interface A {
    void f();
} ///:~
```
This interface is then implemented, and you can see how to sneak around to the actual
implementation type:

```java
//: typeinfo/InterfaceViolation.java
// Sneaking around an interface.
import typeinfo.interfacea.*;

class B implements A {
    public void f() {}
    public void g() {}
}

public class InterfaceViolation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new B();
        a.f();
        // a.g(); // Compile error
        System.out.println(a.getClass().getName());
        if (a instanceof B) {
            B b = (B) a;
            b.g();
        }
    }
} /* Output:
B
*///:~
```
Using RTTI, we discover that a has been implemented as a B. By casting to B, we can call a
method that's not in A.

This is perfectly legal and acceptable, but you may not want client programmers to do this,
because it gives them an opportunity to couple more closely to your code than you'd like.
That is, you may think that the interface keyword is protecting you, but it isn't, and the fact
that you're using B to implement A in this case is effectively a matter of public record. ‚Åµ
One solution is to simply say that programmers are on their own if they decide to use the
actual class rather than the interface. This is probably reasonable in many cases, but if
"probably" isn't enough, you might want to apply more stringent controls.

‚Åµ The most famous case of this is the Windows operating system, which had a published API 
that you were supposed to write to, and an unpublished but visible set of functions that you 
could discover and call. To solve problems, programmers used the hidden API functions, which 
forced Microsoft to maintain them as if they were part of the public API. This became a 
source of great cost and effort for the company.

The easiest approach is to use package access for the implementation, so that clients outside
the package may not see it:

```java
//: typeinfo/packageaccess/HiddenC.java
package typeinfo.packageaccess;
import typeinfo.interfacea.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class C implements A {
    public void f() { print("public C.f()"); }
    public void g() { print("public C.g()"); }
    void u() { print("package C.u()"); }
    protected void v() { print("protected C.v()"); }
    private void w() { print("private C.w()"); }
}

public class HiddenC {
    public static A makeA() { return new C(); }
}///:~
```
The only public part of this package, HiddenC, produces an A interface when you call it.
What's interesting about this is that even if you were to return a C from makeA( ), you still
couldn't use anything but an A from outside the package, since you cannot name C outside
the package.

Now if you try to downcast to C, you can't do it because there is no 'C type available outside the
package:

```java
//: typeinfo/HiddenImplementation.java
// Sneaking around package access.
import typeinfo.interfacea.*;
import typeinfo.packageaccess.*;
import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class HiddenImplementation {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        A a = HiddenC.makeA();
        a.f();
        System.out.println(a.getClass().getName());
        // Compile error: cannot find symbol 'C':
        /* if(a instanceof C) {
        C c = (C)a;
        c.g();
        } */
        // Oops! Reflection still allows us to call g():
        callHiddenMethod(a, "g");
        // And even methods that are less accessible!
        callHiddenMethod(a, "u");
        callHiddenMethod(a, "v");
        callHiddenMethod(a, "w");
    }
    static void callHiddenMethod(Object a, String methodName)
    throws Exception {
        Method g = a.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(methodName);
        g.setAccessible(true);
        g.invoke(a);
    }
} /* Output:
public C.f()
typeinfo.packageaccess.C
public C.g()
package C.u()
protected C.v()
private C.w()
*///:~
```
As you can see, it's still possible to reach in and call all of the methods using reflection, even
private methods! If you know the name of the method, you can call setAccessible(true)
on the Method object to make it callable, as seen in callHiddenMethod( ).

You may think that you can prevent this by only distributing compiled code, but that's no
solution. All you must do is run javap, which is the decompiler that comes with the JDK.

Here's the command line:

    javap -private C

The -private flag indicates that all members should be displayed, even private ones. Here's
the output:

```java
class typeinfo.packageaccess.C extends
java.lang.Object implements typeinfo.interfacea.A {
    typeinfo.packageaccess.C();
    public void f();
    public void g();
    void u();
    protected void v();
    private void w();
}
```

So anyone can get the names and signatures of your most private methods, and call them.
What if you implement the interface as a private inner class? Here's what it looks like:

```java
//: typeinfo/InnerImplementation.java
// Private inner classes can't hide from reflection.
import typeinfo.interfacea.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class InnerA {
    private static class C implements A {
        public void f() { print("public C.f()"); }
        public void g() { print("public C.g()"); }
        void u() { print("package C.u()"); }
        protected void v() { print("protected C.v()"); }
        private void w() { print("private C.w()"); }
    }

    public static A makeA() { return new C(); }
}

public class InnerImplementation {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        A a = InnerA.makeA();
        a.f();
        System.out.println(a.getClass().getName());
        // Reflection still gets into the private class:
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "g");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "u");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "v");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "w");
    }
} /* Output:
public C.f()
InnerA$C
public C.g()
package C.u()
protected C.v()
private C.w()
*///:~
```

That didn't hide anything from reflection. What about an anonymous class?

```java
//: typeinfo/AnonymousImplementation.java
// Anonymous inner classes can't hide from reflection.
import typeinfo.interfacea.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class AnonymousA {
    public static A makeA() {
        return new A() {
                public void f() { print("public C.f()"); }
                public void g() { print("public C.g()"); }
                void u() { print("package C.u()"); }
                protected void v() { print("protected C.v()"); }
                private void w() { print("private C.w()"); }
        };
    }
}

public class AnonymousImplementation {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        A a = AnonymousA.makeA();
        a.f();
        System.out.println(a.getClass().getName());
        // Reflection still gets into the anonymous class:
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "g");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "u");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "v");
        HiddenImplementation.callHiddenMethod(a, "w");
    }
} /* Output:
public C.f()
AnonymousA$1
public C.g()
package C.u()
protected C.v()
private C.w()
*///:~
```

There doesn't seem to be any way to prevent reflection from reaching in and calling methods
that have non-public access. This is also true for fields, even private fields:

```java
//: typeinfo/ModifyingPrivateFields.java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

class WithPrivateFinalField {
    private int i = 1;
    private final String s = "I'm totally safe";
    private String s2 = "Am I safe?";
    public String toString() {
        return "i = " + i + ", " + s + ", " + s2;
    }
}

public class ModifyingPrivateFields {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        WithPrivateFinalField pf = new WithPrivateFinalField();
        System.out.println(pf);
        Field f = pf.getClass().getDeclaredField("i");
        f.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println("f.getInt(pf): " + f.getInt(pf));
        f.setInt(pf, 47);
        System.out.println(pf);
        f = pf.getClass().getDeclaredField("s");
        f.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println("f.get(pf): " + f.get(pf));
        f.set(pf, "No, you're not!");
        System.out.println(pf);
        f = pf.getClass().getDeclaredField("s2");
        f.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println("f.get(pf): " + f.get(pf));
        f.set(pf, "No, you're not!");
        System.out.println(pf);
    }
} /* Output:
i = 1, I'm totally safe, Am I safe?
f.getInt(pf): 1
i = 47, I'm totally safe, Am I safe?
f.get(pf): I'm totally safe
i = 47, I'm totally safe, Am I safe?
f.get(pf): Am I safe?
i = 47, I'm totally safe, No, you're not!
*///:~
```
However, final fields are actually safe from change. The runtime system accepts any
attempts at change without complaint, but nothing actually happens.

In general, all these access violations are not the worst thing in the world. If someone uses
such a technique to call methods that you marked with private or package access (thus
clearly indicating they should not call them), then it's difficult for them to complain if you
change some aspect of those methods. On the other hand, the fact that you always have a
back door into a class may allow you to solve certain types of problems that could otherwise
be difficult or impossible, and the benefits of reflection in general are undeniable.

Exercise 25: (2) Create a class containing private, protected and package-access
methods. Write code to access these methods from outside of the class's package.


## üçÄ16.10 Summary
RTTI allows you to discover type information from an anonymous base-class reference. Thus,
it's ripe for misuse by the novice, since it might make sense before polymorphic method calls
do. For people coming from a procedural background, it's difficult not to organize programs
into sets of switch statements. You can accomplish this with RTTI and thus lose the
important value of polymorphism in code development and maintenance. The intent of 0 0
programming is to use polymorphic method calls everywhere you can, and RTTI only when
you must.

However, using polymorphic method calls as they are intended requires that you have
control of the base-class definition, because at some point in the extension of your program
you might discover that the base class doesn't include the method you need. If the base class
comes from someone else's library, one solution is RTTI: You can inherit a new type and add
your extra method. Elsewhere in the code you can detect your particular type and call that
special method. This doesn't destroy the polymorphism and extensibility of the program,
because adding a new type will not require you to hunt for switch statements in your
program. However, when you add code that requires your new feature, you must use RTTI to
detect your particular type.

Putting a feature in a base class might mean that, for the benefit of one particular class, all of
the other classes derived from that base require some meaningless stub of a method. This
makes the interface less clear and annoys those who must override abstract methods when
they derive from that base class. For example, consider a class hierarchy representing
musical instruments. Suppose you want to clear the spit valves of all the appropriate
instruments in your orchestra. One option is to put a clearSpitValve( ) method in the base
class Instrument, but this is confusing because it implies that Percussion, Stringed and
Electronic instruments also have spit valves. RTTI provides a much more reasonable
solution because you can place the method in the specific class where it's appropriate (Wind,
in this case). At the same time, you may discover that there's a more sensible solution‚Äîhere,
a preparelnstrument( ) method in the base class. However, you might not see such a
solution when you're first solving the problem and could mistakenly assume that you must
use RTTI.

Finally, RTTI will sometimes solve efficiency problems. Suppose your code nicely uses
polymorphism, but it turns out that one of your objects reacts to this general-purpose code in
a horribly inefficient way. You can pick out that type using RTTI and write case-specific code
to improve the efficiency. Be wary, however, of programming for efficiency too soon. It's a
seductive trap. It's best to get the program working/jrsf, then decide if it's running fast
enough, and only then should you attack efficiency issues‚Äîwith a profiler (see the
supplement at http://MindView.net/Books/BetterJava).

We've also seen that reflection opens up a new world of programming possibilities by
allowing a much more dynamic style of programming. There are some for whom the dynamic
nature of reflection is disturbing. The fact that you can do things that can only be checked at
run time and reported with exceptions seems, to a mind grown comfortable with the security
of static type checking, to be the wrong direction. Some people go so far as to say that
introducing the possibility of a runtime exception is a clear indicator that such code should
be avoided. I find that this sense of security is an illusionthere are always things that can
happen at run time and throw exceptions, even in a program that contains no try blocks or
exception specifications. Instead, I think that the existence of a consistent error-reporting
model empowers us to write dynamic code using reflection. Of course it's worth trying to
write code that can be statically checked ... when you can. But I believe that dynamic code is
one of the important facilities that separate Java from languages like C++.

# üìú 17. Generics
Ordinary classes and methods work with specific types: either
primitives or class types. If you are writing code that might be used
across more types, this rigidity can be overconstraining. ¬π

¬π Angelika Langer's Java Generics FAQ (see www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html) 
as well as her other writings (together with Klaus Kreft) have been invaluable during the preparation 
of this chapter.

One way that object-oriented languages allow generalization is through polymorphism. You
can write (for example) a method that takes a base class object as an argument, and then use
that method with any class derived from that base class. Now your method is a little more
general and can be used in more places. The same is true within classes‚Äîanyplace you use a
specific type, a base type provides more flexibility. Of course, anything but a final class ¬≤
can be extended, so this flexibility is automatic much of the time.

¬≤ Or a class with all private constructors.

Sometimes, being constrained to a single hierarchy is too limiting. If a method argument is
an interface instead of a class, the limitations are loosened to include anything that
implements the interface‚Äîincluding classes that haven't been created yet. This gives the
client programmer the option of implementing an interface in order to conform to your class
or method. So interfaces allow you to cut across class hierarchies, as long as you have the
option to create a new class in order to do so.

Sometimes even an interface is too restrictive. An interface still requires that your code work
with that particular interface. You could write even more general code if you could say that
your code works with "some unspecified type," rather than a specific interface or class.
This is the concept of generics, one of the more significant changes in Java SE5. Generics
implement the concept of parameterized types, which allow multiple types. The term
"generic" means "pertaining or appropriate to large groups of classes." The original intent of
generics in programming languages was to allow the programmer the greatest amount of
expressiveness possible when writing classes or methods, by loosening the constraints on the
types that those classes or methods work with. As you will see in this chapter, the Java
implementation of generics is not that broad reaching‚Äîindeed, you may question whether
the term "generic" is even appropriate for this feature.

If you've never seen any kind of parameterized type mechanism before, Java generics will
probably seem like a convenient addition to the language. When you create an instance of a
parameterized type, casts will be taken care of for you and the type correctness will be
ensured at compile time. This seems like an improvement.

However, if you've had experience with a parameterized type mechanism, in C++, for
example, you will find that you can't do everything that you might expect when using Java
generics. While using someone else's generic type is fairly easy, when creating your own you
will encounter a number of surprises. One of the things I shall try to explain is how the
feature came to be like it is.

This is not to say that Java generics are useless. In many cases they make code more
straightforward and even elegant. But if you're coming from a language that has
implemented a more pure version of generics, you may be disappointed. In this chapter, we
will examine both the strengths and the limitations of Java generics so that you can use this
new feature more effectively.

## üçÄ17.1. Comparison with C++
The Java designers stated that much of the inspiration for the language came as a reaction to
C++. Despite this, it is possible to teach Java largely without reference to C++, and I have
endeavored to do so except when the comparison will give you greater depth of
understanding.

Generics require more comparison with C++ for two reasons. First, understanding certain
aspects of C++ templates (the main inspiration for generics, including the basic syntax) will
help you understand the foundations of the concept, as well as‚Äîand this is very important‚Äî
the limitations of what you can do with Java generics and why. The ultimate goal is to give
you a clear understanding of where the boundaries lie, because my experience is that by
understanding the boundaries, you become a more powerful programmer. By knowing what
you can't do, you can make better use of what you can do (partly because you don't waste
time bumping up against walls).

The second reason is that there is significant misunderstanding in the Java community about
C++ templates, and this misunderstanding may further confuse you about the intent of
generics.

So although I will introduce a few C++ template examples in this chapter, I will keep them to
a minimum.

## üçÄ17.2. Simple generics
One of the most compelling initial motivations for generics is to create container classes,
which you saw in the Holding Your Objects chapter (you'll learn more about these in the
Containers in Depth chapter). A container is a place to hold objects while you're working
with them. Although this is also true of arrays, containers tend to be more flexible and have
different characteristics than simple arrays. Virtually all programs require that you hold a
group of objects while you use them, so containers are one of the most reusable of class
libraries.

Let's look at a class that holds a single object. Of course, the class could specify the exact type
of the object, like this:

```java
//: generics/Holder1.java

class Automobile {}

public class Holder1 {
    private Automobile a;
    public Holder1(Automobile a) { this.a = a; }
    Automobile get() { return a; }
} ///:~
```
But this is not a very reusable tool, since it can't be used to hold anything else. We would
prefer not to write a new one of these for every type we encounter.
Before Java SE5, we would simply make it hold an Object:

```java
//: generics/Holder2.java

public class Holder2 {
    private Object a;
    public Holder2(Object a) { this.a = a; }

    public void set(Object a) { this.a = a; }
    public Object get() { return a; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Holder2 h2 = new Holder2(new Automobile());
        Automobile a = (Automobile)h2.get();
        h2.set("Not an Automobile");
        String s = (String)h2.get();
        h2.set(1); // Autoboxes to Integer
        Integer x = (Integer)h2.get();
    }
} ///:~
```
Now a Holder2 can hold anything‚Äîand in this example, a single Holder2 holds three
different types of objects.

There are some cases where you want a container to hold multiple types of objects, but
typically you only put one type of object into a container. One of the primary motivations for
generics is to specify what type of object a container holds, and to have that specification
backed up by the compiler.

So instead of Object, we'd like to use an unspecified type, which can be decided at a later
time. To do this, you put a type parameter inside angle brackets after the class name, and
then substitute an actual type when you use the class. For the "holder" class, it looks like this,
where T is the type parameter:

```java
//: generics/Holder3.java

public class Holder3<T> {
    private T a;
    public Holder3(T a) { this.a = a; }
    public void set(T a) { this.a = a; }
    public T get() { return a; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Holder3<Automobile> h3 =
        new Holder3<Automobile>(new Automobile());
        Automobile a = h3.get(); // No cast needed
        // h3.set("Not an Automobile"); // Error
        // h3.set(1); // Error
    }
} ///:~
```
Now when you create a Holders, you must specify what type you want to put into it using
the same angle-bracket syntax, as you can see in main( ). You are only allowed to put objects
of that type (or a subtype, since the substitution principle still works with generics) into the
holder. And when you get a value out, it is automatically the right type.

That's the core idea of Java generics: You tell it what type you want to use, and it takes care of
the details.

In general, you can treat generics as if they are any other type‚Äîthey just happen to have type
parameters. But as you'll see, you can use generics just by naming them along with their type
argument list.

Exercise 1: (1) Use Holders with the typeinfo.pets library to show that a Holders
that is specified to hold a base type can also hold a derived type.

Exercise 2: (1) Create a holder class that holds three objects of the same type, along with
the methods to store and fetch those objects and a constructor to initialize all three.

### ‚òò17.2.1. A tuple library
One of the things you often want to do is return multiple objects from a method call. The
return statement only allows you to specify a single object, so the answer is to create an
object that holds the multiple objects that you want to return. Of course, you can write a
special class every time you encounter the situation, but with generics it's possible to solve
the problem once and save yourself the effort in the future. At the same time, you are
ensuring compile-time type safety.

This concept is called a tuple, and it is simply a group of objects wrapped together into a
single object. The recipient of the object is allowed to read the elements but not put new ones
in. (This concept is also called a Data Transfer Object (or Messenger.)

Tuples can typically be any length, but each object in the tuple can be of a different type.
However, we want to specify the type of each object and ensure that when the recipient reads
the value, they get the right type. To deal with the problem of multiple lengths, we create
multiple different tuples. Here's one that holds two objects:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/TwoTuple.java
package net.mindview.util;

public class TwoTuple<A,B> {
    public final A first;
    public final B second;
    public TwoTuple(A a, B b) { first = a; second = b; }
    public String toString() {
        return "(" + first + ", " + second + ")";
    }
} ///:~
```
The constructor captures the object to be stored, and toString( ) is a convenience function
to display the values in a list. Note that a tuple implicitly keeps its elements in order.
Upon first reading, you may think that this could violate common safety principles of Java
programming. Shouldn't first and second be private, and only accessed with methods
named getFirst( ) and getSecond( )? Consider the safety that you would get in that case:
Clients could still read the objects and do whatever they want with them, but they could not
assign first or second to anything else. The final declaration buys you the same safety, but
the above form is shorter and simpler.

Another design observation is that you might want to allow a client programmer to point
first or second to another object. However, it's safer to leave it in the above form, and just
force the user to create a new TwoTuple if they want one that has different elements.
The longer-length tuples can be created with inheritance. You can see that adding more type
parameters is a simple matter:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/ThreeTuple.java
package net.mindview.util;

public class ThreeTuple<A,B,C> extends TwoTuple<A,B> {
    public final C third;
    public ThreeTuple(A a, B b, C c) {
        super(a, b);
        third = c;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "(" + first + ", " + second + ", " + third +")";
    }
} ///:~


//: net/mindview/util/FourTuple.java
package net.mindview.util;

public class FourTuple<A,B,C,D> extends ThreeTuple<A,B,C> {
    public final D fourth;
    public FourTuple(A a, B b, C c, D d) {
        super(a, b, c);
        fourth = d;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "(" + first + ", " + second + ", " +
        third + ", " + fourth + ")";
    }
} ///:~


//: net/mindview/util/FiveTuple.java
package net.mindview.util;

public class FiveTuple<A,B,C,D,E>
extends FourTuple<A,B,C,D> {
    public final E fifth;
    public FiveTuple(A a, B b, C c, D d, E e) {
        super(a, b, c, d);
        fifth = e;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "(" + first + ", " + second + ", " +
        third + ", " + fourth + ", " + fifth + ")";
    }
} ///:~
```
To use a tuple, you simply define the appropriate-length tuple as the return value for your
function, and then create and return it in your return statement:

```java
//: generics/TupleTest.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

class Amphibian {}
class Vehicle {}

public class TupleTest {
    static TwoTuple < String, Integer > f() {
        // Autoboxing converts the int to Integer:
        return new TwoTuple < String, Integer > ("hi", 47);
    }
    static ThreeTuple < Amphibian, String, Integer > g() {
        return new ThreeTuple < Amphibian, String, Integer > (
            new Amphibian(), "hi", 47);
    }
    static
    FourTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > h() {
        return
        new FourTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > (
            new Vehicle(), new Amphibian(), "hi", 47);
    }
    static
    FiveTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer, Double > k() {
        return new
        FiveTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer, Double > (
            new Vehicle(), new Amphibian(), "hi", 47, 11.1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoTuple < String, Integer > ttsi = f();
        System.out.println(ttsi);
        // ttsi.first = "there"; // Compile error: final
        System.out.println(g());
        System.out.println(h());
        System.out.println(k());
    }
} /* Output: (80% match)
(hi, 47)
(Amphibian@1f6a7b9, hi, 47)
(Vehicle@35ce36, Amphibian@757aef, hi, 47)
(Vehicle@9cab16, Amphibian@1a46e30, hi, 47, 11.1)
*///:~
```
Because of generics, you can easily create any tuple to return any group of types, just by
writing the expression.

You can see how the final specification on the public fields prevents them from being
reassigned after construction, in the failure of the statement `ttsi.first = "there"`.

The new expressions are a little verbose. Later in this chapter you'll see how to simplify them
using generic methods.

Exercise 3 : (1) Create and test a SixTuple generic.

Exercise 4: (3) "Generify" innerclasses/Sequence.java.

### ‚òò17.2.2. A stack class
Let's look at something slightly more complicated: the traditional pushdown stack. In the
Holding Your Objects chapter, you saw this implemented using a LinkedList as the
net.mindview.util.Stack class (page 412). In that example, you can see that a LinkedList
already has the necessary methods to create a stack. The Stack was constructed by
composing one generic class (Stack<T>) with another generic class (LinkedList<T>). In
that example, notice that (with a few exceptions that we shall look at later) a generic type is
just another type.

Instead of using LinkedList, we can implement our own internal linked storage mechanism.

```java
//: generics/LinkedStack.java
// A stack implemented with an internal linked structure.

public class LinkedStack < T > {
    private static class Node < U > {
        U item;
        Node < U > next;
        Node() { item = null;
            next = null; }
        Node(U item, Node < U > next) {
            this.item = item;
            this.next = next;
        }
        boolean end() { return item == null && next == null; }
    }
    private Node < T > top = new Node < T > (); // End sentinel
    public void push(T item) {
        top = new Node < T > (item, top);

    }
    public T pop() {
        T result = top.item;
        if (!top.end())
            top = top.next;
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedStack < String > lss = new LinkedStack < String > ();
        for (String s: "Phasers on stun!".split(" "))
            lss.push(s);
        String s;
        while ((s = lss.pop()) != null)
            System.out.println(s);
    }
} /* Output:
stun!
on
Phasers
*///:~
```
The inner class Node is also a generic, and has its own type parameter.
This example makes use of an end sentinel to determine when the stack is empty. The end
sentinel is created when the LinkedStack is constructed, and each time you call push( ) a
new Node<T> is created and linked to the previous Node<T>. When you call pop( ), you
always return the top.item, and then you discard the current Node<T> and move to the
next one‚Äî except when you hit the end sentinel, in which case you don't move. That way, if
the client keeps calling pop( ), they keep getting null back to indicate that the stack is
empty.

Exercise 5: (2) Remove the type parameter on the Node class and modify the rest of the
code in LinkedStack.java to show that an inner class has access to the generic type
parameters of its outer class.

### ‚òò RandomList
For another example of a holder, suppose you'd like a special type of list that randomly
selects one of its elements each time you call select( ). When doing this you want to build a
tool that works with all objects, so you use generics:

```java
//: generics/RandomList.java
import java.util.*;

public class RandomList < T > {
    private ArrayList < T > storage = new ArrayList < T > ();
    private Random rand = new Random(47);
    public void add(T item) { storage.add(item); }
    public T select() {
        return storage.get(rand.nextInt(storage.size()));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RandomList < String > rs = new RandomList < String > ();
        for (String s: ("The quick brown fox jumped over " +
                "the lazy brown dog").split(" "))
            rs.add(s);
        for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++)
            System.out.print(rs.select() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
brown over fox quick quick dog brown The brown lazy brown
*///:~
```

Exercise 6: (1) Use RandomList with two more types in addition to the one shown in
main( ).

## üçÄ17.3. Generic interfaces
Generics also work with interfaces. For example, a generator is a class that creates objects.
It's actually a specialization of the Factory Method design pattern, but when you ask a
generator for new object, you don't pass it any arguments, whereas you typically do pass
arguments to a Factory Method. The generator knows how to create new objects without any
extra information.

Typically, a generator just defines one method, the method that produces new objects. Here,
we'll call it next( ), and include it in the standard utilities:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Generator.java
// A generic interface.
package net.mindview.util;
public interface Generator<T> { T next(); } ///:~
```
The return type of next( ) is parameterized to T. As you can see, using generics with
interfaces is no different than using generics with classes.

To demonstrate the implementation of a Generator, we'll need some classes. Here's a coffee
hierarchy:

```java
//: generics/coffee/Coffee.java
package generics.coffee;

public class Coffee {
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName() + " " + id;
    }
} ///:~


//: generics/coffee/Latte.java
package generics.coffee;
public class Latte extends Coffee {} ///:~


//: generics/coffee/Mocha.java
package generics.coffee;
public class Mocha extends Coffee {} ///:~


//: generics/coffee/Cappuccino.java
package generics.coffee;
public class Cappuccino extends Coffee {} ///:~


//: generics/coffee/Americano.java
package generics.coffee;
public class Americano extends Coffee {} ///:~


//: generics/coffee/Breve.java
package generics.coffee;
public class Breve extends Coffee {} ///:~
```

Now we can implement a Generator < Coffee > that produces random different types of
Coffee objects:

```java
//: generics/coffee/CoffeeGenerator.java
// Generate different types of Coffee:
package generics.coffee;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class CoffeeGenerator
implements Generator < Coffee > , Iterable < Coffee > {
    private Class[] types = {
        Latte.class,
        Mocha.class,
        Cappuccino.class,
        Americano.class,
        Breve.class,
    };
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    public CoffeeGenerator() {}
    // For iteration:
    private int size = 0;
    public CoffeeGenerator(int sz) { size = sz; }
    public Coffee next() {
        try {
            return (Coffee)
            types[rand.nextInt(types.length)].newInstance();
            // Report programmer errors at run time:
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
    class CoffeeIterator implements Iterator < Coffee > {
        int count = size;
        public boolean hasNext() { return count > 0; }
        public Coffee next() {
            count--;
            return CoffeeGenerator.this.next();
        }
        public void remove() { // Not implemented
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        }
    };
    public Iterator < Coffee > iterator() {
        return new CoffeeIterator();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CoffeeGenerator gen = new CoffeeGenerator();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            System.out.println(gen.next());
        for (Coffee c: new CoffeeGenerator(5))
            System.out.println(c);
    }
} /* Output:
Americano 0
Latte 1
Americano 2
Mocha 3
Mocha 4
Breve 5
Americano 6
Latte 7
Cappuccino 8
Cappuccino 9
*///:~
```

The parameterized Generator interface ensures that next( ) returns the parameter type.
CoffeeGenerator also implements the Iterable interface, so it can be used in a foreach
statement. However, it requires an "end sentinel" to know when to stop, and this is produced
using the second constructor.

Here's a second implementation of Generator<T>, this time to produce Fibonacci
numbers:

```java
//: generics/Fibonacci.java
// Generate a Fibonacci sequence.
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class Fibonacci implements Generator < Integer > {
    private int count = 0;
    public Integer next() { return fib(count++); }
    private int fib(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return 1;
        return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Fibonacci gen = new Fibonacci();
        for (int i = 0; i < 18; i++)
            System.out.print(gen.next() + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584
*///:~
```
Although we are working with ints both inside and outside the class, the type parameter is
Integer. This brings up one of the limitations of Java generics: You cannot use primitives as
type parameters. However, Java SE5 conveniently added autoboxing and autounboxing to
convert from primitive types to wrapper types and back. You can see the effect here because
ints are seamlessly used and produced by the class.

We can go one step further and make an Iterable Fibonacci generator. One option is to
reimplement the class and add the Iterable interface, but you don't always have control of
the original code, and you don't want to rewrite when you don't have to. Instead, we can
create an adapter to produce the desired interface‚Äîthis design pattern was introduced
earlier in the book.

Adapters can be implemented in multiple ways. For example, you could use inheritance to
generate the adapted class:

```java
//: generics/IterableFibonacci.java
// Adapt the Fibonacci class to make it Iterable.
import java.util.*;

public class IterableFibonacci
extends Fibonacci implements Iterable < Integer > {
    private int n;
    public IterableFibonacci(int count) { n = count; }
    public Iterator < Integer > iterator() {
        return new Iterator < Integer > () {
            public boolean hasNext() { return n > 0; }
            public Integer next() {
                n--;
                return IterableFibonacci.this.next();
            }
            public void remove() { // Not implemented
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i: new IterableFibonacci(18))
            System.out.print(i + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584
*///:~
```
To use IterableFibonacci in a foreach statement, you give the constructor a boundary so
that hasNext( ) can know when to return false.

Exercise 7: (2) Use composition instead of inheritance to adapt Fibonacci to make it
Iterable.

Exercise 8: (2) Following the form of the Coffee example, create a hierarchy of
StoryCharacters from your favorite movie, dividing them into GoodGuys and BadGuys.
Create a generator for StoryCharacters, following the form of CoffeeGenerator.

## üçÄ17.4. Generic methods
So far we've looked at parameterizing entire classes. You can also parameterize methods
within a class. The class itself may or may not be generic‚Äîthis is independent of whether you
have a generic method.

A generic method allows the method to vary independently of the class. As a guideline, you
should use generic methods "whenever you can." That is, if it's possible to make a method
generic rather than the entire class, it's probably going to be clearer to do so. In addition, if a
method is static, it has no access to the generic type parameters of the class, so if it needs to
use genericity it must be a generic method.

To define a generic method, you simply place a generic parameter list before the return value,
like this:

```java
//: generics/GenericMethods.java

public class GenericMethods {
    public <T> void f(T x) {
        System.out.println(x.getClass().getName());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericMethods gm = new GenericMethods();
        gm.f("");
        gm.f(1);
        gm.f(1.0);
        gm.f(1.0F);
        gm.f('c');
        gm.f(gm);
    }
} /* Output:
java.lang.String
java.lang.Integer
java.lang.Double
java.lang.Float
java.lang.Character
GenericMethods

*///:~
```
The class GenericMethods is not parameterized, although both a class and its methods
may be parameterized at the same time. But in this case, only the method f( ) has a type
parameter, indicated by the parameter list before the method's return type.
Notice that with a generic class, you must specify the type parameters when you instantiate
the class. But with a generic method, you don't usually have to specify the parameter types,
because the compiler can figure that out for you. This is called type argument inference. So
calls to f( ) look like normal method calls, and it appears that f( ) has been infinitely
overloaded. It will even take an argument of the type GenericMethods.
For the calls to f( ) that use primitive types, autoboxing comes into play, automatically
wrapping the primitive types in their associated objects. In fact, generic methods and
autoboxing can eliminate some code that previously required hand conversion.

Exercise 9: (1) Modify GenericMethods.java so that f( ) accepts three arguments, all
of which are of a different parameterized type.

Exercise 10: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that one of f( )'s arguments is non-
parameterized.

### ‚òò17.4.1. Leveraging type argument inference
One of the complaints about generics is that it adds even more text to your code. Consider
holding/MapOfList.java from the Holding Your Objects chapter. The creation of the Map
of List looks like this:

    Map<Person, List<? extends Pet>> petPeople =
    new HashMap<Person, List<? extends Pet>>();

(This use of extends and the question marks will be explained later in this chapter.) It
appears that you are repeating yourself, and that the compiler should figure out one of the
generic argument lists from the other. Alas, it cannot, but type argument inference in a
generic method can produce some simplification. For example, we can create a utility
containing various static methods, which produces the most commonly used
implementations of the various containers:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/New.java
// Utilities to simplify generic container creation
// by using type argument inference.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.*;

public class New {
    public static < K, V > Map < K, V > map() {
        return new HashMap < K, V > ();
    }
    public static < T > List < T > list() {
        return new ArrayList < T > ();
    }
    public static < T > LinkedList < T > lList() {
        return new LinkedList < T > ();
    }
    public static < T > Set < T > set() {
        return new HashSet < T > ();
    }
    public static < T > Queue < T > queue() {

        return new LinkedList < T > ();
    }
    // Examples:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map < String, List < String >> sls = New.map();
        List < String > ls = New.list();
        LinkedList < String > lls = New.lList();
        Set < String > ss = New.set();
        Queue < String > qs = New.queue();
    }
} ///:~
```
In main( ) you can see examples of how this is used‚Äîtype argument inference eliminates
the need to repeat the generic parameter list. This can be applied to
holding/MapOfList.java:

```java
//: generics/SimplerPets.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class SimplerPets {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Person, List<? extends Pet>> petPeople = New.map();
        // Rest of the code is the same...
    }
} ///:~
```
Although this is an interesting example of type argument inference, it's difficult to say how
much it actually buys you. The person reading the code is required to parse and understand
this additional library and its implications, so it might be just as productive to leave the
original (admittedly repetitious) definition in place‚Äîironically, for simplicity. However, if the
standard Java library were to add something like the New.java utility above, it would make
sense to use it.

Type inference doesn't work for anything other than assignment. If you pass the result of a
method call such as New.map( ) as an argument to another method, the compiler will not
try to perform type inference. Instead it will treat the method call as though the return value
is assigned to a variable of type Object. Here's an example that fails:

```java
//: generics/LimitsOfInference.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class LimitsOfInference {
    static void
    f(Map<Person, List<? extends Pet>> petPeople) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // f(New.map()); // Does not compile
    }
} ///:~
```

Exercise 11: (1) Test New.java by creating your own classes and ensuring that New will
work properly with them.

### ‚òò17.4.2. Explicit type specification
It is possible to explicitly specify the type in a generic method, although the syntax is rarely
needed. To do so, you place the type in angle brackets after the dot and immediately
preceding the method name. When calling a method from within the same class, you must
use this before the dot, and when working with static methods, you must use the class name
before the dot. The problem shown in LimitsOflnference.java can be solved using this
syntax:

```java
//: generics/ExplicitTypeSpecification.java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class ExplicitTypeSpecification {
    static void f(Map<Person, List<Pet>> petPeople) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f(New.<Person, List<Pet>>map());
    }
} ///:~
```
Of course, this eliminates the benefit of using the New class to reduce the amount of typing,
but the extra syntax is only required when you are not writing an assignment statement.

Exercise 12: (1) Repeat the previous exercise using explicit type specification.

### ‚òò17.4.3. Varargs and generic methods
Generic methods and variable argument lists coexist nicely:

```java
//: generics/GenericVarargs.java
import java.util.*;

public class GenericVarargs {
    public static < T > List < T > makeList(T...args) {
        List < T > result = new ArrayList < T > ();
        for (T item: args)
            result.add(item);
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < String > ls = makeList("A");
        System.out.println(ls);
        ls = makeList("A", "B", "C");
        System.out.println(ls);
        ls = makeList("ABCDEFFHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split(""));
        System.out.println(ls);
    }
} /* Output:
[A]
[A, B, C]
[, A, B, C, D, E, F, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W,
X, Y, Z]
*///:~
```
The makeList( ) method shown here produces the same functionality as the standard
library's java.util.Arrays.asList( ) method.

### ‚òò17.4.4. A generic method to use with Generators

It is convenient to use a generator to fill a Collection, and it makes sense to "generify" this
operation:

```java
//: generics/Generators.java
// A utility to use with Generators.
import generics.coffee.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class Generators {
    public static < T > Collection < T >
        fill(Collection < T > coll, Generator < T > gen, int n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                coll.add(gen.next());
            return coll;
        }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Collection < Coffee > coffee = fill(
            new ArrayList < Coffee > (), new CoffeeGenerator(), 4);
        for (Coffee c: coffee)
            System.out.println(c);
        Collection < Integer > fnumbers = fill(
            new ArrayList < Integer > (), new Fibonacci(), 12);
        for (int i: fnumbers)
            System.out.print(i + ", ");
    }
} /* Output:
Americano 0
Latte 1
Americano 2
Mocha 3
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,
*///:~
```
Notice how the generic method fill( ) can be transparently applied to both Coffee and
Integer containers and generators.

Exercise 13: (4) Overload the fill( ) method so that the arguments and return types are
the specific subtypes of Collection: List, Queue and Set. This way, you don't lose the type
of container. Can you overload to distinguish between List and LinkedList?

### ‚òò17.4.5. A general-purpose Generator
Here's a class that produces a Generator for any class that has a default constructor. To
reduce typing, it also includes a generic method to produce a BasicGenerator:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/BasicGenerator.java
// Automatically create a Generator, given a class
// with a default (no-arg) constructor.
package net.mindview.util;

public class BasicGenerator < T > implements Generator < T > {
    private Class < T > type;
    public BasicGenerator(Class < T > type) { this.type = type; }
    public T next() {
        try {
            // Assumes type is a public class:
            return type.newInstance();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
    // Produce a Default generator given a type token:
    public static < T > Generator < T > create(Class < T > type) {
        return new BasicGenerator < T > (type);
    }
} ///:~
```
This class provides a basic implementation that will produce objects of a class that (1) is
public (because BasicGenerator is in a separate package, the class in question must have
public and not just package access) and (2) has a default constructor (one that takes no
arguments). To create one of these BasicGenerator objects, you call the create( ) method
and pass it the type token for the type you want generated. The generic create( ) method
allows you to say BasicGenerator.create(MyType.class) instead of the more awkward
new BasicGenerator<MyType>(MyType.class).

For example, here's a simple class that has a default constructor:

```java
//: generics/CountedObject.java

public class CountedObject {
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public long id() { return id; }
    public String toString() { return "CountedObject " + id;}
} ///:~
```
The CountedObject class keeps track of how many instances of itself have been created,
and reports these in its toString( ).

Using BasicGenerator, you can easily create a Generator for CountedObject:

```java
//: generics/BasicGeneratorDemo.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class BasicGeneratorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Generator<CountedObject> gen =
            BasicGenerator.create(CountedObject.class);
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            System.out.println(gen.next());
    }
} /* Output:
CountedObject 0
CountedObject 1
CountedObject 2
CountedObject 3
CountedObject 4
*///:~
```
You can see how the generic method reduces the amount of typing necessary to produce the
Generator object. Java generics force you to pass in the Class object anyway, so you might
as well use it for type inference in the create( ) method.

Exercise 14: (1) Modify BasicGeneratorDemo.java to use the explicit form of
creation for the Generator (that is, use the explicit constructor instead of the generic
create( ) method).

### ‚òò17.4.6. Simplifying tuple use
Type argument inference, together with static imports, allows the tuples we saw earlier to be
rewritten into a more general-purpose library. Here, tuples can be created using an
overloaded static method:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Tuple.java
// Tuple library using type argument inference.
package net.mindview.util;

public class Tuple {
    public static < A, B > TwoTuple < A, B > tuple(A a, B b) {
        return new TwoTuple < A, B > (a, b);
    }
    public static < A, B, C > ThreeTuple < A, B, C >
    tuple(A a, B b, C c) {
        return new ThreeTuple < A, B, C > (a, b, c);
    }
    public static < A, B, C, D > FourTuple < A, B, C, D >
    tuple(A a, B b, C c, D d) {
        return new FourTuple < A, B, C, D > (a, b, c, d);
    }
    public static < A, B, C, D, E >
    FiveTuple < A, B, C, D, E > tuple(A a, B b, C c, D d, E e) {
        return new FiveTuple < A, B, C, D, E > (a, b, c, d, e);
    }
} ///:~
```
Here's a modification of TupleTest.java to test Tuple.java:

```java
//: generics/TupleTest2.java
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Tuple.*;

public class TupleTest2 {
    static TwoTuple < String, Integer > f() {
        return tuple("hi", 47);
    }
    static TwoTuple f2() { return tuple("hi", 47); }
    static ThreeTuple < Amphibian, String, Integer > g() {
        return tuple(new Amphibian(), "hi", 47);
    }
    static
    FourTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > h() {
        return tuple(new Vehicle(), new Amphibian(), "hi", 47);
    }
    static
    FiveTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer, Double > k() {
        return tuple(new Vehicle(), new Amphibian(),
            "hi", 47, 11.1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoTuple < String, Integer > ttsi = f();
        System.out.println(ttsi);
        System.out.println(f2());
        System.out.println(g());

        System.out.println(h());
        System.out.println(k());
    }
} /* Output: (80% match)
(hi, 47)
(hi, 47)
(Amphibian@7d772e, hi, 47)
(Vehicle@757aef, Amphibian@d9f9c3, hi, 47)
(Vehicle@1a46e30, Amphibian@3e25a5, hi, 47, 11.1)
*///:~
```
Notice that f( ) returns a parameterized TwoTuple object, while f2( ) returns an
unparameterized TwoTuple object. The compiler doesn't warn about f2( ) in this case
because the return value is not being used in a parameterized fashion; in a sense, it is being
"upcast" to an unparameterized TwoTuple. However, if you were to try to capture the result
of f2( ) into a parameterized TwoTuple, the compiler would issue a warning.

Exercise 15: (1) Verify the previous statement.

Exercise 16: (2) Add a SixTuple to Tuple.java, and test it in TupleTest2 .j ava.

### ‚òò17.4.7. A Set utility
For another example of the use of generic methods, consider the mathematical relationships
that can be expressed using Sets. These can be conveniently defined as generic methods, to
be used with all different types:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Sets.java
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.*;

public class Sets {
    public static < T > Set < T > union(Set < T > a, Set < T > b) {
        Set < T > result = new HashSet < T > (a);
        result.addAll(b);
        return result;
    }
    public static < T >
        Set < T > intersection(Set < T > a, Set < T > b) {
            Set < T > result = new HashSet < T > (a);
            result.retainAll(b);
            return result;
        }
    // Subtract subset from superset:
    public static < T > Set < T >
        difference(Set < T > superset, Set < T > subset) {
            Set < T > result = new HashSet < T > (superset);
            result.removeAll(subset);
            return result;
        }
    // Reflexive--everything not in the intersection:
    public static < T > Set < T > complement(Set < T > a, Set < T > b) {
        return difference(union(a, b), intersection(a, b));
    }
} ///:~
```
The first three methods duplicate the first argument by copying its references into a new
HashSet object, so the argument Sets are not directly modified. The return value is thus a
new Set object.

The four methods represent mathematical set operations: union( ) returns a Set containing
the combination of the two arguments, intersection( ) returns a Set containing the
common elements between the two arguments, difference( ) performs a subtraction of the
subset elements from the superset, and complement( ) returns a Set of all the elements
that are not in the intersection. To create a simple example showing the effects of these
methods, here's an enum containing different names of watercolors:

```java
//: generics/watercolors/Watercolors.java
package generics.watercolors;

public enum Watercolors {
    ZINC, LEMON_YELLOW, MEDIUM_YELLOW, DEEP_YELLOW, ORANGE,
    BRILLIANT_RED, CRIMSON, MAGENTA, ROSE_MADDER, VIOLET,
    CERULEAN_BLUE_HUE, PHTHALO_BLUE, ULTRAMARINE,
    COBALT_BLUE_HUE, PERMANENT_GREEN, VIRIDIAN_HUE,
    SAP_GREEN, YELLOW_OCHRE, BURNT_SIENNA, RAW_UMBER,
    BURNT_UMBER, PAYNES_GRAY, IVORY_BLACK
} ///:~
```
For convenience (so that all the names don't have to be qualified), this is imported statically
into the following example. This example uses the EnumSet, which is a Java SE5 tool for
easy creation of Sets from enums. (You'll learn more about EnumSet in the Enumerated
Types chapter.) Here, the static method EnumSet.range( ) is given the first and last
elements of the range to create in the resulting Set:

```java
//: generics/WatercolorSets.java
import generics.watercolors.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Sets.*;
import static generics.watercolors.Watercolors.*;

public class WatercolorSets {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set < Watercolors > set1 =
            EnumSet.range(BRILLIANT_RED, VIRIDIAN_HUE);
        Set < Watercolors > set2 =
            EnumSet.range(CERULEAN_BLUE_HUE, BURNT_UMBER);
        print("set1: " + set1);
        print("set2: " + set2);
        print("union(set1, set2): " + union(set1, set2));
        Set < Watercolors > subset = intersection(set1, set2);
        print("intersection(set1, set2): " + subset);
        print("difference(set1, subset): " +
            difference(set1, subset));
        print("difference(set2, subset): " +
            difference(set2, subset));
        print("complement(set1, set2): " +
            complement(set1, set2));
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
set1: [BRILLIANT_RED, CRIMSON, MAGENTA, ROSE_MADDER, VIOLET,
CERULEAN_BLUE_HUE, PHTHALO_BLUE, ULTRAMARINE, COBALT_BLUE_HUE,
PERMANENT_GREEN, VIRIDIAN_HUE]
set2: [CERULEAN_BLUE_HUE, PHTHALO_BLUE, ULTRAMARINE, COBALT_BLUE_HUE,

```
You can see the results of each operation from the output. The following example uses
Sets.difference( ) to show the method differences between various Collection and Map
classes in java.util:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/ContainerMethodDifferences.java
package net.mindview.util;
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ContainerMethodDifferences {
    static Set < String > methodSet(Class < ? > type) {
        Set < String > result = new TreeSet < String > ();
        for (Method m: type.getMethods())
            result.add(m.getName());
        return result;
    }
    static void interfaces(Class < ? > type) {
        System.out.print("Interfaces in " +
            type.getSimpleName() + ": ");
        List < String > result = new ArrayList < String > ();
        for (Class < ? > c : type.getInterfaces())
            result.add(c.getSimpleName());
        System.out.println(result);
    }
    static Set < String > object = methodSet(Object.class);
    static { object.add("clone"); }
    static void
    difference(Class < ? > superset, Class < ? > subset) {
        System.out.print(superset.getSimpleName() +
            " extends " + subset.getSimpleName() + ", adds: ");
        Set < String > comp = Sets.difference(
            methodSet(superset), methodSet(subset));
        comp.removeAll(object); // Don't show 'Object' methods
        System.out.println(comp);
        interfaces(superset);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Collection: " +
            methodSet(Collection.class));
        interfaces(Collection.class);
        difference(Set.class, Collection.class);
        difference(HashSet.class, Set.class);
        difference(LinkedHashSet.class, HashSet.class);
        difference(TreeSet.class, Set.class);
        difference(List.class, Collection.class);
        difference(ArrayList.class, List.class);
        difference(LinkedList.class, List.class);
        difference(Queue.class, Collection.class);
        difference(PriorityQueue.class, Queue.class);
        System.out.println("Map: " + methodSet(Map.class));
        difference(HashMap.class, Map.class);
        difference(LinkedHashMap.class, HashMap.class);
        difference(SortedMap.class, Map.class);
        difference(TreeMap.class, Map.class);
    }

The output of this program was used in the "Summary" section of the Holding Your Objects
chapter.

Exercise 17: (4) Study the JDK documentation for EnumSet. You'll see that there's a
clone( ) method defined. However, you cannot clone( ) from the reference to the Set
interface passed in Sets.java. Can you modify Sets.java to handle both the general case of a
Set interface as shown, and the special case of an EnumSet, using clone( ) instead of
creating a new HashSet?

## üçÄ17.5. Anonymous inner classes
Generics can also be used with inner classes and anonymous inner classes. Here's an example
that implements the Generator interface using anonymous inner classes:

```java
//: generics/BankTeller.java
// A very simple bank teller simulation.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

class Customer {
    private static long counter = 1;
    private final long id = counter++;
    private Customer() {}
    public String toString() { return "Customer " + id; }
    // A method to produce Generator objects:
    public static Generator < Customer > generator() {
        return new Generator < Customer > () {
            public Customer next() { return new Customer(); }
        };
    }
}

class Teller {
    private static long counter = 1;
    private final long id = counter++;
    private Teller() {}
    public String toString() { return "Teller " + id; }
    // A single Generator object:
    public static Generator < Teller > generator =
        new Generator < Teller > () {
            public Teller next() { return new Teller(); }
        };
}

public class BankTeller {
    public static void serve(Teller t, Customer c) {
        System.out.println(t + " serves " + c);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        Queue < Customer > line = new LinkedList < Customer > ();
        Generators.fill(line, Customer.generator(), 15);
        List < Teller > tellers = new ArrayList < Teller > ();
        Generators.fill(tellers, Teller.generator, 4);
        for (Customer c: line)
            serve(tellers.get(rand.nextInt(tellers.size())), c);
    }
} /* Output:
Teller 3 serves Customer 1
Teller 2 serves Customer 2
Teller 3 serves Customer 3
Teller 1 serves Customer 4
Teller 1 serves Customer 5
Teller 3 serves Customer 6
Teller 1 serves Customer 7
Teller 2 serves Customer 8
Teller 3 serves Customer 9
Teller 3 serves Customer 10
Teller 2 serves Customer 11
Teller 4 serves Customer 12
Teller 2 serves Customer 13
Teller 1 serves Customer 14
Teller 1 serves Customer 15
*///:~
```
Both Customer and Teller have private constructors, thereby forcing you to use
Generator objects. Customer has a generator( ) method that produces a new
Generator<Customer> object each time you call it. You may not need multiple
Generator objects, and Teller creates a single public generator object. You can see both
of these approaches used in the fill( ) methods in main( ).

Since both the generator( ) method in Customer and the Generator object in Teller are
static, they cannot be part of an interface, so there is no way to "generify" this particular
idiom. Despite that, it works reasonably well with the fill( ) method.
We'll look at other versions of this queuing problem in the Concurrency chapter.

Exercise 18: (3) Following the form of BankTeller.java, create an example where
BigFish eat LittleFish in the Ocean.

## üçÄ17.6. Building complex models
An important benefit of generics is the ability to simply and safely create complex models.
For example, we can easily create a List of tuples:

```java
//: generics/TupleList.java
// Combining generic types to make complex generic types.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class TupleList < A, B, C, D >
    extends ArrayList < FourTuple < A, B, C, D >> {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            TupleList < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > tl =
                new TupleList < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > ();
            tl.add(TupleTest.h());
            tl.add(TupleTest.h());
            for (FourTuple < Vehicle, Amphibian, String, Integer > i: tl)
                System.out.println(i);
        }
    } /* Output: (75% match)
(Vehicle@11b86e7, Amphibian@35ce36, hi, 47)
(Vehicle@757aef, Amphibian@d9f9c3, hi, 47)

*///:~
```
Although it gets somewhat verbose (especially the creation of the iterator), you end up with a
fairly powerful data structure without too much code.

Here's another example showing how straightforward it is to build complex models using
generic types. Even though each class is created as a building block, the total has many parts.
In this case, the model is a retail store with aisles, shelves and products:

```java
//: generics/Store.java
// Building up a complex model using generic containers.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

class Product {
    private final int id;
    private String description;
    private double price;
    public Product(int IDnumber, String descr, double price) {
        id = IDnumber;
        description = descr;
        this.price = price;
        System.out.println(toString());
    }
    public String toString() {
        return id + ": " + description + ", price: $" + price;
    }
    public void priceChange(double change) {
        price += change;
    }
    public static Generator < Product > generator =
        new Generator < Product > () {
            private Random rand = new Random(47);
            public Product next() {
                return new Product(rand.nextInt(1000), "Test",
                    Math.round(rand.nextDouble() * 1000.0) + 0.99);
            }
        };
}

class Shelf extends ArrayList < Product > {
    public Shelf(int nProducts) {
        Generators.fill(this, Product.generator, nProducts);
    }
}

class Aisle extends ArrayList < Shelf > {
    public Aisle(int nShelves, int nProducts) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nShelves; i++)
            add(new Shelf(nProducts));
    }
}

class CheckoutStand {}
class Office {}

public class Store extends ArrayList < Aisle > {
    private ArrayList < CheckoutStand > checkouts =
    new ArrayList < CheckoutStand > ();
    private Office office = new Office();
    public Store(int nAisles, int nShelves, int nProducts) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nAisles; i++)
            add(new Aisle(nShelves, nProducts));
    }
    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (Aisle a: this)
            for (Shelf s: a)
                for (Product p: s) {
                    result.append(p);
                    result.append("\n");
                }
        return result.toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new Store(14, 5, 10));
    }
} /* Output:
258: Test, price: $400.99
861: Test, price: $160.99
868: Test, price: $417.99
207: Test, price: $268.99
551: Test, price: $114.99
278: Test, price: $804.99
520: Test, price: $554.99
140: Test, price: $530.99

*///:~
```
As you can see in Store.toString( ), the result is many layers of containers that are
nonetheless type-safe and manageable. What's impressive is that it is not intellectually
prohibitive to assemble such a model.

Exercise 19: (2) Following the form of Store.java, build a model of a containerized
cargo ship.

## üçÄ17.7. The mystery of erasure
As you begin to delve more deeply into generics, there are a number of things that won't
initially make sense. For example, although you can say ArrayList.class, you cannot say
ArrayList<Integer>.class. And consider the following:

```java
//: generics/ErasedTypeEquivalence.java
import java.util.*;

public class ErasedTypeEquivalence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class c1 = new ArrayList<String>().getClass();
        Class c2 = new ArrayList<Integer>().getClass();
        System.out.println(c1 == c2);
    }
} /* Output:
true
*///:~
```
Array List < String > and Array List < Integer > could easily be argued to be distinct
types. Different types behave differently, and if you try, for example, to put an Integer into
an Array List < String >, you get different behavior (it fails) than if you put an Integer
into an ArrayList< Integer > (it succeeds). And yet the above program suggests that they
are the same type.

Here's an example that adds to this puzzle:

```java
//: generics/LostInformation.java
import java.util.*;

class Frob {}
class Fnorkle {}
class Quark<Q> {}
class Particle<POSITION,MOMENTUM> {}

public class LostInformation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Frob > list = new ArrayList < Frob > ();
        Map < Frob, Fnorkle > map = new HashMap < Frob, Fnorkle > ();
        Quark < Fnorkle > quark = new Quark < Fnorkle > ();
        Particle < Long, Double > p = new Particle < Long, Double > ();
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(
            list.getClass().getTypeParameters()));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(
            map.getClass().getTypeParameters()));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(
            quark.getClass().getTypeParameters()));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(
            p.getClass().getTypeParameters()));
    }
} /* Output:

[POSITION, MOMENTUM]
*///:~
```
According to the JDK documentation, Class.getTypeParameters( ) "returns an array of
TypeVariable objects that represent the type variables declared by the generic
declaration..." This seems to suggest that you might be able to find out what the parameter
types are. However, as you can see from the output, all you find out is the identifiers that are
used as the parameter placeholders, which is not such an interesting piece of information.

The cold truth is:
There's no information about generic parameter types available inside generic code.

Thus, you can know things like the identifier of the type parameter and the bounds of the
generic type‚Äîyou just can't know the actual type parameter(s) used to create a particular
instance. This fact, which is especially frustrating if you're coming from C++, is the most
fundamental issue that you must deal with when working with Java generics.

Java generics are implemented using erasure. This means that any specific type information
is erased when you use a generic. Inside the generic, the only thing that you know is that
you're using an object. So List<String> and List< Integer> are, in fact, the same type at
run time. Both forms are "erased" to their raw type, List. Understanding erasure and how
you must deal with it will be one of the biggest hurdles you will face when learning Java
generics, and that's what we'll explore in this section.

### ‚òò17.7.1. The C++ approach
Here's a C++ example which uses templates. You'll notice that the syntax for parameterized
types is quite similar, because Java took inspiration from C++:

```cpp
//: generics/Templates.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template<class T> class Manipulator {
    T obj;
public:
    Manipulator(T x) { obj = x; }
    void manipulate() { obj.f(); }
};

class HasF {
public:
    void f() { cout << "HasF::f()" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    HasF hf;
    Manipulator<HasF> manipulator(hf);
    manipulator.manipulate();
} /* Output:
HasF::f()
///:~
```
The Manipulator class stores an object of type T. What's interesting is the manipulate( )
method, which calls a method f( ) on obj. How can it know that the f( ) method exists for the
type parameter T? The C++ compiler checks when you instantiate the template, so at the
point of instantiation of Manipulator <HasF>, it sees that HasF has a method f( ). If it
were not the case, you'd get a compile-time error, and thus type safety is preserved.

Writing this kind of code in C++ is straightforward because when a template is instantiated,
the template code knows the type of its template parameters. Java generics are different.
Here's the translation of HasF:

```java
//: generics/HasF.java

public class HasF {
    public void f() { System.out.println("HasF.f()"); }
} ///:~
```
If we take the rest of the example and translate it to Java, it won't compile:

```java
//: generics/Manipulation.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

class Manipulator<T> {
    private T obj;
    public Manipulator(T x) { obj = x; }
    // Error: cannot find symbol: method f():
    public void manipulate() { obj.f(); }
}

public class Manipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    HasF hf = new HasF();

    Manipulator<HasF> manipulator =
        new Manipulator<HasF>(hf);
        manipulator.manipulate();
    }
} ///:~
```
Because of erasure, the Java compiler can't map the requirement that manipulate( ) must
be able to call f( ) on obj to the fact that HasF has a method f( ). In order to call f( ), we
must assist the generic class by giving it a bound that tells the compiler to only accept types
that conform to that bound. This reuses the extends keyword. Because of the bound, the
following compiles:

```java
//: generics/Manipulator2.java

class Manipulator2<T extends HasF> {
    private T obj;
    public Manipulator2(T x) { obj = x; }
    public void manipulate() { obj.f(); }
} ///:~
```
The bound <T extends HasF> says that T must be of type HasF or something derived
from HasF. If this is true, then it is safe to call f( ) on obj.

We say that a generic type parameter erases to its first bound (it's possible to have multiple
bounds, as you shall see later). We also talk about the erasure of the type parameter. The
compiler actually replaces the type parameter with its erasure, so in the above case, T erases
to HasF, which is the same as replacing T with HasF in the class body.

You may correctly observe that in Manipulations.Java, generics do not contribute
anything. You could just as easily perform the erasure yourself and produce a class without
generics:

```java
//: generics/Manipulator3.java

class Manipulator3 {
    private HasF obj;
    public Manipulator3(HasF x) { obj = x; }
    public void manipulate() { obj.f(); }
} ///:~
```
This brings up an important point: Generics are only useful when you want to use type
parameters that are more "generic" than a specific type (and all its subtypes)‚Äîthat is, when
you want code to work across multiple classes. As a result, the type parameters and their
application in useful generic code will usually be more complex than simple class
replacement. However, you can't just say that anything of the form <T extends HasF> is
therefore flawed. For example, if a class has a method that returns T, then generics are
helpful, because they will then return the exact type:

```java
//: generics/ReturnGenericType.java

class ReturnGenericType<T extends HasF> {
    private T obj;
    public ReturnGenericType(T x) { obj = x; }
    public T get() { return obj; }
} ///:~
```
You have to look at all the code and understand whether it is "complex enough" to warrant
the use of generics.

We'll look at bounds in more detail later in the chapter.

Exercise 20: (1) Create an interface with two methods, and a class that implements that
interface and adds another method. In another class, create a generic method with an
argument type that is bounded by the interface, and show that the methods in the interface
are callable inside this generic method. In main( ), pass an instance of the implementing
class to the generic method.

### ‚òò17.7.2. Migration compatibility
To allay any potential confusion about erasure, you must clearly understand that it is not a
language feature. It is a compromise in the implementation of Java generics, necessary
because generics were not made part of the language from the beginning. This compromise
will cause you pain, so you need to get used to it early and to understand why it's there.

If generics had been part of Java l.o, the feature would not have been implemented using
erasure‚Äîit would have used reification to retain the type parameters as first-class entities, so
you would have been able to perform type-based language and reflective operations on type
parameters. You'll see later in this chapter that erasure reduces the "genericity" of generics.
Generics are still useful in Java, just not as useful as they could be, and the reason is erasure.

In an erasure-based implementation, generic types are treated as secondclass types that
cannot be used in some important contexts. The generic types are present only during static
type checking, after which every generic type in the program is erased by replacing it with a
non-generic upper bound. For example, type annotations such as List<T> are erased to
List, and ordinary type variables are erased to Object unless a bound is specified.

The core motivation for erasure is that it allows generified clients to be used with non-
generified libraries, and vice versa. This is often called migration compatibility. In the ideal
world, we would have had a single day when everything was generified at once. In reality,
even if programmers are only writing generic code, they will have to deal with non-generic
libraries that were written before Java SE5. The authors of those libraries may never have the
incentive to generify their code, or they may just take their time in getting to it.

So Java generics not only must support backwards compatibility‚Äîexisting code and class
files are still legal, and continue to mean what they meant before‚Äîbut also must support
migration compatibility, so that libraries can become generic at their own pace, and when a
library does become generic, it doesn't break code and applications that depend upon it. After
deciding that this was the goal, the Java designers and the various groups working on the
problem decided that erasure was the only feasible solution. Erasure enables this migration
towards generics by allowing non-generic code to coexist with generic code.

For example, suppose an application uses two libraries, X and Y, and Y uses library Z. With
the advent of Java SE5, the creators of this application and these libraries will probably,
eventually, want to migrate to generics. Each of them, however, will have different
motivations and constraints as to when that migration happens. To achieve migration
compatibility, each library and application must be independent of all the others regarding
whether generics are used. Thus, they must not be able to detect whether other libraries are
or are not using generics. Ergo, the evidence that a particular library is using generics must
be "erased."

Without some kind of migration path, all the libraries that had been built up over time stood
the chance of being cut off from the developers that chose to move to Java generics. Libraries
are arguably the part of a programming language that has the greatest productivity impact,
so this was not an acceptable cost. Whether or not erasure was the best or only migration
path is something that only time will tell.

### ‚òò17.7.3. The problem with erasure
So the primary justification for erasure is the transition process from nongenerified code to
generified code, and to incorporate generics into the language without breaking existing
libraries. Erasure allows existing nongeneric client code to continue to be used without
change, until clients are ready to rewrite code for generics. This is a noble motivation,
because it doesn't suddenly break all existing code.

The cost of erasure is significant. Generic types cannot be used in operations that explicitly
refer to runtime types, such as casts, instanceof operations, and new expressions. Because
all the type information about the parameters is lost, whenever you're writing generic code
you must constantly be reminding yourself that it only appears that you have type
information about a parameter. So when you write a piece of code like this:

    class Foo<T> {
    T var;
    }

it appears that when you create an instance of Foo:

    Foo<Cat> f = new Foo<Cat>();

the code in class Foo ought to know that it is now working with a Cat. The syntax strongly
suggests that the type T is being substituted everywhere throughout the class. But it isn't, and
you must remind yourself, "No, it's just an Object," whenever you're writing the code for the
class.

In addition, erasure and migration compatibility mean that the use of generics is not
enforced when you might want it to be:

```java
//: generics/ErasureAndInheritance.java

class GenericBase < T > {
    private T element;
    public void set(T arg) { arg = element; }
    public T get() { return element; }
}

class Derived1 < T > extends GenericBase < T > {}

class Derived2 extends GenericBase {} // No warning

// class Derived3 extends GenericBase<?> {}
// Strange error:
// unexpected type found : ?
// required: class or interface without bounds

public class ErasureAndInheritance {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Derived2 d2 = new Derived2();
        Object obj = d2.get();
        d2.set(obj); // Warning here!
    }
} ///:~
```
Derived2 inherits from GenericBase with no generic parameters, and the compiler
doesn't issue a warning. The warning doesn't occur until set( ) is called.
To turn off the warning, Java provides an annotation, the one that you see in the listing (this
annotation was not supported in earlier releases of Java SE5):

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")

Notice that this is placed on the method that generates the warning, rather than the entire
class. It's best to be as "focused" as possible when you turn off a warning, so that you don't
accidentally cloak a real problem by turning off warnings too broadly.

Presumably, the error produced by Derived3 means that the compiler expects a raw base class.

Add to this the extra effort of managing bounds when you want to treat your type parameter
as more than just an Object, and you have far more effort for much less payoff than you get
in parameterized types in languages like C++, Ada or Eiffel. This is not to say that those
languages in general buy you more than Java does for the majority of programming
problems, but rather that their parameterized type mechanisms are more flexible and
powerful than Java's.

### ‚òò17.7.4. The action at the boundaries
Because of erasure, I find that the most confusing aspect of generics is the fact that you can
represent things that have no meaning. For example:

```java
//: generics/ArrayMaker.java
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayMaker < T > {
    private Class < T > kind;
    public ArrayMaker(Class < T > kind) { this.kind = kind; }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    T[] create(int size) {
        return (T[]) Array.newInstance(kind, size);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayMaker < String > stringMaker =
            new ArrayMaker < String > (String.class);
        String[] stringArray = stringMaker.create(9);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(stringArray));
    }
} /* Output:
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
*///:~
```
Even though kind is stored as Class<T>, erasure means that it is actually just being stored
as a Class, with no parameter. So, when you do something with it, as in creating an array,
Array.newInstance( ) doesn't actually have the type information that's implied in kind;
so it cannot produce the specific result, which must therefore be cast, which produces a
warning that you cannot satisfy.

Note that using Array.newInstance( ) is the recommended approach for creating arrays in
generics.

If we create a container instead of an array, things are different:

```java
//: generics/ListMaker.java
import java.util.*;


public class ListMaker<T> {
    List<T> create() { return new ArrayList<T>(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ListMaker<String> stringMaker= new ListMaker<String>();
        List<String> stringList = stringMaker.create();
    }
} ///:~
```
The compiler gives no warnings, even though we know (from erasure) that the <T> in new
ArrayList<T>( ) inside create( ) is removed‚Äîat run time there's no <T> inside the class,
so it seems meaningless. But if you follow this idea and change the expression to new
ArrayList( ), the compiler gives a warning.

Is it really meaningless in this case? What if you were to put some objects in the list before
returning it, like this:

```java
//: generics/FilledListMaker.java
import java.util.*;

public class FilledListMaker<T> {
    List<T> create(T t, int n) {
        List<T> result = new ArrayList<T>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            result.add(t);
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FilledListMaker<String> stringMaker =
            new FilledListMaker<String>();
        List<String> list = stringMaker.create("Hello", 4);
        System.out.println(list);
    }
} /* Output:
[Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello]
*///:~
```
Even though the compiler is unable to know anything about T inside create( ), it can still
ensure‚Äîat compile time‚Äîthat what you put into result is of type T, so that it agrees with
ArrayList<T>. Thus, even though erasure removes the information about the actual type
inside a method or class, the compiler can still ensure internal consistency in the way that the
type is used within the method or class.

Because erasure removes type information in the body of a method, what matters at run time
is the boundaries: the points where objects enter and leave a method. These are the points at
which the compiler performs type checks at compile time, and inserts casting code. Consider
the following nongeneric example:

```java
//: generics/SimpleHolder.java

public class SimpleHolder {
    private Object obj;
    public void set(Object obj) { this.obj = obj; }
    public Object get() { return obj; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleHolder holder = new SimpleHolder();
        holder.set("Item");
        String s = (String)holder.get();
    }
} ///:~
```
If we decompile the result with javap -c SimpleHolder, we get (after editing):

```java
public void set(java.lang.Object);
0: aload_0
1: aload_1
2: putfield #2; //Field obj:Object;
5: return

public java.lang.Object get();
0: aload_0
1: getfield #2; //Field obj:Object;
4: areturn

public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
0: new #3; //class SimpleHolder
3: dup
4: invokespecial #4; //Method "<init>":()V
7: astore_1
8: aload_1
9: ldc #5; //String Item
11: invokevirtual #6; //Method set:(Object;)V
14: aload_1
15: invokevirtual #7; //Method get:()Object;
18: checkcast #8; //class java/lang/String
21: astore_2
22: return
```

The set( ) and get( ) methods simply store and produce the value, and the cast is checked at
the point of the call to get( ).

Now incorporate generics into the above code:

```java
//: generics/GenericHolder.java

public class GenericHolder < T > {
    private T obj;
    public void set(T obj) { this.obj = obj; }
    public T get() { return obj; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericHolder < String > holder =
            new GenericHolder < String > ();
        holder.set("Item");
        String s = holder.get();
    }
} ///:~
```
The need for the cast from get( ) has disappeared, but we also know that the value passed to
set( ) is being type-checked at compile time. Here are the relevant bytecodes:

```java
public void set(java.lang.Object);
0: aload_0
1: aload_1
2: putfield #2; //Field obj:Object;
5: return

public java.lang.Object get();
0: aload_0
1: getfield #2; //Field obj:Object;
4: areturn

public static void main(java.lang.String[]);

0: new #3; //class GenericHolder
3: dup
4: invokespecial #4; //Method "<init>":()V
7: astore_1
8: aload_1
9: ldc #5; //String Item
11: invokevirtual #6; //Method set:(Object;)V
14: aload_1
15: invokevirtual #7; //Method get:()Object;
18: checkcast #8; //class java/lang/String
21: astore_2
22: return
```

The resulting code is identical. The extra work of checking the incoming type in set( ) is free,
because it is performed by the compiler. And the cast for the outgoing value of get( ) is still
there, but it's no less than you'd have to do yourself‚Äîand it's automatically inserted by the
compiler, so the code you write (and read) is less noisy.

Since get( ) and set( ) produce the same bytecodes, all the action in generics happens at the
boundaries‚Äîthe extra compile-time check for incoming values, and the inserted cast for
outgoing values. It helps to counter the confusion of erasure to remember that "the
boundaries are where the action takes place."

## üçÄ17.8. Compensating for erasure
As we've seen, erasure loses the ability to perform certain operations in generic code.
Anything that requires the knowledge of the exact type at run time won't work:

```java
//: generics/Erased.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

public class Erased < T > {
    private final int SIZE = 100;
    public static void f(Object arg) {
        if (arg instanceof T) {} // Error
        T
        var = new T(); // Error
        T[] array = new T[SIZE]; // Error
        T[] array = (T) new Object[SIZE]; // Unchecked warning
    }
} ///:~
```
Occasionally you can program around these issues, but sometimes you must compensate for
erasure by introducing a type tag. This means you explicitly pass in the Class object for your
type so that you can use it in type expressions.

For example, the attempt to use instanceof in the previous program fails because the type
information has been erased. If you introduce a type tag, a dynamic islnstance( ) can be
used instead:

```java
//: generics/ClassTypeCapture.java

class Building {}
class House extends Building {}

public class ClassTypeCapture < T > {
    Class < T > kind;
    public ClassTypeCapture(Class < T > kind) {
        this.kind = kind;
    }
    public boolean f(Object arg) {
        return kind.isInstance(arg);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassTypeCapture < Building > ctt1 =
            new ClassTypeCapture < Building > (Building.class);
        System.out.println(ctt1.f(new Building()));
        System.out.println(ctt1.f(new House()));
        ClassTypeCapture < House > ctt2 =
            new ClassTypeCapture < House > (House.class);
        System.out.println(ctt2.f(new Building()));
        System.out.println(ctt2.f(new House()));
    }
} /* Output:
true
true
false
true
*///:~
```
The compiler ensures that the type tag matches the generic argument.

Exercise 21: ( 4) Modify ClassTypeCapture.java by adding a
Map<String,Class<?>>, a method addType(String typename, Class<?> kind), and
a method createNew(String typename). createNew( ) will either produce a new
instance of the class associated with its argument string, or produce an error message.

### ‚òò17.8.1. Creating instances of types
The attempt to create a new T( ) in Erased.java won't work, partly because of erasure, and
partly because the compiler cannot verify that T has a default (no-arg) constructor. But in
C++ this operation is natural, straightforward, and safe (it's checked at compile time):

```java
//: generics/InstantiateGenericType.cpp
// C++, not Java!

template<class T> class Foo {
    T x; // Create a field of type T
    T* y; // Pointer to T
    public:
    // Initialize the pointer:
    Foo() { y = new T(); }
};

class Bar {};

int main() {
    Foo<Bar> fb;
    Foo<int> fi; // ... and it works with primitives
} ///:~
```

The solution in Java is to pass in a factory object, and use that to make the new instance. A
convenient factory object is just the Class object, so if you use a type tag, you can use
newlnstance( ) to create a new object of that type:

```java
//: generics/InstantiateGenericType.java
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class ClassAsFactory < T > {
    T x;
    public ClassAsFactory(Class < T > kind) {
        try {
            x = kind.newInstance();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}

class Employee {}

public class InstantiateGenericType {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassAsFactory < Employee > fe =
            new ClassAsFactory < Employee > (Employee.class);
        print("ClassAsFactory<Employee> succeeded");
        try {
            ClassAsFactory < Integer > fi =
                new ClassAsFactory < Integer > (Integer.class);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            print("ClassAsFactory<Integer> failed");
        }
    }
} /* Output:
ClassAsFactory<Employee> succeeded
ClassAsFactory<Integer> failed
*///:~
```
This compiles, but fails with ClassAsFactory<Integer> because Integer has no default
constructor. Because the error is not caught at compile time, this approach is frowned upon
by the Sun folks. They suggest instead that you use an explicit factory and constrain the type
so that it only takes a class that implements this factory:

```java
//: generics/FactoryConstraint.java

interface FactoryI < T > {
    T create();
}

class Foo2 < T > {
    private T x;
    public < F extends FactoryI < T >> Foo2(F factory) {
        x = factory.create();
    }
    // ...
}

class IntegerFactory implements FactoryI < Integer > {
    public Integer create() {
        return new Integer(0);
    }
}

class Widget {
    public static class Factory implements FactoryI < Widget > {
        public Widget create() {
            return new Widget();
        }
    }
}

public class FactoryConstraint {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Foo2 < Integer > (new IntegerFactory());
        new Foo2 < Widget > (new Widget.Factory());
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that this is really just a variation of passing Class<T>. Both approaches pass factory
objects; Class<T> happens to be the built-in factory object, whereas the above approach
creates an explicit factory object. But you get compile-time checking.

Another approach is the Template Method design pattern. In the following example, get( ) is
the Template Method, and create( ) is defined in the subclass to produce an object of that
type:

```java
//: generics/CreatorGeneric.java

abstract class GenericWithCreate < T > {
    final T element;
    GenericWithCreate() { element = create(); }
    abstract T create();
}

class X {}

class Creator extends GenericWithCreate < X > {
    X create() { return new X(); }
    void f() {
        System.out.println(element.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
}

public class CreatorGeneric {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Creator c = new Creator();
        c.f();
    }
} /* Output:
X
*///:~
```

Exercise 22: (6) Use a type tag along with reflection to create a method that uses the
argument version of newInstance( ) to create an object of a class with a constructor that
has arguments.

Exercise 23: ( 1) Modify FactoryConstraint.java so that create( ) takes an
argument.

Exercise 24: (3) Modify Exercise 21 so that factory objects are held in the Map instead
of Class<?>.


### ‚òò17.8.2. Arrays of generics
As you saw in Erased.java, you can't create arrays of generics. The general solution is to use
an ArrayList everywhere that you are tempted to create an array of generics:

```java
//: generics/ListOfGenerics.java
import java.util.*;

public class ListOfGenerics<T> {
    private List<T> array = new ArrayList<T>();
    public void add(T item) { array.add(item); }
    public T get(int index) { return array.get(index); }
} ///:~
```
Here you get the behavior of an array but the compile-time type safety afforded by generics.
At times, you will still want to create an array of generic types (the ArrayList, for example,
uses arrays internally). Interestingly enough, you can define a reference in a way that makes
the compiler happy. For example:

```java
//: generics/ArrayOfGenericReference.java

class Generic<T> {}

public class ArrayOfGenericReference {
    static Generic<Integer>[] gia;
} ///:~
```
The compiler accepts this without producing warnings. But you can never create an array of
that exact type (including the type parameters), so it's a little confusing. Since all arrays have
the same structure (size of each array slot and array layout) regardless of the type they hold,
it seems that you should be able to create an array of Object and cast that to the desired
array type. This does in fact compile, but it won't run; it produces a ClassCastException:

```java
//: generics/ArrayOfGeneric.java

public class ArrayOfGeneric {
    static final int SIZE = 100;
    static Generic < Integer > [] gia;
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Compiles; produces ClassCastException:
        //! gia = (Generic<Integer>[])new Object[SIZE];
        // Runtime type is the raw (erased) type:
        gia = (Generic < Integer > []) new Generic[SIZE];
        System.out.println(gia.getClass().getSimpleName());
        gia[0] = new Generic < Integer > ();
        //! gia[1] = new Object(); // Compile-time error
        // Discovers type mismatch at compile time:
        //! gia[2] = new Generic<Double>();
    }
} /* Output:
Generic[]
*///:~
```
The problem is that arrays keep track of their actual type, and that type is established at the
point of creation of the array. So even though gia has been cast to a Generic < Integer >[],
that information only exists at compile time (and without the @SuppressWarnings
annotation, you'd get a warning for that cast). At run time, it's still an array of Object, and
that causes problems. The only way to successfully create an array of a generic type is to
create a new array of the erased type, and cast that.

Let's look at a slightly more sophisticated example. Consider a simple generic wrapper
around an array:

```java
//: generics/GenericArray.java

public class GenericArray<T> {
    private T[] array;
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public GenericArray(int sz) {
        array = (T[])new Object[sz];
    }
    public void put(int index, T item) {
        array[index] = item;
    }
    public T get(int index) { return array[index]; }
    // Method that exposes the underlying representation:
    public T[] rep() { return array; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericArray<Integer> gai =
        new GenericArray<Integer>(10);
        // This causes a ClassCastException:
        //! Integer[] ia = gai.rep();
        // This is OK:
        Object[] oa = gai.rep();
    }
} ///:~
```
As before, we can't say T[] array = new T[sz], so we create an array of objects and cast it.
The rep( ) method returns a T[], which in main( ) should be an Integer[] for gai, but if
you call it and try to capture the result as an Integer [] reference, you get a
ClassCastException, again because the actual runtime type is Object[].

If you compile GenericArray .Java after commenting out the @SuppressWarnings
annotation, the compiler produces a warning:

    Note: GenericArray.Java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

In this case, we've gotten a single warning, and we believe that it's about the cast. But if you
really want to make sure, you should compile with -Xlint:unchecked:

    GenericArray.java:7: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast
    found : java.lang.Object[]
    required: T[]
    array = (T[])new Object[sz];
    ^
    1 warning

It is indeed complaining about that cast. Because warnings become noise, the best thing we
could possibly do, once we verify that a particular warning is expected, is to turn it off using
@SuppressWarnings. That way, when a warning does appear, we'll actually investigate it.

Because of erasure, the runtime type of the array can only be Object[]. If we immediately
cast it to T[], then at compile time the actual type of the array is lost, and the compiler may
miss out on some potential error checks. Because of this, it's better to use an Object[] inside
the collection, and add a cast to T when you use an array element. Let's see how that would
look with the GenericArray.java example:

```java
//: generics/GenericArray2.java

public class GenericArray2 < T > {
    private Object[] array;
    public GenericArray2(int sz) {
        array = new Object[sz];
    }
    public void put(int index, T item) {
        array[index] = item;
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public T get(int index) { return (T) array[index]; }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public T[] rep() {
        return (T[]) array; // Warning: unchecked cast
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericArray2 < Integer > gai =
            new GenericArray2 < Integer > (10);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            gai.put(i, i);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            System.out.print(gai.get(i) + " ");
        System.out.println();
        try {
            Integer[] ia = gai.rep();
        } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e); }
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to
[Ljava.lang.Integer;
*///:~
```
Initially, this doesn't look very different, just that the cast has been moved. Without the
¬©SuppressWarnings annotations, you will still get "unchecked" warnings. However, the
internal representation is now Object[] rather than T[]. When get( ) is called, it casts the
object to T, which is in fact the correct type, so that is safe. However, if you call rep( ), it
again attempts to cast the Object[] to a T[], which is still incorrect, and produces a warning
at compile time and an exception at run time. Thus there's no way to subvert the type of the
underlying array, which can only be Object[]. The advantage of treating array internally as
Object[] instead of T[] is that it's less likely that you'll forget the runtime type of the array
and accidentally introduce a bug (although the majority, and perhaps all, of such bugs would
be rapidly detected at run time).

For new code, you should pass in a type token. In that case, the GenericArray looks like
this:

```java
//: generics/GenericArrayWithTypeToken.java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class GenericArrayWithTypeToken < T > {
    private T[] array;
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public GenericArrayWithTypeToken(Class < T > type, int sz) {
        array = (T[]) Array.newInstance(type, sz);
    }
    public void put(int index, T item) {
        array[index] = item;
    }
    public T get(int index) { return array[index]; }
    // Expose the underlying representation:
    public T[] rep() { return array; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GenericArrayWithTypeToken < Integer > gai =
            new GenericArrayWithTypeToken < Integer > (
                Integer.class, 10);
        // This now works:
        Integer[] ia = gai.rep();
    }
} ///:~
```
The type token Class<T> is passed into the constructor in order to recover from the erasure,
so that we can create the actual type of array that we need, although the warning from the
cast must be suppressed with @SuppressWarnings. Once we do get the actual type, we
can return it and get the desired results, as you see in main( ). The runtime type of the array
is the exact type T[].

Unfortunately, if you look at the source code in the Java SE5 standard libraries, you'll see
there are casts from Object arrays to parameterized types everywhere. For example, here's
the copy-ArrayList-from-Collection constructor, after cleaning up and simplifying:

```java
public ArrayList(Collection c) {
    size = c.size();
    elementData = (E[]) new Object[size];
    c.toArray(elementData);
}
```

If you look through ArrayList.java, you'll find plenty of these casts. And what happens
when we compile it?

    Note: ArrayList.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

Sure enough, the standard libraries produce lots of warnings. If you've worked with C,
especially pre-ANSI C, you remember a particular effect of warnings: When you discover you
can ignore them, you do. For that reason, it's best to not issue any kind of message from the
compiler unless the programmer must do something about it.

In his weblog, ¬≥ Neal Gafter (one of the lead developers for Java SE5) points out that he was
lazy when rewriting the Java libraries, and that we should not do what he did. Neal also
points out that he could not fix some of the Java library code without breaking the existing
interface. So even if certain idioms appear in the Java library sources, that's not necessarily
the right way to do it. When you look at library code, you cannot assume that it's an example
that you should follow in your own code.

## üçÄ17.9. Bounds
Bounds were briefly introduced earlier in the chapter (see page 652). Bounds allow you to
place constraints on the parameter types that can be used with generics. Although this allows
you to enforce rules about the types that your generics can be applied to, a potentially more
important effect is that you can call methods that are in your bound types.

Because erasure removes type information, the only methods you can call for an unbounded
generic parameter are those available for Object. If, however, you are able to constrain that
parameter to be a subset of types, then you can call the methods in that subset. To perform
this constraint, Java generics reuse the extends keyword. It's important for you to
understand that extends has a significantly different meaning in the context of generic
bounds than it does ordinarily. This example shows the basics of bounds:

```java
//: generics/BasicBounds.java

interface HasColor { java.awt.Color getColor(); }

class Colored<T extends HasColor> {
    T item;
    Colored(T item) { this.item = item; }
    T getItem() { return item; }
    // The bound allows you to call a method:
    java.awt.Color color() { return item.getColor(); }
}

class Dimension { public int x, y, z; }

// This won't work -- class must be first, then interfaces:
// class ColoredDimension<T extends HasColor & Dimension> {

// Multiple bounds:
class ColoredDimension<T extends Dimension & HasColor> {
    T item;
    ColoredDimension(T item) { this.item = item; }
    T getItem() { return item; }
    java.awt.Color color() { return item.getColor(); }
    int getX() { return item.x; }
    int getY() { return item.y; }
    int getZ() { return item.z; }
}

interface Weight { int weight(); }

// As with inheritance, you can have only one
// concrete class but multiple interfaces:
class Solid<T extends Dimension & HasColor & Weight> {
    T item;
    Solid(T item) { this.item = item; }
    T getItem() { return item; }
    java.awt.Color color() { return item.getColor(); }
    int getX() { return item.x; }
    int getY() { return item.y; }
    int getZ() { return item.z; }
    int weight() { return item.weight(); }
}

class Bounded
    extends Dimension implements HasColor, Weight {
    public java.awt.Color getColor() { return null; }
    public int weight() { return 0; }
}

public class BasicBounds {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solid<Bounded> solid =
        new Solid<Bounded>(new Bounded());
        solid.color();
        solid.getY();
        solid.weight();
    }
} ///:~
```
You might observe that BasicBounds.java seems to contain redundancies that could be
eliminated through inheritance. Here, you can see how each level of inheritance also adds
bounds constraints:

```java
//: generics/InheritBounds.java

class HoldItem<T> {
    T item;
    HoldItem(T item) { this.item = item; }
    T getItem() { return item; }
}

class Colored2<T extends HasColor> extends HoldItem<T> {
    Colored2(T item) { super(item); }
    java.awt.Color color() { return item.getColor(); }
}

class ColoredDimension2<T extends Dimension & HasColor>
extends Colored2<T> {
    ColoredDimension2(T item) { super(item); }
    int getX() { return item.x; }
    int getY() { return item.y; }
    int getZ() { return item.z; }
}

class Solid2<T extends Dimension & HasColor & Weight>
extends ColoredDimension2<T> {
    Solid2(T item) { super(item); }
    int weight() { return item.weight(); }
}

public class InheritBounds {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solid2<Bounded> solid2 =
        new Solid2<Bounded>(new Bounded());
        solid2.color();
        solid2.getY();
        solid2.weight();
    }
} ///:~
```

Holdltem simply holds an object, so this behavior is inherited into Colored2, which also
requires that its parameter conforms to HasColor. ColoredDimension2 and Solid2
further extend the hierarchy and add bounds at each level. Now the methods are inherited
and they don't have to be repeated in each class.

Here's an example with more layers:

```java
//: generics/EpicBattle.java
// Demonstrating bounds in Java generics.
import java.util.*;

interface SuperPower {}
interface XRayVision extends SuperPower {
    void seeThroughWalls();
}
interface SuperHearing extends SuperPower {
    void hearSubtleNoises();
}
interface SuperSmell extends SuperPower {
    void trackBySmell();
}

class SuperHero < POWER extends SuperPower > {
    POWER power;
    SuperHero(POWER power) { this.power = power; }
    POWER getPower() { return power; }
}

class SuperSleuth < POWER extends XRayVision >
extends SuperHero < POWER > {
    SuperSleuth(POWER power) { super(power); }
    void see() { power.seeThroughWalls(); }
}

class CanineHero < POWER extends SuperHearing & SuperSmell >
extends SuperHero < POWER > {
    CanineHero(POWER power) { super(power); }
    void hear() { power.hearSubtleNoises(); }
    void smell() { power.trackBySmell(); }
}

class SuperHearSmell implements SuperHearing, SuperSmell {
    public void hearSubtleNoises() {}
    public void trackBySmell() {}
}

class DogBoy extends CanineHero < SuperHearSmell > {
    DogBoy() { super(new SuperHearSmell()); }
}

public class EpicBattle {
    // Bounds in generic methods:
    static < POWER extends SuperHearing >
        void useSuperHearing(SuperHero < POWER > hero) {
            hero.getPower().hearSubtleNoises();
        }
    static < POWER extends SuperHearing & SuperSmell >
        void superFind(SuperHero < POWER > hero) {
            hero.getPower().hearSubtleNoises();
            hero.getPower().trackBySmell();
        }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DogBoy dogBoy = new DogBoy();
        useSuperHearing(dogBoy);
        superFind(dogBoy);
        // You can do this:
        List < ? extends SuperHearing > audioBoys;
        // But you can't do this:
        // List<? extends SuperHearing & SuperSmell> dogBoys;
    }
} ///:~
```
Notice that wildcards (which we shall study next) are limited to a single bound.

Exercise 25: (2) Create two interfaces and a class that implements both. Create two
generic methods, one whose argument parameter is bounded by the first interface and one
whose argument parameter is bounded by the second interface. Create an instance of the
class that implements both interfaces, and show that it can be used with both generic
methods.

## üçÄ17.10. Wildcards
You've already seen some simple uses of wildcards‚Äîquestion marks in generic argument
expressions‚Äîin the Holding Your Objects chapter and more in the Type Information
chapter. This section will explore the issue more deeply.

We'll start with an example that shows a particular behavior of arrays: You can assign an
array of a derived type to an array reference of the base type:

```java
//: generics/CovariantArrays.java

class Fruit {}
class Apple extends Fruit {}
class Jonathan extends Apple {}
class Orange extends Fruit {}

public class CovariantArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Fruit[] fruit = new Apple[10];
        fruit[0] = new Apple(); // OK
        fruit[1] = new Jonathan(); // OK
        // Runtime type is Apple[], not Fruit[] or Orange[]:
        try {
            // Compiler allows you to add Fruit:
            fruit[0] = new Fruit(); // ArrayStoreException
        } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e); }
        try {
            // Compiler allows you to add Oranges:
            fruit[0] = new Orange(); // ArrayStoreException
        } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e); }
    }
} /* Output:
java.lang.ArrayStoreException: Fruit
java.lang.ArrayStoreException: Orange
*///:~
```
The first line in main( ) creates an array of Apple and assigns it to a reference to an array of
Fruit. This makes sense‚Äîan Apple is a kind of Fruit, so an array of Apple should also be
an array of Fruit.

However, if the actual array type is Apple [], you should only be able to place an Apple or a
subtype of Apple into the array, which in fact works at both compile time and run time. But
notice that the compiler allows you to place a Fruit object into the array. This makes sense to
the compiler, because it has a Fruit[] reference‚Äîwhy shouldn't it allow a Fruit object, or
anything descended from Fruit, such as Orange, to be placed into the array? So at compile

time, this is allowed. The runtime array mechanism, however, knows that it's dealing with an
Apple [] and throws an exception when a foreign type is placed into the array.

"Upcast" is actually rather a misnomer here. What you're really doing is assigning one array
to another. The array behavior is that it holds other objects, but because we are able to
upcast, it's clear that the array objects can preserve the rules about the type of objects they
contain. It's as if the arrays are conscious of what they are holding, so between the compile-
time checks and the runtime checks, you can't abuse them.

This arrangement for arrays is not so terrible, because you do find out at run time that you've
inserted an improper type. But one of the primary goals of generics is to move such error
detection to compile time. So what happens when we try to use generic containers instead of
arrays?

```java
//: generics/NonCovariantGenerics.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)
import java.util.*;

public class NonCovariantGenerics {
    // Compile Error: incompatible types:
    List<Fruit> flist = new ArrayList<Apple>();
```
Although you may at first read this as saying, "You can't assign a container of Apple to a
container of Fruit," remember that generics are not just about containers. What it's really
saying is, "You can't assign a generic involving Apples to a generic involving Fruit." If, as
in the case of arrays, the compiler knew enough about the code to determine that containers
were involved, perhaps it could give some leeway. But it doesn't know anything like that, so it
refuses to allow the "upcast." But it really isn't an "upcast" anyway‚Äîa List of Apple is not a
List of Fruit. A List of Apple will hold Apples and subtypes of Apple, and a List of
Fruit will hold any kind of Fruit. Yes, including Apples, but that doesn't make it a List of
Apple; it's still a List of Fruit. A List of Apple is not type-equivalent to a List of Fruit,
even if an Apple is a type of Fruit.

The real issue is that we are talking about the type of the container, rather than the type that
the container is holding. Unlike arrays, generics do not have built-in covariance. This is
because arrays are completely defined in the language and can thus have both compile-time
and runtime checks built in, but with generics, the compiler and runtime system cannot
know what you want to do with your types and what the rules should be.

Sometimes, however, you'd like to establish some kind of upcasting relationship between the
two. This is what wildcards allow.

```java
//: generics/GenericsAndCovariance.java
import java.util.*;

public class GenericsAndCovariance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Wildcards allow covariance:
        List<? extends Fruit> flist = new ArrayList<Apple>();
        // Compile Error: can't add any type of object:
        // flist.add(new Apple());
        // flist.add(new Fruit());
        // flist.add(new Object());
        flist.add(null); // Legal but uninteresting
        // We know that it returns at least Fruit:
        Fruit f = flist.get(0);
    }
} ///:~
```
The type of flist is now List<? extends Fruit>, which you can read as "a list of any type
that's inherited from Fruit." This doesn't actually mean that the List will hold any type of
Fruit, however. The wildcard refers to a definite type, so it means "some specific type which
the flist reference doesn't specify." So the List that's assigned has to be holding some
specified type such as Fruit or Apple, but in order to upcast to flist, that type is a "don't
actually care."

If the only constraint is that the List hold a specific Fruit or subtype of Fruit, but you don't
actually care what it is, then what can you do with such a List? If you don't know what type
the List is holding, how can you safely add an object? Just as with the "upcast" array in
CovariantArrays.java, you can't, except that the compiler prevents it from happening
rather than the runtime system. You discover the problem sooner.

You might argue that things have gone a bit overboard, because now you can't even add an
Apple to a List that you just said would hold Apples. Yes, but the compiler doesn't know
that. A List<? extends Fruit> could legally point to a List<Orange>. Once you do this
kind of "upcast," you lose the ability to pass anything in, even an Object.

On the other hand, if you call a method that returns Fruit, that's safe because you know that
anything in the List must at least be of type Fruit, so the compiler allows it.

Exercise 26: (2) Demonstrate array covariance using Numbers and Integers.

Exercise 27: (2) Show that covariance doesn't work with Lists, using Numbers and
Integers, then introduce wildcards.

### ‚òò17.10.1. How smart is the compiler?
Now, you might guess that you are prevented from calling any methods that take arguments,
but consider this:

```java
//: generics/CompilerIntelligence.java
import java.util.*;

public class CompilerIntelligence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<? extends Fruit> flist =
            Arrays.asList(new Apple());
        Apple a = (Apple)flist.get(0); // No warning
        flist.contains(new Apple()); // Argument is 'Object'
        flist.indexOf(new Apple()); // Argument is 'Object'
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see calls to contains( ) and indexOf( ) that take Apple objects as arguments, and
those are just fine. Does this mean that the compiler actually examines the code to see if a
particular method modifies its object?

By looking at the documentation for ArrayList, we find that the compiler is not that smart.
While add( ) takes an argument of the generic parameter type, contains( ) and indexOf( )
take arguments of type Object. So when you specify an ArrayList <? extends Fruit >, the
argument for add( ) becomes'? extends Fruit'. From that description, the compiler cannot
know which specific subtype of Fruit is required there, so it won't accept any type of Fruit.
It doesn't matter if you upcast the Apple to a Fruit first‚Äîthe compiler simply refuses to call
a method (such as add( )) if a wildcard is involved in the argument list.

With contains( ) and indexOf( ), the arguments are of type Object, so there are no
wildcards involved and the compiler allows the call. This means that it's up to the generic
class designer to decide which calls are "safe," and to use Object types for their arguments.
To disallow a call when the type is used with wildcards, use the type parameter in the
argument list.

You can see this in a very simple Holder class:

```java
//: generics/Holder.java

public class Holder < T > {
    private T value;
    public Holder() {}
    public Holder(T val) { value = val; }
    public void set(T val) { value = val; }
    public T get() { return value; }
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return value.equals(obj);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Holder < Apple > Apple = new Holder < Apple > (new Apple());
        Apple d = Apple.get();
        Apple.set(d);
        // Holder<Fruit> Fruit = Apple; // Cannot upcast
        Holder < ? extends Fruit > fruit = Apple; // OK
        Fruit p = fruit.get();
        d = (Apple) fruit.get(); // Returns 'Object'
        try {
            Orange c = (Orange) fruit.get(); // No warning
        } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(e); }
        // fruit.set(new Apple()); // Cannot call set()
        // fruit.set(new Fruit()); // Cannot call set()
        System.out.println(fruit.equals(d)); // OK
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
java.lang.ClassCastException: Apple cannot be cast to Orange
true
*///:~
```
Holder has a set( ) which takes a T, a get( ) which returns a T, and an equals( ) that takes
an Object. As you've already seen, if you create a Holder<Apple>, you cannot upcast it to
a Holder<Fruit>, but you can upcast to a Holder<? extends Fruit>. If you call get( ), it
only returns a Fruit‚Äîthat's as much as it knows given the "anything that extends Fruit"
bound. If you know more about what's there, you can cast to a specific type of Fruit and
there won't be any warning about it, but you risk a ClassCastException. The set( ) method
won't work with either an Apple or a Fruit, because the set( ) argument is also "? Extends
Fruit," which means it can be anything and the compiler can't verify type safety for
"anything."

However, the equals( ) method works fine because it takes an Object instead of a T as an
argument. Thus, the compiler is only paying attention to the types of objects that are passed
and returned. It is not analyzing the code to see if you perform any actual writes or reads.

### ‚òò17.10.2. Contravariance
It's also possible to go the other way, and use supertype wildcards. Here, you say that the
wildcard is bounded by any base class of a particular class, by specifying <? super
MyClass> or even using a type parameter: <? super T> (although you cannot give a
generic parameter a supertype bound; that is, you cannot say <T super MyClass>). This
allows you to safely pass a typed object into a generic type. Thus, with supertype wildcards
you can write into a Collection:

```java
//: generics/SuperTypeWildcards.java
import java.util.*;

public class SuperTypeWildcards {
    static void writeTo(List<? super Apple> apples) {
        apples.add(new Apple());
        apples.add(new Jonathan());
        // apples.add(new Fruit()); // Error
    }
} ///:~
```
The argument apples is a List of some type that is the base type of Apple; thus you know
that it is safe to add an Apple or a subtype of Apple. Since the lower bound is Apple,
however, you don't know that it is safe to add Fruit to such a List, because that would allow
the List to be opened up to the addition of non-Apple types, which would violate static type
safety.

You can thus begin to think of subtype and supertype bounds in terms of how you can "write"
(pass into a method) to a generic type, and "read" (return from a method) from a generic
type.

Supertype bounds relax the constraints on what you can pass into a method:

```java
//: generics/GenericWriting.java
import java.util.*;

public class GenericWriting {
    static < T > void writeExact(List < T > list, T item) {
        list.add(item);
    }
    static List < Apple > apples = new ArrayList < Apple > ();
    static List < Fruit > fruit = new ArrayList < Fruit > ();
    static void f1() {
        writeExact(apples, new Apple());
        // writeExact(fruit, new Apple()); // Error:
        // Incompatible types: found Fruit, required Apple
    }
    static < T > void
    writeWithWildcard(List < ? super T > list, T item) {
        list.add(item);
    }
    static void f2() {
        writeWithWildcard(apples, new Apple());
        writeWithWildcard(fruit, new Apple());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) { f1();
        f2(); }
} ///:~
```
The writeExact( ) method uses an exact parameter type (no wildcards). In fi( ) you can see
that this works fine‚Äîas long as you only put an Apple into a List<Apple>. However,
writeExact( ) does not allow you to put an Apple into a List<Fruit>, even though you
know that should be possible.

In writeWithWildcard( ), the argument is now a List<? super T>, so the List holds a
specific type that is derived from T; thus it is safe to pass a T or anything derived from T as an
argument to List methods. You can see this in f2( ), where it's still possible to put an Apple

into a List<Apple>, as before, but it is now also possible to put an Apple into a
List<Fruit>, as you expect.

We can perform this same type of analysis as a review of covariance and wildcards:

```java
//: generics/GenericReading.java
import java.util.*;

public class GenericReading {
    static < T > T readExact(List < T > list) {
        return list.get(0);
    }
    static List < Apple > apples = Arrays.asList(new Apple());
    static List < Fruit > fruit = Arrays.asList(new Fruit());
    // A static method adapts to each call:
    static void f1() {
        Apple a = readExact(apples);
        Fruit f = readExact(fruit);
        f = readExact(apples);
    }
    // If, however, you have a class, then its type is
    // established when the class is instantiated:
    static class Reader < T > {
        T readExact(List < T > list) { return list.get(0); }
    }
    static void f2() {
        Reader < Fruit > fruitReader = new Reader < Fruit > ();
        Fruit f = fruitReader.readExact(fruit);
        // Fruit a = fruitReader.readExact(apples); // Error:
        // readExact(List<Fruit>) cannot be
        // applied to (List<Apple>).
    }
    static class CovariantReader < T > {
        T readCovariant(List < ? extends T > list) {
            return list.get(0);
        }
    }
    static void f3() {
        CovariantReader < Fruit > fruitReader =
            new CovariantReader < Fruit > ();
        Fruit f = fruitReader.readCovariant(fruit);
        Fruit a = fruitReader.readCovariant(apples);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f1();
        f2();
        f3();
    }
} ///:~
```
As before, the first method readExact( ) uses the precise type. So if you use the precise type
with no wildcards, you can both write and read that precise type into and out of a List. In
addition, for the return value, the static generic method readExact( ) effectively "adapts"
to each method call, and returns an Apple from a List<Apple> and a Fruit from a
List<Fruit>, as you can see in f1( ). Thus, if you can get away with a static generic method,
you don't necessarily need covariance if you're just reading.

If you have a generic class, however, the parameter is established for the class when you
make an instance of that class. As you can see in f2( ), the fruitReader instance can read a
piece of Fruit from a List<Fruit>, since that is its exact type. But a List<Apple> should
also produce Fruit objects, and the fruitReader doesn't allow this.

To fix the problem, the CovariantReader.readCovariant( ) method takes a List<?
extends T>, and so it's safe to read a T from that list (you know that everything in that list is
at least a T, and possibly something derived from a T). In f3( ) you can see that it's now
possible to read a Fruit from a List<Apple>.

Exercise 28: (4) Create a generic class Generic1<T> with a single method that takes an
argument of type T. Create a second generic class Generic2<T> with a single method that
returns an argument of type T. Write a generic method with a contravariant argument of the first
generic class that calls its method. Write a second generic method with a covariant argument of
the second generic class that calls its method. Test using the typeinfo.pets library.

### ‚òò17.10.3. Unbounded wildcards
The unbounded wildcard <?> appears to mean "anything," and so using an unbounded
wildcard seems equivalent to using a raw type. Indeed, the compiler seems at first to agree
with this assessment:

```java
//: generics/UnboundedWildcards1.java
import java.util.*;

public class UnboundedWildcards1 {
    static List list1;
    static List < ? > list2;
    static List < ? extends Object > list3;
    static void assign1(List list) {
        list1 = list;
        list2 = list;
        // list3 = list; // Warning: unchecked conversion
        // Found: List, Required: List<? extends Object>
    }
    static void assign2(List < ? > list) {
        list1 = list;
        list2 = list;
        list3 = list;
    }
    static void assign3(List < ? extends Object > list) {
        list1 = list;
        list2 = list;
        list3 = list;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        assign1(new ArrayList());
        assign2(new ArrayList());
        // assign3(new ArrayList()); // Warning:
        // Unchecked conversion. Found: ArrayList
        // Required: List<? extends Object>
        assign1(new ArrayList < String > ());
        assign2(new ArrayList < String > ());
        assign3(new ArrayList < String > ());
        // Both forms are acceptable as List<?>:
        List < ? > wildList = new ArrayList();
        wildList = new ArrayList < String > ();
        assign1(wildList);
        assign2(wildList);
        assign3(wildList);
    }
} ///:~
```

There are many cases like the ones you see here where the compiler could care less whether
you use a raw type or <?>. In those cases, <?> can be thought of as a decoration; and yet it is
valuable because, in effect, it says, "I wrote this code with Java generics in mind, and I don't
mean here that I'm using a raw type, but that in this case the generic parameter can hold any
type."

A second example shows an important use of unbounded wildcards. When you are dealing
with multiple generic parameters, it's sometimes important to allow one parameter to be any
type while establishing a particular type for the other parameter:

```java
//: generics/UnboundedWildcards2.java
import java.util.*;

public class UnboundedWildcards2 {
    static Map map1;
    static Map<?,?> map2;
    static Map<String,?> map3;
    static void assign1(Map map) { map1 = map; }
    static void assign2(Map<?,?> map) { map2 = map; }
    static void assign3(Map<String,?> map) { map3 = map; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        assign1(new HashMap());
        assign2(new HashMap());
        // assign3(new HashMap()); // Warning:
        // Unchecked conversion. Found: HashMap
        // Required: Map<String,?>
        assign1(new HashMap<String,Integer>());
        assign2(new HashMap<String,Integer>());
        assign3(new HashMap<String,Integer>());
    }
} ///:~
```
But again, when you have all unbounded wildcards, as seen in Map<?,?>, the compiler
doesn't seem to distinguish it from a raw Map. In addition, UnboundedWildcards1.java
shows that the compiler treats List<?> and List<? extends Object> differently.

What's confusing is that the compiler doesn't always care about the difference between, for
example, List and List<?>, so they can seem like the same thing. Indeed, since a generic
argument erases to its first bound, List<?> would seem to be equivalent to List<Object>,
and List is effectively List<Object> as well‚Äîexcept neither of those statements is exactly
true. List actually means "a raw List that holds any Object type," whereas List<?> means
"a non-raw List of some specific type, but we just don't know what that type is."
When does the compiler actually care about the difference between raw types and types
involving unbounded wildcards? The following example uses the previously defined
Holder<T> class. It contains methods that take Holder as an argument, but in various
forms: as a raw type, with a specific type parameter, and with an unbounded wildcard
parameter:

```java
//: generics/Wildcards.java
// Exploring the meaning of wildcards.

public class Wildcards {
    // Raw argument:
    static void rawArgs(Holder holder, Object arg) {
        // holder.set(arg); // Warning:
        // Unchecked call to set(T) as a
        // member of the raw type Holder
        // holder.set(new Wildcards()); // Same warning

        // Can't do this; don't have any 'T':
        // T t = holder.get();

        // OK, but type information has been lost:
        Object obj = holder.get();
    }
    // Similar to rawArgs(), but errors instead of warnings:
    static void unboundedArg(Holder < ? > holder, Object arg) {
        // holder.set(arg); // Error:
        // set(capture of ?) in Holder<capture of ?>
        // cannot be applied to (Object)
        // holder.set(new Wildcards()); // Same error

        // Can't do this; don't have any 'T':
        // T t = holder.get();

        // OK, but type information has been lost:
        Object obj = holder.get();
    }
    static < T > T exact1(Holder < T > holder) {
        T t = holder.get();
        return t;
    }
    static < T > T exact2(Holder < T > holder, T arg) {
        holder.set(arg);
        T t = holder.get();
        return t;
    }
    static < T >
    T wildSubtype(Holder < ? extends T > holder, T arg) {
        // holder.set(arg); // Error:
        // set(capture of ? extends T) in
        // Holder<capture of ? extends T>
        // cannot be applied to (T)
        T t = holder.get();
        return t;
    }
    static < T >
    void wildSupertype(Holder < ? super T > holder, T arg) {
        holder.set(arg);
        // T t = holder.get(); // Error:
        // Incompatible types: found Object, required T

        // OK, but type information has been lost:
        Object obj = holder.get();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Holder raw = new Holder < Long > ();
        // Or:
        raw = new Holder();
        Holder < Long > qualified = new Holder < Long > ();
        Holder < ? > unbounded = new Holder < Long > ();
        Holder < ? extends Long > bounded = new Holder < Long > ();
        Long lng = 1 L;

        rawArgs(raw, lng);
        rawArgs(qualified, lng);
        rawArgs(unbounded, lng);
        rawArgs(bounded, lng);

        unboundedArg(raw, lng);
        unboundedArg(qualified, lng);
        unboundedArg(unbounded, lng);

        unboundedArg(bounded, lng);

        // Object r1 = exact1(raw); // Warnings:
        // Unchecked conversion from Holder to Holder<T>
        // Unchecked method invocation: exact1(Holder<T>)
        // is applied to (Holder)
        Long r2 = exact1(qualified);
        Object r3 = exact1(unbounded); // Must return Object
        Long r4 = exact1(bounded);

        // Long r5 = exact2(raw, lng); // Warnings:
        // Unchecked conversion from Holder to Holder<Long>
        // Unchecked method invocation: exact2(Holder<T>,T)
        // is applied to (Holder,Long)
        Long r6 = exact2(qualified, lng);
        // Long r7 = exact2(unbounded, lng); // Error:
        // exact2(Holder<T>,T) cannot be applied to
        // (Holder<capture of ?>,Long)
        // Long r8 = exact2(bounded, lng); // Error:
        // exact2(Holder<T>,T) cannot be applied
        // to (Holder<capture of ? extends Long>,Long)

        // Long r9 = wildSubtype(raw, lng); // Warnings:

        // applied to (Holder,Long)
        Long r10 = wildSubtype(qualified, lng);
        // OK, but can only return Object:
        Object r11 = wildSubtype(unbounded, lng);
        Long r12 = wildSubtype(bounded, lng);

        // wildSupertype(raw, lng); // Warnings:

        // wildSupertype(Holder<? super T>,T) cannot be
        // applied to (Holder<capture of ? extends Long>,Long)
    }
} ///:~
```
In rawArgs( ), the compiler knows that Holder is a generic type, so even though it is
expressed as a raw type here, the compiler knows that passing an Object to set( ) is unsafe.
Since it's a raw type, you can pass an object of any type into set( ), and that object is upcast
to Object. So anytime you have a raw type, you give up compile-time checking. The call to
get( ) shows the same issue: There's no T, so the result can only be an Object.

It's easy to start thinking that a raw Holder and a Holder<?> are roughly the same thing.
But unboundedArg( ) emphasizes that they are differentit discovers the same kind of
problems, but reports them as errors rather than warnings, because the raw Holder will
hold a combination of any types, whereas a Holder<?> holds a homogeneous collection of
some specific type, and thus you can't just pass in an Object.

In exact1( ) and exact2( ), you see the exact generic parameters used‚Äîno wildcards. You'll
see that exact2( ) has different limitations than exact1( ), because of the extra argument.
In wildSubtype( ), the constraints on the type of Holder are relaxed to include a Holder
of anything that extends T. Again, this means that T could be Fruit, while holder could
legitimately be a Holder<Apple>. To prevent putting an Orange in a Holder<Apple>,
the call to set( ) (or any method that takes an argument of the type parameter) is disallowed.
However, you still know that anything that comes out of a Holder<? extends Fruit> will
at least be Fruit, so get( ) (or any method that produces a return value of the type
parameter) is allowed.

Supertype wildcards are shown in wildSupertype( ), which shows the opposite behavior of
wildSubtype( ): holder can be a container that holds any type that's a base class of T.
Thus, set( ) can accept a T, since anything that works with a base type will polymorphically
work with a derived type (thus a T). However, trying to call get( ) is not helpful, because the
type held by holder can be any supertype at all, so the only safe one is Object.

This example also shows the limitations on what you can and can't do with an unbounded
parameter in unbounded( ): You can't get( ) or set( ) a T because you don't have a T.
In main( ) you can see which of these methods can accept which types of arguments without
errors and warnings. For migration compatibility, rawArgs( ) will take all the different
variations of Holder without producing warnings. The unboundedArg( ) method is
equally accepting of all types, although, as previously noted, it handles them differently
inside the body of the method.

If you pass a raw Holder reference into a method that takes an "exact" generic type (no
wildcards), you get a warning because the exact argument is expecting information that
doesn't exist in the raw type. And if you pass an unbounded reference to exact1( ), there's no
type information to establish the return type.

You can see that exact2( ) has the most constraints, since it wants exactly a Holder<T>
and an argument of type T, and because of this it generates errors or warnings unless you
give it the exact arguments. Sometimes this is OK, but if it's overconstraining, then you can
use wildcards, depending on whether you want to get typed return values from your generic
argument (as seen in wildSubtype( )) or you want to pass typed arguments to your generic
argument (as seen in wildSupertype( )).

Thus, the benefit of using exact types instead of wildcard types is that you can do more with
the generic parameters. But using wildcards allows you to accept a broader range of
parameterized types as arguments. You must decide which trade-off is more appropriate for
your needs on a case-by-case basis.

### ‚òò17.10.4. Capture conversion
One situation in particular requires the use of <?> rather than a raw type. If you pass a raw
type to a method that uses <?>, it's possible for the compiler to infer the actual type
parameter, so that the method can turn around and call another method that uses the exact
type. The following example demonstrates the technique, which is called capture conversion
because the unspecified wildcard type is captured and converted to an exact type. Here, the
comments about warnings only take effect when the @SuppressWarnings annotation is
removed:

```java
//: generics/CaptureConversion.java

public class CaptureConversion {
    static < T > void f1(Holder < T > holder) {
        T t = holder.get();
        System.out.println(t.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
    static void f2(Holder < ? > holder) {
        f1(holder); // Call with captured type
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Holder raw = new Holder < Integer > (1);
        // f1(raw); // Produces warnings
        f2(raw); // No warnings
        Holder rawBasic = new Holder();
        rawBasic.set(new Object()); // Warning
        f2(rawBasic); // No warnings
        // Upcast to Holder<?>, still figures it out:
        Holder < ? > wildcarded = new Holder < Double > (1.0);
        f2(wildcarded);
    }
} /* Output:
Integer
Object
Double
*///:~
```
The type parameters in f1( ) are all exact, without wildcards or bounds. In f2( ), the Holder
parameter is an unbounded wildcard, so it would seem to be effectively unknown. However,
within f2( ), f1( ) is called and f1( ) requires a known parameter. What's happening is that
the parameter type is captured in the process of calling f2( ), so it can be used in the call to
f1( ).

You might wonder if this technique could be used for writing, but that would require you to
pass a specific type along with the Holder<?>. Capture conversion only works in situations
where, within the method, you need to work with the exact type. Notice that you can't return
T from f2( ), because T is unknown for f2( ). Capture conversion is interesting, but quite
limited.

Exercise 29: (5) Create a generic method that takes as an argument a
Holder<List<?>>. Determine what methods you can and can't call for the Holder and for
the List. Repeat for an argument of List<Holder<?>>.

## üçÄ17.11. Issues
This section addresses an assorted set of issues that appear when you are using Java generics.

### ‚òò17.11.1. No primitives as type parameters
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, one of the limitations you will discover in Java generics
is that you cannot use primitives as type parameters. So you cannot, for example, create an
ArrayList<int>.

The solution is to use the primitive wrapper classes in conjunction with Java SE5 autoboxing.
If you create an ArrayList< Integer> and use primitive ints with this container, you'll
discover that autoboxing does the conversion to and from Integer automatically‚Äîso it's
almost as if you have an ArrayList < int >:

```java
//: generics/ListOfInt.java
// Autoboxing compensates for the inability to use
// primitives in generics.
import java.util.*;

public class ListOfInt {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Integer > li = new ArrayList < Integer > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            li.add(i);
        for (int i: li)
            System.out.print(i + " ");
    }
} /* Output:
0 1 2 3 4
*///:~
```
Note that autoboxing even allows the foreach syntax to produce ints.

In general this solution works fine‚Äîyou're able to successfully store and retrieve ints. There
happen to be some conversions going on but these are hidden from you. However, if
performance is a problem, you can use a specialized version of the containers adapted for
primitive types; one opensource version of this is
org.apache.commons.collections.primitives.

Here's another approach, which creates a Set of Bytes:

```java
//: generics/ByteSet.java
import java.util.*;

public class ByteSet {
    Byte[] possibles = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 };
    Set<Byte> mySet =
        new HashSet<Byte>(Arrays.asList(possibles));
    // But you can't do this:
    // Set<Byte> mySet2 = new HashSet<Byte>(
    // Arrays.<Byte>asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9));
} ///:~
```
Notice that autoboxing solves some problems, but not all. The following example shows a
generic Generator interface that specifies a next( ) that returns an object of the parameter
type. The FArray class contains a generic method that uses a generator to fill an array with
objects (making the class generic wouldn't work in this case because the method is static).
The Generator implementations come from the Arrays chapter, and in main( ) you can
see FArray.fill( ) used to fill arrays with objects:

```java
//: generics/PrimitiveGenericTest.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

// Fill an array using a generator:
class FArray {
    public static < T > T[] fill(T[] a, Generator < T > gen) {
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
            a[i] = gen.next();
        return a;
    }
}

public class PrimitiveGenericTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] strings = FArray.fill(
            new String[7], new RandomGenerator.String(10));
        for (String s: strings)
            System.out.println(s);
        Integer[] integers = FArray.fill(
            new Integer[7], new RandomGenerator.Integer());
        for (int i: integers)
            System.out.println(i);
        // Autoboxing won't save you here. This won't compile:
        // int[] b =
        // FArray.fill(new int[7], new RandIntGenerator());
    }

Since RandomGenerator.Integer implements Generator<Integer>, my hope was that
autoboxing would automatically convert the value of next( ) from Integer to int. However,
autoboxing doesn't apply to arrays, so this won't work.

Exercise 30: (2) Create a Holder for each of the primitive wrapper types, and show that
autoboxing and autounboxing works for the set( ) and get( ) methods of each instance.

### ‚òò17.11.2. Implementing parameterized interfaces
A class cannot implement two variants of the same generic interface. Because of erasure,
these are both the same interface. Here's a situation where this clash occurs:

```java
//: generics/MultipleInterfaceVariants.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

interface Payable<T> {}

class Employee implements Payable<Employee> {}
class Hourly extends Employee
implements Payable<Hourly> {} ///:~
```
Hourly won't compile because erasure reduces Payable<Employee> and
Payable<Hourly> to the same class, Payable, and the above code would mean that you'd
be implementing the same interface twice. Interestingly enough, if you remove the generic
parameters from both uses of Payable‚Äîas the compiler does during erasure‚Äîthe code
compiles.

This issue can become annoying when you are working with some of the more fundamental
Java interfaces, such as Comparable<T>, as you'll see a little later in this section.

Exercise 31: (1) Remove all the generics from MultipleInterfaceVariants.java and
modify the code so that the example compiles.

### ‚òò17.11.3. Casting and warnings
Using a cast or instanceof with a generic type parameter doesn't have any effect. The
following container stores values internally as Objects and casts them back to T when you
fetch them:

```java
//: generics/GenericCast.java

class FixedSizeStack < T > {
    private int index = 0;
    private Object[] storage;
    public FixedSizeStack(int size) {
        storage = new Object[size];
    }
    public void push(T item) { storage[index++] = item; }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public T pop() { return (T) storage[--index]; }
}

public class GenericCast {
    public static final int SIZE = 10;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FixedSizeStack < String > strings =
            new FixedSizeStack < String > (SIZE);
        for (String s: "A B C D E F G H I J".split(" "))
            strings.push(s);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            String s = strings.pop();
            System.out.print(s + " ");
        }
    }
} /* Output:
J I H G F E D C B A
*///:~
```
Without the @SuppressWarnings annotation, the compiler will produce an "unchecked
cast" warning for pop( ). Because of erasure, it can't know whether the cast is safe, and the
pop( ) method doesn't actually do any casting. T is erased to its first bound, which is Object
by default, so pop( ) is actually just casting an Object to an Object.

There are times when generics do not eliminate the need to cast, and this generates a
warning by the compiler which is inappropriate. For example:

```java
//: generics/NeedCasting.java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class NeedCasting {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public void f(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(
        new FileInputStream(args[0]));
        List<Widget> shapes = (List<Widget>)in.readObject();
    }
} ///:~
```
As you'll learn in the next chapter, readObject( ) cannot know what it is reading, so it
returns an object that must be cast. But when you comment out the @SuppressWarnings
annotation and compile the program, you get a warning:

    Note: NeedCasting.Java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
    And if you follow the instructions and recompile with -Xlint:unchecked:
    NeedCasting.Java:12: warning: [unchecked] unchecked cast
    found : java.lang.Object
    required: java.uti1.List<Widget>
    List<Shape> shapes = (List<Widget>)in.readObject();

You're forced to cast, and yet you're told you shouldn't. To solve the problem, you must use a
new form of cast introduced in Java SE5, the cast via a generic class:

```java
//: generics/ClassCasting.java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ClassCasting {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public void f(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(
        new FileInputStream(args[0]));
        // Won't Compile:
        // List<Widget> lw1 =
        // List<Widget>.class.cast(in.readObject());
        List<Widget> lw2 = List.class.cast(in.readObject());
    }
} ///:~
```
However, you can't cast to the actual type (List<Widget>). That is, you can't say

    List<Widget>.class.cast(in.readObject())

and even if you add another cast like this:

    (List<Widget>)List.class.cast(in.readObject())

you'll still get a warning.

Exercise 32: (1) Verify that FixedSizeStack in GenericCast.java generates
exceptions if you try to go out of its bounds. Does this mean that bounds-checking code is not
required?

Exercise 33: (3) Repair GenericCast.java using an ArrayList.

### ‚òò17.11.4. Overloading
This won't compile, even though it's a reasonable thing to try:

```java
//: generics/UseList.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)
import java.util.*;

public class UseList<W,T> {
    void f(List<T> v) {}
    void f(List<W> v) {}
} ///:~
```
Overloading the method produces the identical type signature because of erasure.

Instead, you must provide distinct method names when the erased arguments do not
produce a unique argument list:

```java
//: generics/UseList2.java
import java.util.*;

public class UseList2<W,T> {
    void f1(List<T> v) {}
    void f2(List<W> v) {}
} ///:~
```
Fortunately, this kind of problem is detected by the compiler.

### ‚òò17.11.5. Base class hijacks an interface
Suppose you have a Pet class that is Comparable to other Pet objects:

```java
//: generics/ComparablePet.java

public class ComparablePet
    implements Comparable<ComparablePet> {
    public int compareTo(ComparablePet arg) { return 0; }
} ///:~
```
It makes sense to try to narrow the type that a subclass of ComparablePet can be
compared to. For example, a Cat should only be Comparable with other Cats:

```java
//: generics/HijackedInterface.java
// {CompileTimeError} (Won't compile)

class Cat extends ComparablePet implements Comparable<Cat>{
    // Error: Comparable cannot be inherited with
    // different arguments: <Cat> and <Pet>
    public int compareTo(Cat arg) { return 0; }
} ///:~
```
Unfortunately, this won't work. Once the ComparablePet argument is established for
Comparable, no other implementing class can ever be compared to anything but a
ComparablePet:

```java
//: generics/RestrictedComparablePets.java


class Hamster extends ComparablePet
implements Comparable<ComparablePet> {
    public int compareTo(ComparablePet arg) { return 0; }
}

// Or just:

class Gecko extends ComparablePet {
    public int compareTo(ComparablePet arg) { return 0; }
} ///:~
```
Hamster shows that it is possible to reimplement the same interface that is in
ComparablePet, as long as it is exactly the same, including the parameter types. However,
this is the same as just overriding the methods in the base class, as seen in Gecko.

## üçÄ17.12. Self-bounded types
There's one rather mind-bending idiom that appears periodically in Java generics. Here's
what it looks like:

class SelfBounded<T extends SelfBounded<T>> { // ...

This has the dizzying effect of two mirrors pointed at each other, a kind of infinite reflection.
The class SelfBounded takes a generic argument T, T is constrained by a bound, and that
bound is SelfBounded, with T as an argument.

This is difficult to parse when you first see it, and it emphasizes that the extends keyword,
when used with bounds, is definitely different than when it is used to create subclasses.

### ‚òò17.12.1. Curiously recurring generics
To understand what a self-bounded type means, let's start with a simpler version of the
idiom, without the self-bound.

You can't inherit directly from a generic parameter. However, you can inherit from a class
that uses that generic parameter in its own definition. That is, you can say:

```java
//: generics/CuriouslyRecurringGeneric.java

class GenericType<T> {}

public class CuriouslyRecurringGeneric
extends GenericType<CuriouslyRecurringGeneric> {} ///:~
```
This could be called curiously recurring generics (CRG) after Jim Coplien's Curiously
Recurring Template Pattern in C++. The "curiously recurring" part refers to the fact that
your class appears, rather curiously, in its own base class.

To understand what this means, try saying it aloud: "I'm creating a new class that inherits
from a generic type that takes my class name as its parameter." What can the generic base
type accomplish when given the derived class name? Well, generics in Java are about
arguments and return types, so it can produce a base class that uses the derived type for its
arguments and return types. It can also use the derived type for field types, even though
those will be erased to Object. Here's a generic class that expresses this:

```java
//: generics/BasicHolder.java

public class BasicHolder<T> {
    T element;
    void set(T arg) { element = arg; }
    T get() { return element; }
    void f() {
        System.out.println(element.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
} ///:~
```
It's an ordinary generic type with methods that both accept and produce objects of the
parameter type, along with a method that operates on the stored field (although it only
performs Object operations on that field).

We can use BasicHolder in a curiously recurring generic:

```java
//: generics/CRGWithBasicHolder.java

class Subtype extends BasicHolder<Subtype> {}

public class CRGWithBasicHolder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subtype st1 = new Subtype(), st2 = new Subtype();
        st1.set(st2);
        Subtype st3 = st1.get();
        st1.f();
    }
} /* Output:
Subtype
*///:~
```
Notice something important here: The new class Subtype takes arguments and returns
values of Subtype, not just the base class BasicHolder. This is the essence of CRG: The
base class substitutes the derived class for its parameters. This means that the generic base
class becomes a kind of template for common functionality for all its derived classes, but this
functionality will use the derived type for all of its arguments and return values. That is, the
exact type instead of the base type will be used in the resulting class. So in Subtype, both the
argument to set( ) and the return type of get( ) are exactly Subtypes.

### ‚òò17.12.2. Self-bounding
The BasicHolder can use any type as its generic parameter, as seen here:

```java
//: generics/Unconstrained.java

class Other {}
class BasicOther extends BasicHolder<Other> {}

public class Unconstrained {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BasicOther b = new BasicOther(), b2 = new BasicOther();
        b.set(new Other());
        Other other = b.get();
        b.f();
    }
} /* Output:
Other
*///:~
```
Self-bounding takes the extra step of forcing the generic to be used as its own bound
argument. Look at how the resulting class can and can't be used:

```java
//: generics/SelfBounding.java

class SelfBounded < T extends SelfBounded < T >> {
    T element;
    SelfBounded < T > set(T arg) {
        element = arg;
        return this;
    }
    T get() { return element; }
}

class A extends SelfBounded < A > {}
class B extends SelfBounded < A > {} // Also OK

class C extends SelfBounded < C > {
    C setAndGet(C arg) { set(arg); return get(); }
}

class D {}
// Can't do this:
// class E extends SelfBounded<D> {}
// Compile error: Type parameter D is not within its bound

// Alas, you can do this, so you can't force the idiom:
class F extends SelfBounded {}

public class SelfBounding {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        a.set(new A());
        a = a.set(new A()).get();
        a = a.get();
        C c = new C();
        c = c.setAndGet(new C());
    }
} ///:~
```
What self-bounding does is require the use of the class in an inheritance relationship like this:

class A extends SelfBounded<A> {}

This forces you to pass the class that you are defining as a parameter to the base class.
What's the added value in self-bounding the parameter? The type parameter must be the
same as the class being defined. As you can see in the definition of class B, you can also
derive from a SelfBounded that uses a parameter of another SelfBounded, although the
predominant use seems to be the one that you see for class A. The attempt to define E shows
that you cannot use a type parameter that is not a SelfBounded.

Unfortunately, F compiles without warnings, so the self-bounding idiom is not enforceable. If
it's really important, it may require an external tool to ensure that raw types are not being
used in place of parameterized types.

Notice that you can remove the constraint and all the classes will still compile, but E will also
compile:

```java
//: generics/NotSelfBounded.java

public class NotSelfBounded < T > {
    T element;
    NotSelfBounded < T > set(T arg) {
        element = arg;
        return this;
    }
    T get() { return element; }
}

class A2 extends NotSelfBounded < A2 > {}
class B2 extends NotSelfBounded < A2 > {}

class C2 extends NotSelfBounded < C2 > {
    C2 setAndGet(C2 arg) { set(arg); return get(); }
}

class D2 {}
// Now this is OK:
class E2 extends NotSelfBounded<D2> {} ///:~
```
So clearly, the self-bounding constraint serves only to force the inheritance relationship. If
you use self-bounding, you know that the type parameter used by the class will be the same
basic type as the class that's using that parameter. It forces anyone using that class to follow
that form.

It's also possible to use self-bounding for generic methods:

```java
//: generics/SelfBoundingMethods.java

public class SelfBoundingMethods {
    static <T extends SelfBounded<T>> T f(T arg) {
        return arg.set(arg).get();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = f(new A());
    }
} ///:~
```
This prevents the method from being applied to anything but a self-bounded argument of the
form shown.

### ‚òò17.12.3. Argument covariance
The value of self-bounding types is that they produce covariant argument types‚Äîmethod
argument types vary to follow the subclasses.

Although self-bounding types also produce return types that are the same as the subclass
type, this is not so important because covariant return types were introduced in Java SE5:

```java
//: generics/CovariantReturnTypes.java

class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {}

interface OrdinaryGetter {
    Base get();
}

interface DerivedGetter extends OrdinaryGetter {
    // Return type of overridden method is allowed to vary:
    Derived get();
}

public class CovariantReturnTypes {
    void test(DerivedGetter d) {
        Derived d2 = d.get();
    }
} ///:~
```
The get( ) method in DerivedGetter overrides get( ) in OrdinaryGetter and returns a
type that is derived from the type returned by OrdinaryGetter.get( ). Although this is a
perfectly logical thing to do‚Äîa derived type method should be able to return a more specific type
than the base type method that it's overriding‚Äîit was illegal in earlier versions of Java.

A self-bounded generic does in fact produce the exact derived type as a return value, as seen here
with get( ):

```java
//: generics/GenericsAndReturnTypes.java

interface GenericGetter<T extends GenericGetter<T>> {
    T get();
}

interface Getter extends GenericGetter<Getter> {}

public class GenericsAndReturnTypes {
    void test(Getter g) {
        Getter result = g.get();
        GenericGetter gg = g.get(); // Also the base type
    }
} ///:~
```
Notice that this code would not have compiled unless covariant return types were included in
Java SE5.

In non-generic code, however, the argument types cannot be made to vary with the subtypes:

```java
//: generics/OrdinaryArguments.java

class OrdinarySetter {
    void set(Base base) {
        System.out.println("OrdinarySetter.set(Base)");
    }
}

class DerivedSetter extends OrdinarySetter {
    void set(Derived derived) {
        System.out.println("DerivedSetter.set(Derived)");
    }
}

public class OrdinaryArguments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base base = new Base();
        Derived derived = new Derived();
        DerivedSetter ds = new DerivedSetter();
        ds.set(derived);
        ds.set(base); // Compiles: overloaded, not overridden!
    }
} /* Output:
DerivedSetter.set(Derived)
OrdinarySetter.set(Base)
*///:~
```
Both set(derived) and set(base) are legal, so DerivedSetter.set( ) is not overriding
OrdinarySetter.set( ), but instead it is overloading that method. From the output, you can
see that there are two methods in DerivedSetter, so the base-class version is still available,
thus verifying that it has been overloaded.

However, with self-bounding types, there is only one method in the derived class, and that
method takes the derived type as its argument, not the base type:

```java
//: generics/SelfBoundingAndCovariantArguments.java

interface SelfBoundSetter<T extends SelfBoundSetter<T>> {
    void set(T arg);
}

interface Setter extends SelfBoundSetter<Setter> {}

public class SelfBoundingAndCovariantArguments {
    void testA(Setter s1, Setter s2, SelfBoundSetter sbs) {
        s1.set(s2);
        // s1.set(sbs); // Error:
        // set(Setter) in SelfBoundSetter<Setter>
        // cannot be applied to (SelfBoundSetter)
    }
} ///:~
```
The compiler doesn't recognize the attempt to pass in the base type as an argument to set( ),
because there is no method with that signature. The argument has, in effect, been overridden.
Without self-bounding, the ordinary inheritance mechanism steps in, and you get
overloading, just as with the non-generic case:

```java
//: generics/PlainGenericInheritance.java

class GenericSetter < T > { // Not self-bounded
    void set(T arg) {
        System.out.println("GenericSetter.set(Base)");
    }
}

class DerivedGS extends GenericSetter < Base > {
    void set(Derived derived) {
        System.out.println("DerivedGS.set(Derived)");
    }
}

public class PlainGenericInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base base = new Base();
        Derived derived = new Derived();
        DerivedGS dgs = new DerivedGS();
        dgs.set(derived);
        dgs.set(base); // Compiles: overloaded, not overridden!
    }
} /* Output:
DerivedGS.set(Derived)
GenericSetter.set(Base)
*///:~
```
This code mimics OrdinaryArguments.java; in that example, DerivedSetter inherits
from OrdinarySetter which contains a set(Base). Here, DerivedGS inherits from
GenericSetter<Base> which also contains a set(Base), created by the generic. And just
like OrdinaryArguments.java, you can see from the output that DerivedGS contains
two overloaded versions of set( ). Without self-bounding, you overload on argument types. If
you use self-bounding, you only end up with one version of a method, which takes the exact
argument type.

Exercise 34 : (4) Create a self-bounded generic type that contains an abstract method
that takes an argument of the generic type parameter and produces a return value of the
generic type parameter. In a non-abstract method of the class, call the abstract method
and return its result. Inherit from the self-bounded type and test the resulting class.

## üçÄ17.13. Dynamic type safety
Because you can pass generic containers to pre-Java SE5 code, there's still the possibility that
old-style code can corrupt your containers. Java SE5 has a set of utilities in
java.util.Collections to solve the type-checking problem in this situation: the static
methods checkedCollection( ), checkedList( ), checkedMap( ), checkedSet( ),
checkedSortedMap( ) and checkedSortedSet( ). Each of these takes the container you
want to dynamically check as the first argument and the type that you want to enforce as the
second argument.

A checked container will throw a ClassCastException at the point you try to insert an
improper object, as opposed to a pre-generic (raw) container which would inform you that
there was a problem when you pulled the object out. In the latter case, you know there's a
problem but you don't know who the culprit is, but with checked containers you find out who
tried to insert the bad object.

Let's look at the problem of "putting a cat in a list of dogs" using a checked container. 
Here, oldStyleMethod( ) represents legacy code because it takes a raw List, and the
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation is necessary to suppress the resulting warning:

```java
//: generics/CheckedList.java
// Using Collection.checkedList().
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CheckedList {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    static void oldStyleMethod(List probablyDogs) {
        probablyDogs.add(new Cat());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < Dog > dogs1 = new ArrayList < Dog > ();
        oldStyleMethod(dogs1); // Quietly accepts a Cat
        List < Dog > dogs2 = Collections.checkedList(
            new ArrayList < Dog > (), Dog.class);
        try {
            oldStyleMethod(dogs2); // Throws an exception
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        // Derived types work fine:
        List < Pet > pets = Collections.checkedList(
            new ArrayList < Pet > (), Pet.class);
        pets.add(new Dog());
        pets.add(new Cat());
    }
} /* Output:
java.lang.ClassCastException: Attempt to insert class typeinfo.pets.Cat
element into collection with element type class typeinfo.pets.Dog
*///:~
```
When you run the program you'll see that the insertion of a Cat goes unchallenged by dogs1,
but dogs2 immediately throws an exception upon the insertion of an incorrect type. You can
also see that it's fine to put derived-type objects into a checked container that is checking for
the base type.

Exercise 35: (1) Modify CheckedList.java so that it uses the Coffee classes defined in
this chapter.

## üçÄ17.14. Exceptions
Because of erasure, the use of generics with exceptions is extremely limited. A catch clause
cannot catch an exception of a generic type, because the exact type of the exception must be
known at both compile time and run time. Also, a generic class can't directly or indirectly
inherit from Throwable (this further prevents you from trying to define generic exceptions
that can't be caught).

However, type parameters may be used in the throws clause of a method declaration. This
allows you to write generic code that varies with the type of a checked exception:

```java
//: generics/ThrowGenericException.java
import java.util.*;

interface Processor < T, E extends Exception > {
    void process(List < T > resultCollector) throws E;
}

class ProcessRunner < T, E extends Exception >
    extends ArrayList < Processor < T, E >> {
        List < T > processAll() throws E {
            List < T > resultCollector = new ArrayList < T > ();
            for (Processor < T, E > processor: this)
                processor.process(resultCollector);
            return resultCollector;
        }
    }

class Failure1 extends Exception {}

class Processor1 implements Processor < String, Failure1 > {
    static int count = 3;
    public void
    process(List < String > resultCollector) throws Failure1 {
        if (count-- > 1)
            resultCollector.add("Hep!");
        else
            resultCollector.add("Ho!");
        if (count < 0)
            throw new Failure1();
    }
}

class Failure2 extends Exception {}

class Processor2 implements Processor < Integer, Failure2 > {
    static int count = 2;
    public void
    process(List < Integer > resultCollector) throws Failure2 {
        if (count-- == 0)
            resultCollector.add(47);
        else {
            resultCollector.add(11);
        }
        if (count < 0)
            throw new Failure2();
    }
}

public class ThrowGenericException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProcessRunner < String, Failure1 > runner =
            new ProcessRunner < String, Failure1 > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            runner.add(new Processor1());
        try {
            System.out.println(runner.processAll());
        } catch (Failure1 e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }

        ProcessRunner < Integer, Failure2 > runner2 =
            new ProcessRunner < Integer, Failure2 > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            runner2.add(new Processor2());
        try {
            System.out.println(runner2.processAll());
        } catch (Failure2 e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
A Processor performs a process( ) and may throw an exception of type E. The result of the
process( ) is stored in the List<T> resultCollector (this is called a collecting
parameter). A ProcessRunner has a processAll( ) method that executes every Process
object that it holds, and returns the resultCollector.

If you could not parameterize the exceptions that are thrown, you would be unable to write
this code generically because of the checked exceptions.

Exercise 36: (2) Add a second parameterized exception to the Processor class and
demonstrate that the exceptions can vary independently.

### ‚òò17.14.1. Mixins
The term mixin seems to have acquired numerous meanings over time, but the fundamental
concept is that of mixing in capabilities from multiple classes in order to produce a resulting
class that represents all the types of the mixins. This is often something you do at the last
minute, which makes it convenient to easily assemble classes.

One value of mixins is that they consistently apply characteristics and behaviors across
multiple classes. As a bonus, if you want to change something in a mixin class, those changes
are then applied across all the classes where the mixin is applied. Because of this, mixins
have part of the flavor of aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and aspects are often
suggested to solve the mixin problem.

### ‚òò17.14.2. Mixins in C++
One of the strongest arguments made for multiple inheritance in C++ is for the use of mixins.
However, a more interesting and elegant approach to mixins is using parameterized types,
whereby a mixin is a class that inherits from its type parameter. In C++, you can easily create
mixins because C++ remembers the type of its template parameters.

Here's a C++ example with two mixin types: one that allows you to mix in the property of
having a time stamp, and another that mixes in a serial number for each object instance:

```cpp
//: generics/Mixins.cpp
#include <string>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template < class T > class TimeStamped: public T {
    long timeStamp;
public:
    TimeStamped() { timeStamp = time(0); }
    long getStamp() { return timeStamp; }
};

template < class T > class SerialNumbered: public T {
    long serialNumber;
    static long counter;
public:
    SerialNumbered() { serialNumber = counter++; }
    long getSerialNumber() { return serialNumber; }
};

// Define and initialize the static storage:
template < class T > long SerialNumbered < T > ::counter = 1;

class Basic {
    string value;
public:
    void set(string val) { value = val; }
    string get() { return value; }
};

int main() {
    TimeStamped < SerialNumbered < Basic > > mixin1, mixin2;
    mixin1.set("test string 1");
    mixin2.set("test string 2");
    cout << mixin1.get() << " " << mixin1.getStamp() <<
        " " << mixin1.getSerialNumber() << endl;
    cout << mixin2.get() << " " << mixin2.getStamp() <<
        " " << mixin2.getSerialNumber() << endl;
} /* Output: (Sample)
test string 1 1129840250 1
test string 2 1129840250 2
*///:~
```
In main( ), the resulting type of mixin1 and mixin2 has all the methods of the mixed-in
types. You can think of a mixin as a function that maps existing classes to new subclasses.
Notice how trivial it is to create a mixin using this technique; basically, you just say, "Here's
what I want," and it happens:

TimeStamped<SerialNumbered<Basic> > mixin1, mixin2;

Unfortunately, Java generics don't permit this. Erasure forgets the base-class type, so a
generic class cannot inherit directly from a generic parameter.

### ‚òò17.14.3. Mixing with interfaces
A commonly suggested solution is to use interfaces to produce the effect of mixins, like this:

```java
//: generics/Mixins.java
import java.util.*;

interface TimeStamped { long getStamp(); }

class TimeStampedImp implements TimeStamped {
    private final long timeStamp;
    public TimeStampedImp() {
        timeStamp = new Date().getTime();
    }
    public long getStamp() { return timeStamp; }
}

interface SerialNumbered { long getSerialNumber(); }

class SerialNumberedImp implements SerialNumbered {
    private static long counter = 1;
    private final long serialNumber = counter++;
    public long getSerialNumber() { return serialNumber; }
}

interface Basic {
    public void set(String val);
    public String get();
}

class BasicImp implements Basic {
    private String value;
    public void set(String val) { value = val; }
    public String get() { return value; }
}

class Mixin extends BasicImp
implements TimeStamped, SerialNumbered {
    private TimeStamped timeStamp = new TimeStampedImp();
    private SerialNumbered serialNumber =
        new SerialNumberedImp();
    public long getStamp() { return timeStamp.getStamp(); }
    public long getSerialNumber() {
        return serialNumber.getSerialNumber();
    }
}

public class Mixins {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Mixin mixin1 = new Mixin(), mixin2 = new Mixin();
        mixin1.set("test string 1");
        mixin2.set("test string 2");
        System.out.println(mixin1.get() + " " +
            mixin1.getStamp() + " " + mixin1.getSerialNumber());
        System.out.println(mixin2.get() + " " +
            mixin2.getStamp() + " " + mixin2.getSerialNumber());
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
test string 1 1132437151359 1
test string 2 1132437151359 2
*///:~
```
The Mixin class is basically using delegation, so each mixed-in type requires a field in
Mixin, and you must write all the necessary methods in Mixin to forward calls to the
appropriate object. This example uses trivial classes, but with a more complex mixin the code
grows rapidly. ‚Å¥

‚Å¥ Note that some programming environments, such as Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea, will automatically 
generate delegation code.

Exercise 37: (2) Add a new mixin class Colored to Mixins.java, mix it into Mixin,
and show that it works.

### ‚òò17.14.4. Using the Decorator pattern
When you look at the way that it is used, the concept of a mixin seems closely related to the
Decorator design pattern. ‚Åµ Decorators are often used when, in order to satisfy every possible
combination, simple subclassing produces so many classes that it becomes impractical.

‚Åµ Patterns are the subject of Thinking in Patterns (with Java), which you can find at www.MindView.net. 
See also Design Patterns, by Erich Gamma et al. (Addison-Wesley, 1995)-

The Decorator pattern uses layered objects to dynamically and transparently add
responsibilities to individual objects. Decorator specifies that all objects that wrap around
your initial object have the same basic interface. Something is decoratable, and you layer on
functionality by wrapping other classes around the decoratable. This makes the use of the
decorators transparentthere are a set of common messages you can send to an object whether
it has been decorated or not. A decorating class can also add methods, but as you shall see,
this is limited.

Decorators are implemented using composition and formal structures (the
decoratable/decorator hierarchy), whereas mixins are inheritance-based. So you could think
of parameterized-type-based mixins as a generic decorator mechanism that does not require
the inheritance structure of the Decorator design pattern.

The previous example can be recast using Decorator:

```java
//: generics/decorator/Decoration.java
package generics.decorator;
import java.util.*;

class Basic {
    private String value;
    public void set(String val) { value = val; }
    public String get() { return value; }
}

class Decorator extends Basic {
    protected Basic basic;
    public Decorator(Basic basic) { this.basic = basic; }
    public void set(String val) { basic.set(val); }
    public String get() { return basic.get(); }
}

class TimeStamped extends Decorator {
    private final long timeStamp;
    public TimeStamped(Basic basic) {
        super(basic);
        timeStamp = new Date().getTime();
    }
    public long getStamp() { return timeStamp; }
}

class SerialNumbered extends Decorator {
    private static long counter = 1;
    private final long serialNumber = counter++;
    public SerialNumbered(Basic basic) { super(basic); }
    public long getSerialNumber() { return serialNumber; }
}

public class Decoration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimeStamped t = new TimeStamped(new Basic());
        TimeStamped t2 = new TimeStamped(
            new SerialNumbered(new Basic()));
        //! t2.getSerialNumber(); // Not available
        SerialNumbered s = new SerialNumbered(new Basic());
        SerialNumbered s2 = new SerialNumbered(
            new TimeStamped(new Basic()));
        //! s2.getStamp(); // Not available
    }
} ///:~
```
The class resulting from a mixin contains all the methods of interest, but the type of the
object that results from using decorators is the last type that it was decorated with. That is,
although it's possible to add more than one layer, the final layer is the actual type, so only the
final layer's methods are visible, whereas the type of the mixin is all the types that have been
mixed together. So a significant drawback to Decorator is that it only effectively works with
one layer of decoration (the final one), and the mixin approach is arguably more natural.
Thus, Decorator is only a limited solution to the problem addressed by mixins.

Exercise 38: (4) Create a simple Decorator system by starting with basic coffee, then
providing decorators of steamed milk, foam, chocolate, caramel and whipped cream.

### ‚òò17.14.5. Mixins with dynamic proxies
It's possible to use a dynamic proxy to create a mechanism that more closely models mixins
than does the Decorator (see the Type Information chapter for an explanation of how Java's
dynamic proxies work). With a dynamic proxy, the dynamic type of the resulting class is the
combined types that have been mixed in.

Because of the constraints of dynamic proxies, each class that is mixed in must be the
implementation of an interface:

```java
//: generics/DynamicProxyMixin.java
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Tuple.*;

class MixinProxy implements InvocationHandler {
    Map < String, Object > delegatesByMethod;
    public MixinProxy(TwoTuple < Object, Class < ? >> ...pairs) {
        delegatesByMethod = new HashMap < String, Object > ();
        for (TwoTuple < Object, Class < ? >> pair : pairs) {
            for (Method method: pair.second.getMethods()) {
                String methodName = method.getName();
                // The first interface in the map
                // implements the method.
                if (!delegatesByMethod.containsKey(methodName))
                    delegatesByMethod.put(methodName, pair.first);
            }
        }
    }
    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method,
        Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        String methodName = method.getName();
        Object delegate = delegatesByMethod.get(methodName);
        return method.invoke(delegate, args);
    }
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static Object newInstance(TwoTuple...pairs) {
        Class[] interfaces = new Class[pairs.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < pairs.length; i++) {
            interfaces[i] = (Class) pairs[i].second;
        }
        ClassLoader cl =
            pairs[0].first.getClass().getClassLoader();
        return Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            cl, interfaces, new MixinProxy(pairs));
    }
}

public class DynamicProxyMixin {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object mixin = MixinProxy.newInstance(
            tuple(new BasicImp(), Basic.class),
            tuple(new TimeStampedImp(), TimeStamped.class),
            tuple(new SerialNumberedImp(), SerialNumbered.class));
        Basic b = (Basic) mixin;
        TimeStamped t = (TimeStamped) mixin;
        SerialNumbered s = (SerialNumbered) mixin;
        b.set("Hello");
        System.out.println(b.get());
        System.out.println(t.getStamp());
        System.out.println(s.getSerialNumber());
    }
} /* Output: (Sample)
Hello

*///:~
```

Because only the dynamic type, and not the static type, includes all the mixed-in types, this is
still not quite as nice as the C++ approach, because you're forced to downcast to the
appropriate type before you can call methods for it. However, it is significantly closer to a
true mixin.

There has been a fair amount of work done towards the support of mixins for Java, including
the creation of at least one language add-on, the Jam language, specifically for supporting
mixins.

Exercise 39: (1) Add a new mixin class Colored to DynamicProxyMixin.java, mix it
into mixin, and show that it works.

## üçÄ17.15. Latent typing
The beginning of this chapter introduced the idea of writing code that can be applied as
generally as possible. To do this, we need ways to loosen the constraints on the types that our
code works with, without losing the benefits of static type checking. We are then able to write
code that can be used in more situations without change‚Äîthat is, more "generic" code.

Java generics appear to take a further step in this direction. When you are writing or using
generics that simply hold objects, the code works with any type (except for primitives,
although as you've seen, autoboxing smoothes this over). Or, put another way, "holder"
generics are able to say, "I don't care what type you are." Code that doesn't care what type it
works with can indeed be applied everywhere, and is thus quite "generic."

As you've also seen, a problem arises when you want to perform manipulations on generic
types (other than calling Object methods), because erasure requires that you specify the
bounds of the generic types that may be used, in order to safely call specific methods for the
generic objects in your code. This is a significant limitation to the concept of "generic"
because you must constrain your generic types so that they inherit from particular classes or
implement particular interfaces. In some cases you might end up using an ordinary class or
interface instead, because a bounded generic might be no different from specifying a class or
interface.

One solution that some programming languages provide is called latent typing or structural
typing. A more whimsical term is duck typing, as in, "If it walks like a duck and talks like a
duck, you might as well treat it like a duck." Duck typing has become a fairly popular term,
possibly because it doesn't carry the historical baggage that other terms do.

Generic code typically only calls a few methods on a generic type, and a language with latent
typing loosens the constraint (and produces more generic code) by only requiring that a
subset of methods be implemented, not a particular class or interface. Because of this, latent
typing allows you to cut across class hierarchies, calling methods that are not part of a
common interface. So a piece of code might say, in effect, "I don't care what type you are as
long as you can speak( ) and sit( )." By not requiring a specific type, your code can be more
generic.

Latent typing is a code organization and reuse mechanism. With it you can write a piece of
code that can be reused more easily than without it. Code organization and reuse are the
foundational levers of all computer programming: Write it once, use it more than once, and
keep the code in one place. Because I am not required to name an exact interface that my
code operates upon, with latent typing I can write less code and apply it more easily in more
places.

Two examples of languages that support latent typing are Python (freely downloadable from
www.Python.org) and C++. ‚Å∂ Python is a dynamically typed language (virtually all the type
checking happens at run time) and C++ is a statically typed language (the type checking
happens at compile time), so latent typing does not require either static or dynamic type
checking.

‚Å∂ The Ruby and Smalltalk languages also support latent typing.

If we take the above description and express it in Python, it looks like this:

```py
#: generics/DogsAndRobots.py

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print "Arf!"
    def sit(self):
        print "Sitting"
    def reproduce(self):
        pass

class Robot:
    def speak(self):
        print "Click!"
    def sit(self):
        print "Clank!"
    def oilChange(self) :
        pass

def perform(anything):
    anything.speak()
    anything.sit()

a = Dog()
b = Robot()
perform(a)
perform(b)
#:~
```
Python uses indentation to determine scope (so no curly braces are needed), and a colon to
begin a new scope. A '#' indicates a comment to the end of the line, like '//' in Java. The
methods of a class explicitly specify the equivalent of the this reference as the first argument,
called self by convention. Constructor calls do not require any sort of "new" keyword. And
Python allows regular (non-member) functions, as evidenced by perform( ).

In perform(anything), notice that there is no type for anything, and anything is just an
identifier. It must be able to perform the operations that perform( ) asks of it, so an
interface is implied. But you never have to explicitly write out that interface‚Äîit's latent.
perform( ) doesn't care about the type of its argument, so I can pass any object to it as long
as it supports the speak( ) and sit( ) methods. If you pass an object to perform( ) that
does not support these operations, you'll get a runtime exception.

We can produce the same effect in C++:

```cpp
//: generics/DogsAndRobots.cpp

class Dog {
    public:
        void speak() {}
    void sit() {}
    void reproduce() {}
};

class Robot {
    public:
        void speak() {}
    void sit() {}
    void oilChange() {};

    template < class T > void perform(T anything) {
        anything.speak();
        anything.sit();
    }

    int main() {
        Dog d;
        Robot r;
        perform(d);
        perform(r);
    } ///:~
```
In both Python and C++, Dog and Robot have nothing in common, other than that they
happen to have two methods with identical signatures. From a type standpoint, they are
completely distinct types. However, perform( ) doesn't care about the specific type of its
argument, and latent typing allows it to accept both types of object.

C++ ensures that it can actually send those messages. The compiler gives you an error
message if you try to pass the wrong type (these error messages have historically been
terrible and verbose, and are the primary reason that C++ templates have a poor reputation).
Although they do it at different times‚Äî C++ at compile time, and Python at run time‚Äîboth
languages ensure that types cannot be misused and are thus considered to be strongly
typed. ‚Å∑ Latent typing does not compromise strong typing.

Because generics were added to Java late in the game, there was no chance that any kind of
latent typing could be implemented, so Java has no support for this feature. As a result, it
initially seems that Java's generic mechanism is "less generic" than a language that supports
latent typing. ‚Å∏ For instance, if we try to implement the above example in Java, we are forced
to use a class or an interface and specify it in a bounds expression:

‚Å∑ Because you can use casts, which effectively disable the type system, some people argue that 
C++ is weakly typed, but that's extreme. It's probably safer to say that C++ is "strongly typed
with a trap door."

‚Å∏ The implementation of Java's generics using erasure is sometimes referred to as secondclass generic types.


```java
//: generics/Performs.java

public interface Performs {
    void speak();
    void sit();
} ///:~


//: generics/DogsAndRobots.java
// No latent typing in Java
import typeinfo.pets.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class PerformingDog extends Dog implements Performs {
    public void speak() { print("Woof!"); }
    public void sit() { print("Sitting"); }
    public void reproduce() {}
}

class Robot implements Performs {
    public void speak() { print("Click!"); }
    public void sit() { print("Clank!"); }
    public void oilChange() {}
}

class Communicate {
    public static < T extends Performs >
        void perform(T performer) {
            performer.speak();
            performer.sit();
        }
}

public class DogsAndRobots {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PerformingDog d = new PerformingDog();
        Robot r = new Robot();
        Communicate.perform(d);
        Communicate.perform(r);
    }
} /* Output:
Woof!
Sitting
Click!
Clank!
*///:~
```
However, note that perform( ) does not need to use generics in order to work. It can simply
be specified to accept a Performs object:

```java
//: generics/SimpleDogsAndRobots.java
// Removing the generic; code still works.

class CommunicateSimply {
    static void perform(Performs performer) {
        performer.speak();
        performer.sit();
    }
}

public class SimpleDogsAndRobots {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommunicateSimply.perform(new PerformingDog());
        CommunicateSimply.perform(new Robot());
    }
} /* Output:
Woof!
Sitting
Click!
Clank!
*///:~
```
In this case, generics were simply not necessary, since the classes were already forced to
implement the Performs interface.

## üçÄ17.16. Compensating for the lack of latent typing
Although Java does not support latent typing, it turns out that this does not mean that your
bounded generic code cannot be applied across different type hierarchies. That is, it is still
possible to create truly generic code, but it takes some extra effort.

### ‚òò17.16.1. Reflection
One approach you can use is reflection. Here's a perform( ) method that uses latent typing:

```java
//: generics/LatentReflection.java
// Using Reflection to produce latent typing.
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

// Does not implement Performs:
class Mime {
    public void walkAgainstTheWind() {}
    public void sit() { print("Pretending to sit"); }
    public void pushInvisibleWalls() {}
    public String toString() { return "Mime"; }
}

// Does not implement Performs:
class SmartDog {
    public void speak() { print("Woof!"); }
    public void sit() { print("Sitting"); }
    public void reproduce() {}
}

class CommunicateReflectively {
    public static void perform(Object speaker) {
        Class < ? > spkr = speaker.getClass();
        try {
            try {
                Method speak = spkr.getMethod("speak");
                speak.invoke(speaker);
            } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
                print(speaker + " cannot speak");
            }
            try {
                Method sit = spkr.getMethod("sit");
                sit.invoke(speaker);
            } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
                print(speaker + " cannot sit");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(speaker.toString(), e);
        }
    }
}

public class LatentReflection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommunicateReflectively.perform(new SmartDog());
        CommunicateReflectively.perform(new Robot());
        CommunicateReflectively.perform(new Mime());

    }
} /* Output:
Woof!
Sitting
Click!
Clank!
Mime cannot speak
Pretending to sit
*///:~
```
Here, the classes are completely disjoint and have no base classes (other than Object) or
interfaces in common. Through reflection, CommunicateReflectively.perform( ) is able
to dynamically establish whether the desired methods are available and call them. It is even
able to deal with the fact that Mime only has one of the necessary methods, and partially
fulfills its goal.

### ‚òò17.16.2. Applying a method to a sequence
Reflection provides some interesting possibilities, but it relegates all the type checking to run
time, and is thus undesirable in many situations. If you can achieve compile-time type
checking, that's usually more desirable. But is it possible to have compile-time type checking
and latent typing?

Let's look at an example that explores the problem. Suppose you want to create an apply( )
method that will apply any method to every object in a sequence. This is a situation where
interfaces don't seem to fit. You want to apply any method to a collection of objects, and
interfaces constrain you too much to describe "any method." How do you do this in Java?
Initially, we can solve the problem with reflection, which turns out to be fairly elegant
because of Java SE5 varargs:

```java
//: generics/Apply.java
// {main: ApplyTest}
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Apply {
    public static < T, S extends Iterable < ? extends T >>
        void apply(S seq, Method f, Object...args) {
            try {
                for (T t: seq)
                    f.invoke(t, args);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Failures are programmer errors
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
}

class Shape {
    public void rotate() { print(this + " rotate"); }
    public void resize(int newSize) {
        print(this + " resize " + newSize);
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {}

class FilledList < T > extends ArrayList < T > {
    public FilledList(Class < ? extends T > type, int size) {
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)

In Apply, we get lucky because there happens to be an Iterable interface built into Java
which is used by the Java containers library. Because of this, the apply( ) method can accept
anything that implements the Iterable interface, which includes all the Collection classes
such as List. But it can also accept anything else, as long as you make it Iterable‚Äîfor
example, the SimpleQueue class defined here and used above in main( ):

```java
//: generics/SimpleQueue.java
// A different kind of container that is Iterable
import java.util.*;

public class SimpleQueue<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    private LinkedList<T> storage = new LinkedList<T>();
    public void add(T t) { storage.offer(t); }
    public T get() { return storage.poll(); }
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return storage.iterator();
    }
} ///:~
```
In Apply.java, exceptions are converted to RuntimeExceptions because there's not much
of a way to recover from exceptions‚Äîthey really do represent programmer errors in this case.

Note that I had to put in bounds and wildcards in order for Apply and FilledList to be used
in all desired situations. You can experiment by taking these out, and you'll discover that
some applications of Apply and FilledList will not work.

FilledList presents a bit of a quandary. In order for a type to be used, it must have a default
(no-arg) constructor. Java has no way to assert such a thing at compile time, so it becomes a
runtime issue. A common suggestion to ensure compile-time checking is to define a factory
interface that has a method that generates objects; then FilledList would accept that
interface rather than the "raw factory" of the type token. The problem with this is that all the
classes you use in FilledList must then implement your factory interface. Alas, most classes
are created without knowledge of your interface, and therefore do not implement it. Later, I'll
show one solution using adapters.

But the approach shown, of using a type token, is perhaps a reasonable tradeoff (at least as a
first-cut solution). With this approach, using something like FilledList is just easy enough
that it may be used rather than ignored. Of course, because errors are reported at run time,
you need confidence that these errors will appear early in the development process.
Note that the type token technique is recommended in the Java literature, such as Gilad
Bracha's paper Generics in the Java Programming Language, ‚Åπ where he notes, "It's an
idiom that's used extensively in the new APIs for manipulating annotations, for example."
However, I've discovered some inconsistency in people's comfort level with this technique;
some people strongly prefer the factory approach, which was presented earlier in this
chapter.

‚Åπ See citation at the end of this chapter.


Also, as elegant as the Java solution turns out to be, we must observe that the use of
reflection (although it has been improved significantly in recent versions of Java) may be
slower than a non-reflection implementation, since so much is happening at run time. This
should not stop you from using the solution, at least as a first cut (lest you fall sway to
premature optimization), but it's certainly a distinction between the two approaches.

### ‚òò17.16.3. interface
The above example benefited because the Iterable interface was already built in, and was
exactly what we needed. But what about the general case, when there isn't an interface
already in place that just happens to fit your needs?

For example, let's generalize the idea in FilledList and create a parameterized fill( )
method that will take a sequence and fill it using a Generator. When we try to write this in
Java, we run into a problem, because there is no convenient "Addable" interface as there
was an Iterable interface in the previous example. So instead of saying, "anything that you
can call add( ) for," you must say, "subtype of Collection." The resulting code is not
particularly generic, since it must be constrained to work with Collection implementations.
If I try to use a class that doesn't implement Collection, my generic code won't work. Here's
what it looks like:

```java
//: generics/Fill.java
// Generalizing the FilledList idea
// {main: FillTest}
import java.util.*;

// Doesn't work with "anything that has an add()." There is
// no "Addable" interface so we are narrowed to using a
// Collection. We cannot generalize using generics in
// this case.
public class Fill {
    public static < T > void fill(Collection < T > collection,
        Class < ? extends T > classToken, int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            // Assumes default constructor:
            try {
                collection.add(classToken.newInstance());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
    }
}

    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;

        List < Contract > contracts = new ArrayList < Contract > ();
        Fill.fill(contracts, Contract.class, 3);
        Fill.fill(contracts, TitleTransfer.class, 2);
        for (Contract c: contracts)
            System.out.println(c);
        SimpleQueue < Contract > contractQueue =
            new SimpleQueue < Contract > ();
        // Won't work. fill() is not generic enough:

This is where a parameterized type mechanism with latent typing is valuable, because you are
not at the mercy of the past design decisions of any particular library creator, so you do not
have to rewrite your code every time you encounter a new library that didn't take your
situation into account (thus the code is truly "generic"). In the above case, because the Java
designers (understandably) did not see the need for an "Addable" interface, we are
constrained within the Collection hierarchy, and SimpleQueue, even though it has an
add( ) method, will not work. Because it is thus constrained to working with Collection, the
code is not particularly "generic." With latent typing, this would not be the case.

### ‚òò17.16.4. Simulating latent typing with adapters
So Java generics don't have latent typing, and we need something like latent typing in order
to write code that can be applied across class boundaries (that is, "generic" code). Is there
some way to get around this limitation?

What would latent typing accomplish here? It means that you could write code saying, "I
don't care what type I'm using here as long as it has these methods." In effect, latent typing
creates an implicit interface containing the desired methods. So it follows that if we write the
necessary interface by hand (since Java doesn't do it for us), that should solve the problem.

Writing code to produce an interface that we want from an interface that we have is an example of
the Adapter design pattern. We can use adapters to adapt existing classes to produce the desired
interface, with a relatively small amount of code. The solution, which uses the previously defined
Coffee hierarchy, demonstrates different ways of writing adapters:

```java
//: generics/Fill2.java
// Using adapters to simulate latent typing.
// {main: Fill2Test}
import generics.coffee.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

interface Addable<T> { void add(T t); }

public class Fill2 {
    // Classtoken version:
    public static < T > void fill(Addable < T > addable,
        Class < ? extends T > classToken, int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            try {
                addable.add(classToken.newInstance());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
    }
    // Generator version:
    public static < T > void fill(Addable < T > addable,
        Generator < T > generator, int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            addable.add(generator.next());
    }
}

// To adapt a base type, you must use composition.
// Make any Collection Addable using composition:
class AddableCollectionAdapter < T > implements Addable < T > {
    private Collection < T > c;
    public AddableCollectionAdapter(Collection < T > c) {
        this.c = c;
    }
    public void add(T item) { c.add(item); }
}

// A Helper to capture the type automatically:
class Adapter {
    public static < T >
    Addable < T > collectionAdapter(Collection < T > c) {
        return new AddableCollectionAdapter < T > (c);
    }
}

// To adapt a specific type, you can use inheritance.
// Make a SimpleQueue Addable using inheritance:
class AddableSimpleQueue < T >
extends SimpleQueue < T > implements Addable < T > {
    public void add(T item) { super.add(item); }
}

class Fill2Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Adapt a Collection:
        List < Coffee > carrier = new ArrayList < Coffee > ();
        Fill2.fill(
            new AddableCollectionAdapter < Coffee > (carrier),
            Coffee.class, 3);
        // Helper method captures the type:
        Fill2.fill(Adapter.collectionAdapter(carrier),
            Latte.class, 2);
        for (Coffee c: carrier)
            print(c);
        print("----------------------");
        // Use an adapted class:
        AddableSimpleQueue < Coffee > coffeeQueue =
            new AddableSimpleQueue < Coffee > ();
        Fill2.fill(coffeeQueue, Mocha.class, 4);
        Fill2.fill(coffeeQueue, Latte.class, 1);
        for (Coffee c: coffeeQueue)
            print(c);
    }

```
Fill2 doesn't require a Collection as Fill did. Instead, it only needs something that
implements Addable, and Addable has been written just for Fill‚Äîit is a manifestation of
the latent type that I wanted the compiler to make for me.

In this version, I've also added an overloaded fill( ) that takes a Generator rather than a
type token. The Generator is type-safe at compile time: The compiler ensures that you pass
it a proper Generator, so no exceptions can be thrown.

The first adapter, AddableCollectionAdapter, works with the base type Collection,
which means that any implementation of Collection can be used. This version simply stores
the Collection reference and uses it to implement add( ).

If you have a specific type rather than the base class of a hierarchy, you can write somewhat
less code when creating your adapter by using inheritance, as you can see in
AddableSimpleQueue.

In Fill2Test.main( ), you can see the various types of adapters at work. First, a Collection
type is adapted with AddableCollectionAdapter. A second version of this uses a generic
helper method, and you can see how the generic method captures the type so it doesn't have
to be explicitly written‚Äî this is a convenient trick that produces more elegant code.

Next, the pre-adapted AddableSimpleQueue is used. Note that in both cases the adapters
allow the classes that previously didn't implement Addable to be used with Fill2.fill( ).
Using adapters like this would seem to compensate for the lack of latent typing, and thus
allow you to write genuinely generic code. However, it's an extra step and something that
must be understood both by the library creator and the library consumer, and the concept
may not be grasped as readily by less experienced programmers. By removing the extra step,
latent typing makes generic code easier to apply, and this is its value.

Exercise 41: (1) Modify Fill2.java to use the classes in typeinfo.pets instead of the
Coffee classes.


## üçÄ17.17. Using function objects as strategies
This final example will create truly generic code using the adapter approach described in the
previous section. The example began as an attempt to create a sum over a sequence of
elements (of any type that can be summed), but evolved into performing general operations
using afunctional style of programming.

If you just look at the process of trying to add objects, you can see that this is a case where we
have common operations across classes, but the operations are not represented in any base
class that we can specify‚Äîsometimes you can even use a'+' operator, and other times there
may be some kind of "add" method. This is generally the situation that you encounter when
trying to write generic code, because you want the code to apply across multiple classes‚Äî
especially, as in this case, multiple classes that already exist and that we have no ability to
"fix." Even if you were to narrow this case to subclasses of Number, that superclass doesn't
include anything about "addability."

The solution is to use the Strategy design pattern, which produces more elegant code
because it completely isolates "the thing that changes" inside of a function object. ¬π‚Å∞ A
function object is an object that in some way behaves like a function‚Äîtypically, there's one
method of interest (in languages that support operator overloading, you can make the call to
this method look like an ordinary method call). The value of function objects is that, unlike
an ordinary method, they can be passed around, and they can also have state that persists
across calls. Of course, you can accomplish something like this with any method in a class,
but (as with any design pattern) the function object is primarily distinguished by its intent.
Here the intent is to create something that behaves like a single method that you can pass
around; thus it is closely coupled with‚Äîand sometimes indistinguishable from‚Äîthe Strategy
design pattern.

¬π‚Å∞ You will sometimes see these called functors. I will use the term function object rather 
than functor, as the term "functor" has a specific and different meaning in mathematics.


As I've found with a number of design patterns, the lines get kind of blurry here: We are 
creating function objects which perform adaptation, and they are being passed into methods to 
be used as strategies.

Taking this approach, I added the various kinds of generic methods that I had originally set out to
create, and more. Here is the result:

I begin by defining interfaces for different types of function objects. These were created on
demand, as I developed the different methods and discovered the need for each. The
Combiner class was suggested by an anonymous contributor to one of the articles posted on
my Web site. The Combiner abstracts away the specific detail of trying to add two objects,
and just says that they are being combined somehow. As a result, you can see that
IntegerAdder and IntegerSubtracter can be types of Combiner.

A UnaryFunction takes a single argument and produces a result; the argument and result
need not be of the same type. A Collector is used as a "collecting parameter," and you can
extract the result when you're finished. A UnaryPredicate produces a boolean result.
There are other types of function objects that can be defined, but these are enough to make
the point.

The Functional class contains a number of generic methods that apply function objects to
sequences. reduce( ) applies the function in a Combiner to each element of a sequence in
order to produce a single result.

forEach( ) takes a Collector and applies its function to each element, ignoring the result of
each function call. This can be called just for the side effect (which wouldn't be a "functional"
style of programming but can still be useful), or the Collector can maintain internal state to
become a collecting parameter, as is the case in this example.

transform( ) produces a list by calling a UnaryFunction on each object in the sequence
and capturing the result.

Finally, filter( ) applies a UnaryPredicate to each object in a sequence and stores the ones
that produce true in a List, which it returns.

You can define additional generic functions. The C++ STL, for example, has lots of them. The
problem has also been solved in some open-source libraries, such as the JGA (Generic
Algorithms for Java).

In C++, latent typing takes care of matching up operations when you call functions, but in
Java we need to write the function objects to adapt the generic methods to our particular
needs. So the next part of the class shows various different implementations of the function
objects. Note, for example, that IntegerAdder and BigDecimalAdder solve the same
problemadding two objects‚Äîby calling the appropriate operations for their particular type.
So that's the Adapter pattern and Strategy pattern combined.

In main( ), you can see that in each method call, a sequence is passed along with the
appropriate function object. Also, a number of the expressions can get fairly complex, such
as:

    forEach(filter(li, new GreaterThan(4)),
    new MultiplyingIntegerCollector()).result()

This produces a list by selecting all elements in li that are greater than 4, and then applies the
MultiplyingIntegerCollector( ) to the resulting list and extracts the result( ). I won't
explain the details of the rest of the code other than to say that you can probably figure it out
by walking through it.

Exercise 42: (5) Create two separate classes, with nothing in common. Each class should
hold a value, and at least have methods that produce that value and perform a modification
upon that value. Modify Functional.java so that it performs functional operations on
collections of your classes (these operations do not have to be arithmetic as they are in
Functional.java).

## üçÄ17.18. Summary: Is casting really so bad?
Having worked to explain C++ templates since their inception, I have probably been putting
forward the following argument longer than most people. Only recently have I stopped to
wonder how often this argument is valid‚Äîhow many times does the problem I'm about to
describe really slip through the cracks?

The argument goes like this. One of the most compelling places to use a generic type
mechanism is with container classes such as the Lists, Sets, Maps, etc. that you saw in
Holding Your Objects and that you shall see more of in the Containers in Depth chapter.
Before Java SE5, when you put an object into a container, it would be upcast to Object, so
you'd lose the type information. When you wanted to pull it back out to do something with it,
you had to cast it back down to the proper type. My example was a List of Cat (a variation of
this using apples and oranges is shown at the beginning of the Holding Your Objects
chapter). Without the Java SE5 generic version of the container, you put Objects in and you
get Objects out, so it's easily possible to put a Dog in a List of Cat.

However, pre-generic Java wouldn't let you misuse the objects that you put into a container.
If you threw a Dog into a container of Cats and then tried to treat everything in the
container as a Cat, you'd get a RuntimeException when you pulled the Dog reference out
of the Cat container and tried to cast it to a Cat. You'd still discover the problem, but you
discovered it at run time rather than compile time.

In previous editions of this book, I go on to say:
This is more than just an annoyance. It's something that can create difficult-to-find bugs.
If one part (or several parts) of a program inserts objects into a container, and you
discover only in a separate part of the program through an exception that a bad object
was placed in the container, then you must find out where the bad insert occurred.

However, upon further examination of the argument, I began to wonder about it. First, how
often does it happen? I don't remember this kind of thing ever happening to me, and when I
asked people at conferences, I didn't hear anyone say that it had happened to them. Another
book used an example of a list called files that contained String objects‚Äîin this example it
seemed perfectly natural to add a File object to files, so a better name for the object might
have been fileNames. No matter how much type checking Java provides, it's still possible to
write obscure programs, and a badly written program that compiles is still a badly written
program. Perhaps most people use well-named containers such as "cats" that provide a
visual warning to the programmer who would try to add a non-Cat. And even if it did happen,
how long would such a thing really stay buried? It would seem that as soon as you started
running tests with real data, you'd see an exception pretty quickly.

One author even asserted that such a bug could "remain buried for years." But I do not recall
any deluge of reports of people having great difficulty finding "dog in cat list" bugs, or even
producing them very often. Whereas you will see in the Concurrency chapter that with
threads, it is very easy and common to have bugs that may appear extremely rarely, and only
give you a vague idea of what's wrong. So is the "dog in cat list" argument really the reason
that this very significant and fairly complex feature has been added to Java?

I believe the intent of the general-purpose language feature called "generics" (not necessarily
Java's particular implementation of it) is expressiveness, not just creating type-safe
containers. Type-safe containers come as a side effect of the ability to create more general-
purpose code.

So even though the "dog in cat list" argument is often used to justify generics, it is
questionable. And as I asserted at the beginning of the chapter, I do not believe that this is
what the concept of generics is really about. Instead, generics are as their name implies‚Äîa
way to write more "generic" code that is less constrained by the types it can work with, so a
single piece of code can be applied to more types. As you have seen in this chapter, it is fairly
easy to write truly generic "holder" classes (which the Java containers are), but to write
generic code that manipulates its generic types requires extra effort, on the part of both the
class creator and the class consumer, who must understand the concept and implementation
of the Adapter design pattern. That extra effort reduces the ease of use of the feature, and
may thus make it less applicable in places where it might otherwise have added value.

Also note that because generics were back-engineered into Java instead of being designed
into the language from the start, some of the containers cannot be made as robust as they
should be. For example, look at Map, in particular the methods containsKey(Object key)
and get(Object key). If these classes had been designed with pre-existing generics, these
methods would have used parameterized types instead of Object, thus affording the
compile-time checking that generics are supposed to provide. In C++ maps, for example, the
key type is always checked at compile time.

One thing is very clear: Introducing any kind of generic mechanism in a later version of a
language, after that language has come into general use, is a very, very messy proposition,
and one that cannot be accomplished without pain. In C++, templates were introduced in the
initial ISO version of the language (although even that caused some pain because there was
an earlier nontemplate version in use before the first Standard C++ appeared), so in effect
templates were always a part of the language. In Java, generics were not introduced until
almost 10 years after the language was first released, so the issues of migrating to generics
are quite considerable, and have made a significant impact on the design of generics. The
result is that you, the programmer, will suffer because of the lack of vision exhibited by the
Java designers when they created version l.o. When Java was first being created, the
designers, of course, knew about C++ templates, and they even considered including them in
the language, but for one reason or another decided to leave them out (indications are that
they were in a hurry). As a result, both the language and the programmers that use it will
suffer. Only time will show the ultimate impact that Java's approach to generics will have on
the language.

Some languages, notably Nice (see http://nice.sourceforge.net; this language generates Java
bytecodes and works with existing Java libraries) and NextGen (see
http://japan.cs.rice.edu/nextgen) have incorporated cleaner and less impactful approaches
to parameterized types. It's not impossible to imagine such a language becoming a successor
to Java, because it takes exactly the approach that C++ did with C: Use what's there and
improve upon it.

# üìú 18. Arrays
At the end of the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, you learned how to
define and initialize an array.

The simple view of arrays is that you create and populate them, you select elements from
them using int indexes, and they don't change their size. Most of the time that's all 
you need to know, but sometimes you need to perform more sophisticated operations on arrays, 
and you may also need to evaluate the use of an array vs. a more flexible container. This 
chapter will show you how to think about arrays in more depth.

## üçÄ18.1. Why arrays are special

There are a number of other ways to hold objects, so what makes an array special?
There are three issues that distinguish arrays from other types of containers: efficiency, type,
and the ability to hold primitives. The array is Java's most efficient way to store and
randomly access a sequence of object references. The array is a simple linear sequence, which
makes element access fast. The cost of this speed is that the size of an array object is fixed
and cannot be changed for the lifetime of that array. You might suggest an ArrayList (from
Holding Your Objects), which will automatically allocate more space, creating a new one and
moving all the references from the old one to the new one. Although you should generally
prefer an ArrayList to an array, this flexibility has overhead, so an ArrayList is measurably
less efficient than an array.

Both arrays and containers guarantee that you can't abuse them. Whether you're using an
array or a container, you'll get a RuntimeException if you exceed the bounds, indicating a
programmer error.

Before generics, the other container classes dealt with objects as if they had no specific type.
That is, they treated them as type Object, the root class of all classes in Java. Arrays are
superior to pre-generic containers because you create an array to hold a specific type. This
means that you get compile-time type checking to prevent you from inserting the wrong type
or mistaking the type that you're extracting. Of course, Java will prevent you from sending an
inappropriate message to an object at either compile time or run time. So it's not riskier one
way or the other; it's just nicer if the compiler points it out to you, and there's less likelihood
that the end user will get surprised by an exception.

An array can hold primitives, whereas a pre-generic container could not. With generics,
however, containers can specify and check the type of objects they hold, and with autoboxing
containers can act as if they are able to hold primitives, since the conversion is automatic.
Here's an example that compares arrays with generic containers:

```java
//: arrays/ContainerComparison.java
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

class BerylliumSphere {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public String toString() { return "Sphere " + id; }
}

public class ContainerComparison {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BerylliumSphere[] spheres = new BerylliumSphere[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            spheres[i] = new BerylliumSphere();
        print(Arrays.toString(spheres));
        print(spheres[4]);

        List < BerylliumSphere > sphereList =
            new ArrayList < BerylliumSphere > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            sphereList.add(new BerylliumSphere());
        print(sphereList);
        print(sphereList.get(4));

        int[] integers = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        print(Arrays.toString(integers));
        print(integers[4]);

        List < Integer > intList = new ArrayList < Integer > (
            Arrays.asList(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
        intList.add(97);
        print(intList);
        print(intList.get(4));
    }
} /* Output:
[Sphere 0, Sphere 1, Sphere 2, Sphere 3, Sphere 4, null, null, null,
null, null]
Sphere 4
[Sphere 5, Sphere 6, Sphere 7, Sphere 8, Sphere 9]
Sphere 9
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
4
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 97]

```
Both ways of holding objects are type-checked, and the only apparent difference is that arrays
use [ ] for accessing elements, and a List uses methods such as add( ) and get( ). The
similarity between arrays and the ArrayList is intentional, so that it's conceptually easy to
switch between the two. But as you saw in the Holding Your Objects chapter, containers have
significantly more functionality than arrays.

With the advent of autoboxing, containers are nearly as easy to use for primitives as arrays.
The only remaining advantage to arrays is efficiency. However, when you're solving a more
general problem, arrays can be too restrictive, and in those cases you use a container class.
Arrays are first-class objects

Regardless of what type of array you're working with, the array identifier is actually a
reference to a true object that's created on the heap. This is the object that holds the
references to the other objects, and it can be created either implicitly, as part of the array
initialization syntax, or explicitly with a new expression. Part of the array object (in fact, the
only field or method you can access) is the read-only length member that tells you how
many elements can be stored in that array object. The '[ ]' syntax is the only other access that
you have to the array object.

The following example summarizes the various ways that an array can be initialized, and how
the array references can be assigned to different array objects. It also shows that arrays of

objects and arrays of primitives are almost identical in their use. The only difference is that
arrays of objects hold references, but arrays of primitives hold the primitive values directly.

```java
//: arrays/ArrayOptions.java
// Initialization & re-assignment of arrays.
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ArrayOptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Arrays of objects:
        BerylliumSphere[] a; // Local uninitialized variable
        BerylliumSphere[] b = new BerylliumSphere[5];
        // The references inside the array are
        // automatically initialized to null:
        print("b: " + Arrays.toString(b));
        BerylliumSphere[] c = new BerylliumSphere[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++)
            if (c[i] == null) // Can test for null reference
                c[i] = new BerylliumSphere();
        // Aggregate initialization:
        BerylliumSphere[] d = {
            new BerylliumSphere(),
            new BerylliumSphere(),
            new BerylliumSphere()
        };
        // Dynamic aggregate initialization:
        a = new BerylliumSphere[] {
            new BerylliumSphere(), new BerylliumSphere(),
        };
        // (Trailing comma is optional in both cases)
        print("a.length = " + a.length);
        print("b.length = " + b.length);
        print("c.length = " + c.length);
        print("d.length = " + d.length);
        a = d;
        print("a.length = " + a.length);

        // Arrays of primitives:
        int[] e; // Null reference
        int[] f = new int[5];
        // The primitives inside the array are
        // automatically initialized to zero:
        print("f: " + Arrays.toString(f));
        int[] g = new int[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < g.length; i++)
            g[i] = i * i;
        int[] h = { 11, 47, 93 };
        // Compile error: variable e not initialized:
        //!print("e.length = " + e.length);
        print("f.length = " + f.length);
        print("g.length = " + g.length);
        print("h.length = " + h.length);
        e = h;
        print("e.length = " + e.length);
        e = new int[] { 1, 2 };
        print("e.length = " + e.length);
    }
} /* Output:
b: [null, null, null, null, null]

f.length = 5
g.length = 4
h.length = 3

*///:~
```
The array a is an uninitialized local variable, and the compiler prevents you from doing
anything with this reference until you've properly initialized it. The array b is initialized to
point to an array of BerylliumSphere references, but no actual BerylliumSphere objects
are ever placed in that array. However, you can still ask what the size of the array is, since b
is pointing to a legitimate object. This brings up a slight drawback: You can't find out how
many elements are actually in the array, since length tells you only how many elements can
be placed in the array; that is, the size of the array object, not the number of elements it
actually holds. However, when an array object is created, its references are automatically
initialized to null, so you can see whether a particular array slot has an object in it by
checking to see whether it's null. Similarly, an array of primitives is automatically initialized
to zero for numeric types, (char)o for char, and false for boolean.

Array c shows the creation of the array object followed by the assignment of
BerylliumSphere objects to all the slots in the array. Array d shows the "aggregate
initialization" syntax that causes the array object to be created (implicitly with new on the
heap, just like for array c) and initialized with BerylliumSphere objects, all in one
statement.

The next array initialization can be thought of as a "dynamic aggregate initialization." The
aggregate initialization used by d must be used at the point of d's definition, but with the
second syntax you can create and initialize an array object anywhere. For example, suppose
hide( ) is a method that takes an array of BerylliumSphere objects. You could call it by
saying:

    hide(d);

but you can also dynamically create the array you want to pass as the argument:

    hide(new BerylliumSphere[]{ new BerylliumSphere(),
    new BerylliumSphere() });

In many situations this syntax provides a more convenient way to write code.

    The expression:
    a = d;

shows how you can take a reference that's attached to one array object and assign it to
another array object, just as you can do with any other type of object reference. Now both a
and d are pointing to the same array object on the heap.

The second part of ArrayOptions.java shows that primitive arrays work just like object
arrays except that primitive arrays hold the primitive values directly.

Exercise 1: (2) Create a method that takes an array of BerylliumSphere as an
argument. Call the method, creating the argument dynamically. Demonstrate that ordinary
aggregate array initialization doesn't work in this case. Discover the only situations where
ordinary aggregate array initialization works, and where dynamic aggregate initialization is
redundant.

## üçÄ18.2. Returning an array
Suppose you're writing a method and you don't want to return just one thing, but a whole
bunch of things. Languages like C and C++ make this difficult because you can't just return
an array, only a pointer to an array. This introduces problems because it becomes messy to
control the lifetime of the array, which leads to memory leaks.

In Java, you just return the array. You never worry about responsibility for that array‚Äîit will
be around as long as you need it, and the garbage collector will clean it up when you're done.
As an example, consider returning an array of String:

```java
//: arrays/IceCream.java
// Returning arrays from methods.
import java.util.*;

public class IceCream {
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    static final String[] FLAVORS = {
        "Chocolate",
        "Strawberry",
        "Vanilla Fudge Swirl",
        "Mint Chip",
        "Mocha Almond Fudge",
        "Rum Raisin",
        "Praline Cream",
        "Mud Pie"
    };
    public static String[] flavorSet(int n) {
        if (n > FLAVORS.length)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Set too big");
        String[] results = new String[n];
        boolean[] picked = new boolean[FLAVORS.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int t;
            do
                t = rand.nextInt(FLAVORS.length);
            while (picked[t]);
            results[i] = FLAVORS[t];
            picked[t] = true;
        }
        return results;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(flavorSet(3)));
    }
} /* Output:
[Rum Raisin, Mint Chip, Mocha Almond Fudge]
[Chocolate, Strawberry, Mocha Almond Fudge]
[Strawberry, Mint Chip, Mocha Almond Fudge]
[Rum Raisin, Vanilla Fudge Swirl, Mud Pie]
[Vanilla Fudge Swirl, Chocolate, Mocha Almond Fudge]
[Praline Cream, Strawberry, Mocha Almond Fudge]
[Mocha Almond Fudge, Strawberry, Mint Chip]
*///:~
```
The method flavorSet( ) creates an array of String called results. The size of this array is
n, determined by the argument that you pass into the method. Then it proceeds to choose
flavors randomly from the array FLAVORS and place them into results, which it returns.
Returning an array is just like returning any other object‚Äîit's a reference. It's not important
that the array was created within flavorSet( ), or that the array was created anyplace else, for
that matter. The garbage collector takes care of cleaning up the array when you're done with
it, and the array will persist for as long as you need it.

As an aside, notice that when flavorSet( ) chooses flavors randomly, it ensures that a
particular choice hasn't already been selected. This is performed in a do loop that keeps
making random choices until it finds one not already in the picked array. (Of course, a
String comparison also could have been performed to see if the random choice was already
in the results array.) If it's successful, it adds the entry and finds the next one (i gets
incremented).

You can see from the output that flavorSet( ) chooses the flavors in a random order each
time.

Exercise 2: (1) Write a method that takes an int argument and returns an array of that
size, filled with BerylliumSphere objects.

## üçÄ18.3. Multidimensional arrays
You can easily create multidimensional arrays. For a multidimensional array of primitives,
you delimit each vector in the array by using curly braces:

```java
//: arrays/MultidimensionalPrimitiveArray.java
// Creating multidimensional arrays.
import java.util.*;

public class MultidimensionalPrimitiveArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] a = { { 1, 2, 3, },
            { 4, 5, 6, },
        };
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
    }
} /* Output:
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
*///:~
```
Each nested set of curly braces moves you into the next level of the array.
This example uses the Java SE5 Arrays.deepToString( ) method, which turns
multidimensional arrays into Strings, as you can see from the output.

You can also allocate an array using new. Here's a three-dimensional array allocated in a
new expression:

```java
//: arrays/ThreeDWithNew.java
import java.util.*;

public class ThreeDWithNew {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 3-D array with fixed length:
        int[][][] a = new int[2][2][4];
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
    }
} /* Output:
[[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]]
*///:~
```

You can see that primitive array values are automatically initialized if you don't give them an
explicit initialization value. Arrays of objects are initialized to null.

Each vector in the arrays that make up the matrix can be of any length (this is called a ragged
array):

```java
//: arrays/RaggedArray.java
import java.util.*;

public class RaggedArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random(47);
        // 3-D array with varied-length vectors:
        int[][][] a = new int[rand.nextInt(7)][][];
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            a[i] = new int[rand.nextInt(5)][];
            for (int j = 0; j < a[i].length; j++)
                a[i][j] = new int[rand.nextInt(5)];
        }
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
    }
} /* Output:
[[], [[0], [0], [0, 0, 0, 0]], [[], [0, 0], [0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [0],
[0, 0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0], []], [[0], [], [0]]]
*///:~
```
The first new creates an array with a random-length first element and the rest
undetermined. The second new inside the for loop fills out the elements but leaves the third
index undetermined until you hit the third new.

You can deal with arrays of non-primitive objects in a similar fashion. Here, you can see how
to collect many new expressions with curly braces:

```java
//: arrays/MultidimensionalObjectArrays.java
import java.util.*;

public class MultidimensionalObjectArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BerylliumSphere[][] spheres = { { new BerylliumSphere(), new BerylliumSphere() },
            {
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere()
            },
            {
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere(),
                new BerylliumSphere()
            },
        };
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(spheres));
    }
} /* Output:
[[Sphere 0, Sphere 1], [Sphere 2, Sphere 3, Sphere 4, Sphere 5], [Sphere
6, Sphere 7, Sphere 8, Sphere 9, Sphere 10, Sphere 11, Sphere 12, Sphere
13]]
*///:~
```
You can see that spheres is another ragged array, where the length of each list of objects is
different.

Autoboxing also works with array initializers:

```java
//: arrays/AutoboxingArrays.java
import java.util.*;

public class AutoboxingArrays {

        };
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
    }
} /* Output:

Here's how an array of non-primitive objects can be built up piece-by-piece:

```java
//: arrays/AssemblingMultidimensionalArrays.java
// Creating multidimensional arrays.
import java.util.*;

public class AssemblingMultidimensionalArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[][] a;
        a = new Integer[3][];
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            a[i] = new Integer[3];
            for (int j = 0; j < a[i].length; j++)
                a[i][j] = i * j; // Autoboxing
        }
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(a));
    }
} /* Output:
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 4]]
*///:~
```
The i * j is only there to put an interesting value into the Integer.
The Arrays.deepToString( ) method works with both primitive arrays and object arrays:

```java
//: arrays/MultiDimWrapperArray.java
// Multidimensional arrays of "wrapper" objects.
import java.util.*;

public class MultiDimWrapperArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[][] a1 = { // Autoboxing
            { 1, 2, 3, },
            { 4, 5, 6, },
        };
        Double[][][] a2 = { // Autoboxing
            { { 1.1, 2.2 }, { 3.3, 4.4 } },
            { { 5.5, 6.6 }, { 7.7, 8.8 } },
            { { 9.9, 1.2 }, { 2.3, 3.4 } },
        };

        String[][] a3 = { { "The", "Quick", "Sly", "Fox" },
            { "Jumped", "Over" },
            { "The", "Lazy", "Brown", "Dog", "and", "friend" },
        };
        System.out.println("a1: " + Arrays.deepToString(a1));
        System.out.println("a2: " + Arrays.deepToString(a2));
        System.out.println("a3: " + Arrays.deepToString(a3));
    }
} /* Output:
a1: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
a2: [[[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]], [[5.5, 6.6], [7.7, 8.8]], [[9.9, 1.2],
[2.3, 3.4]]]
a3: [[The, Quick, Sly, Fox], [Jumped, Over], [The, Lazy, Brown, Dog,
and, friend]]

```
Again, in the Integer and Double arrays, Java SE5 autoboxing creates the wrapper objects
for you.

Exercise 3: (4) Write a method that creates and initializes a twodimensional array of
double. The size of the array is determined by the arguments of the method, and the
initialization values are a range determined by beginning and ending values that are also
arguments of the method. Create a second method that will print the array generated by the
first method. In main( ) test the methods by creating and printing several different sizes of
arrays.

Exercise 4: (2) Repeat the previous exercise for a three-dimensional array.

Exercise 5: (1) Demonstrate that multidimensional arrays of nonprimitive types are
automatically initialized to null.

Exercise 6: (1) Write a method that takes two int arguments, indicating the two sizes of
a 2-D array. The method should create and fill a 2-D array of BerylliumSphere according
to the size arguments.

Exercise 7: (1) Repeat the previous exercise for a 3-D array.

## üçÄ18.4. Arrays and generics
In general, arrays and generics do not mix well. You cannot instantiate arrays of
parameterized types:

Peel<Banana>[] peels = new Peel<Banana> [10]; // Illegal

Erasure removes the parameter type information, and arrays must know the exact type that
they hold, in order to enforce type safety.

However, you can parameterize the type of the array itself:

```java
//: arrays/ParameterizedArrayType.java

class ClassParameter < T > {
    public T[] f(T[] arg) { return arg; }
    Arrays 543
}

class MethodParameter {
    public static < T > T[] f(T[] arg) { return arg; }
}

public class ParameterizedArrayType {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] ints = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        Double[] doubles = { 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5 };
        Integer[] ints2 =
            new ClassParameter < Integer > ().f(ints);
        Double[] doubles2 =
            new ClassParameter < Double > ().f(doubles);
        ints2 = MethodParameter.f(ints);
        doubles2 = MethodParameter.f(doubles);
    }
} ///:~
```
Note the convenience of using a parameterized method instead of a parameterized class: You
don't have to instantiate a class with a parameter for each different type you need to apply it
to, and you can make it static. Of course, you can't always choose to use a parameterized
method instead of a parameterized class, but it can be preferable.

As it turns out, it's not precisely correct to say that you cannot create arrays of generic types.
True, the compiler won't let you instantiate an array of a generic type. However, it will let
you create a reference to such an array. For example:

List<String>[] ls;

This passes through the compiler without complaint. And although you cannot create an
actual array object that holds generics, you can create an array of the non-generified type and
cast it:

```java
//: arrays/ArrayOfGenerics.java
// It is possible to create arrays of generics.
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayOfGenerics {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List < String > [] ls;
        List[] la = new List[10];
        ls = (List < String > []) la; // "Unchecked" warning
        ls[0] = new ArrayList < String > ();
        // Compile-time checking produces an error:
        //! ls[1] = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        // The problem: List<String> is a subtype of Object
        Object[] objects = ls; // So assignment is OK
        // Compiles and runs without complaint:
        objects[1] = new ArrayList < Integer > ();

        // However, if your needs are straightforward it is
        // possible to create an array of generics, albeit
        // with an "unchecked" warning:
        List < BerylliumSphere > [] spheres =
            (List < BerylliumSphere > []) new List[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < spheres.length; i++)
            spheres[i] = new ArrayList < BerylliumSphere > ();
    }

} ///:~
```
Once you have a reference to a List<String>[], you can see that you get some compile-time
checking. The problem is that arrays are covariant, so a List<String>[] is also an Object[],
and you can use this to assign an ArrayList<Integer> into your array, with no error at
either compile time or run time.

If you know you're not going to upcast and your needs are relatively simple, however, it is
possible to create an array of generics, which will provide basic compile-time type checking.
However, a generic container will virtually always be a better choice than an array of
generics.

In general you'll find that generics are effective at the boundaries of a class or method. In the
interiors, erasure usually makes generics unusable. So you cannot, for example, create an
array of a generic type:

```java
//: arrays/ArrayOfGenericType.java
// Arrays of generic types won't compile.

public class ArrayOfGenericType<T> {
    T[] array; // OK
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public ArrayOfGenericType(int size) {
        //! array = new T[size]; // Illegal
        array = (T[])new Object[size]; // "unchecked" Warning
    }
    // Illegal:
    //! public <U> U[] makeArray() { return new U[10]; }
} ///:~
```
Erasure gets in the way again‚Äîthis example attempts to create arrays of types that have been
erased, and are thus unknown types. Notice that you can create an array of Object, and cast
it, but without the @SuppressWarnings annotation you get an "unchecked" warning at
compile time because the array doesn't really hold or dynamically check for type T. That is, if
I create a String[], Java will enforce at both compile time and run time that I can only place
String objects in that array. However, if I create an Object[], I can put anything into that
array except primitive types.

Exercise 8: (1) Demonstrate the assertions in the previous paragraph.

Exercise 9: (3) Create the classes necessary for the Peel<Banana> example and show
that the compiler doesn't accept it. Fix the problem using an ArrayList.

Exercise 10: (2) Modify ArrayOfGenerics .Java to use containers instead of arrays.
Show that you can eliminate the compile-time warnings.

## üçÄ18.5. Creating test data
When experimenting with arrays, and with programs in general, it's helpful to be able to
easily generate arrays filled with test data. The tools in this section will fill an array with
values or objects.

### ‚òò18.5.1. Arrays.fill()
The Java standard library Arrays class has a rather trivial fill( ) method: It only duplicates
a single value into each location, or in the case of objects, copies the same reference into each
location. Here's an example:

```java
//: arrays/FillingArrays.java
// Using Arrays.fill()
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class FillingArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int size = 6;
        boolean[] a1 = new boolean[size];
        byte[] a2 = new byte[size];
        char[] a3 = new char[size];
        short[] a4 = new short[size];
        int[] a5 = new int[size];
        long[] a6 = new long[size];
        float[] a7 = new float[size];
        double[] a8 = new double[size];
        String[] a9 = new String[size];
        Arrays.fill(a1, true);
        print("a1 = " + Arrays.toString(a1));
        Arrays.fill(a2, (byte) 11);
        print("a2 = " + Arrays.toString(a2));
        Arrays.fill(a3, 'x');
        print("a3 = " + Arrays.toString(a3));
        Arrays.fill(a4, (short) 17);
        print("a4 = " + Arrays.toString(a4));
        Arrays.fill(a5, 19);
        print("a5 = " + Arrays.toString(a5));
        Arrays.fill(a6, 23);
        print("a6 = " + Arrays.toString(a6));
        Arrays.fill(a7, 29);
        print("a7 = " + Arrays.toString(a7));
        Arrays.fill(a8, 47);
        print("a8 = " + Arrays.toString(a8));
        Arrays.fill(a9, "Hello");
        print("a9 = " + Arrays.toString(a9));
        // Manipulating ranges:
        Arrays.fill(a9, 3, 5, "World");
        print("a9 = " + Arrays.toString(a9));
    }
} /* Output:
a1 = [true, true, true, true, true, true]
a2 = [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11]
a3 = [x, x, x, x, x, x]
a4 = [17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17]
a5 = [19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19]
a6 = [23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23]
a7 = [29.0, 29.0, 29.0, 29.0, 29.0, 29.0]

a8 = [47.0, 47.0, 47.0, 47.0, 47.0, 47.0]
a9 = [Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello]
a9 = [Hello, Hello, Hello, World, World, Hello]
*///:~
```
You can either fill the entire array or, as the last two statements show, fill a range of
elements. But since you can only call Arrays.fill( ) with a single data value, the results are
not especially useful.

### ‚òò18.5.2. Data Generators
To create more interesting arrays of data, but in a flexible fashion, we'll use the Generator
concept that was introduced in the Generics chapter. If a tool uses a Generator, you can
produce any kind of data via your choice of Generator (this is an example of the Strategy
design pattern‚Äîeach different Generator represents a different strategy ¬π ).
This section will supply some Generators, and as you've seen before, you can easily define
your own.

¬π Although this is a place where things are a bit fuzzy. You could also make an argument that 
a Generator represents the Command pattern. However, I think that the task is to fill an array, 
and the Generator fulfills part of that task, so it's more strategy-like than command-like.


First, here's a basic set of counting generators for all primitive wrapper types, and for
Strings. The generator classes are nested within the CountingGenerator class so that
they may use the same name as the object types they are generating; for example, a generator
that creates Integer objects would be created with the expression new
CountingGenerator.Integer( ):

```java
//: net/mindview/util/CountingGenerator.java
// Simple generator implementations.
package net.mindview.util;

public class CountingGenerator {
    public static class
    Boolean implements Generator < java.lang.Boolean > {
        private boolean value = false;
        public java.lang.Boolean next() {
            value = !value; // Just flips back and forth
            return value;
        }
    }
    public static class
    Byte implements Generator < java.lang.Byte > {
        private byte value = 0;
        public java.lang.Byte next() { return value++; }
    }
    static char[] chars = ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" +
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ").toCharArray();
    public static class
    Character implements Generator < java.lang.Character > {
        int index = -1;
        public java.lang.Character next() {
            index = (index + 1) % chars.length;
            return chars[index];
        }
    }
    public static class
    String implements Generator < java.lang.String > {
        private int length = 7;
        Generator < java.lang.Character > cg = new Character();
        public String() {}
        public String(int length) { this.length = length; }
        public java.lang.String next() {
            char[] buf = new char[length];
            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
                buf[i] = cg.next();
            return new java.lang.String(buf);
        }
    }
    public static class
    Short implements Generator < java.lang.Short > {
        private short value = 0;
        public java.lang.Short next() { return value++; }
    }
    public static class
    Integer implements Generator < java.lang.Integer > {
        private int value = 0;
        public java.lang.Integer next() { return value++; }
    }
    public static class
    Long implements Generator < java.lang.Long > {
        private long value = 0;
        public java.lang.Long next() { return value++; }
    }
    public static class
    Float implements Generator < java.lang.Float > {
        private float value = 0;
        public java.lang.Float next() {
            float result = value;
            value += 1.0;
            return result;
        }
    }
    public static class
    Double implements Generator < java.lang.Double > {
        private double value = 0.0;
        public java.lang.Double next() {
            double result = value;
            value += 1.0;
            return result;
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
Each class implements some meaning of "counting." In the case of
CountingGenerator.Character, this is just the upper and lowercase letters repeated over
and over. The CountingGenerator.String class uses CountingGenerator.Character
to fill an array of characters, which is then turned into a String. The size of the array is
determined by the constructor argument. Notice that CountingGenerator.String uses a
basic Generator <java.lang.Character > instead of a specific reference to
CountingGenerator.Character. Later, this generator can be replaced to produce
RandomGenerator.String in RandomGenerator.java.

Here's a test tool that uses reflection with the nested Generator idiom, so that it can be
used to test any set of Generators that follow this form:

```java
//: arrays/GeneratorsTest.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class GeneratorsTest {
    public static int size = 10;

    public static void test(Class < ? > surroundingClass) {
        for (Class < ? > type : surroundingClass.getClasses()) {
            System.out.print(type.getSimpleName() + ": ");
            try {
                Generator < ? > g = (Generator < ? > ) type.newInstance();
                for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
                    System.out.printf(g.next() + " ");
                System.out.println();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(CountingGenerator.class);
    }
} /* Output:
Double: 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0

```
This assumes that the class under test contains a set of nested Generator objects, each of
which has a default constructor (one without arguments). The reflection method
getClasses( ) produces all the nested classes. The test( ) method then creates an instance
of each of these generators, and prints the result produced by calling next( ) ten times.
Here is a set of Generators that use the random number generator. Because the Random
constructor is initialized with a constant value, the output is repeatable each time you run a
program using one of these Generators:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/RandomGenerator.java
// Generators that produce random values.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.*;

public class RandomGenerator {
    private static Random r = new Random(47);
    public static class
    Boolean implements Generator < java.lang.Boolean > {
        public java.lang.Boolean next() {
            return r.nextBoolean();
        }
    }
    public static class
    Byte implements Generator < java.lang.Byte > {
        public java.lang.Byte next() {
            return (byte) r.nextInt();
        }
    }
    public static class
    Character implements Generator < java.lang.Character > {
        public java.lang.Character next() {
            return CountingGenerator.chars[
                r.nextInt(CountingGenerator.chars.length)];

        }
    }
    public static class
    String extends CountingGenerator.String {
        // Plug in the random Character generator:
        { cg = new Character(); } // Instance initializer
        public String() {}
        public String(int length) { super(length); }
    }
    public static class
    Short implements Generator < java.lang.Short > {
        public java.lang.Short next() {
            return (short) r.nextInt();
        }
    }
    public static class
    Integer implements Generator < java.lang.Integer > {
        private int mod = 10000;
        public Integer() {}
        public Integer(int modulo) { mod = modulo; }
        public java.lang.Integer next() {
            return r.nextInt(mod);
        }
    }
    public static class
    Long implements Generator < java.lang.Long > {
        private int mod = 10000;
        public Long() {}
        public Long(int modulo) { mod = modulo; }
        public java.lang.Long next() {
            return new java.lang.Long(r.nextInt(mod));
        }
    }
    public static class
    Float implements Generator < java.lang.Float > {
        public java.lang.Float next() {
            // Trim all but the first two decimal places:
            int trimmed = Math.round(r.nextFloat() * 100);
            return ((float) trimmed) / 100;
        }
    }
    public static class
    Double implements Generator < java.lang.Double > {
        public java.lang.Double next() {
            long trimmed = Math.round(r.nextDouble() * 100);
            return ((double) trimmed) / 100;
        }
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see that RandomGenerator.String inherits from CountingGenerator.String
and simply plugs in the new Character generator.

To generate numbers that aren't too large, RandomGenerator.Integer defaults to a
modulus of 10,000, but the overloaded constructor allows you to choose a smaller value. The
same approach is used for RandomGenerator.Long. For the Float and Double
Generators, the values after the decimal point are trimmed.
We can reuse GeneratorsTest to test RandomGenerator:

```java
//: arrays/RandomGeneratorsTest.java
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class RandomGeneratorsTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GeneratorsTest.test(RandomGenerator.class);

### ‚òò18.5.3. Creating arrays from Generators
In order to take a Generator and produce an array, we need two conversion tools. The first
one uses any Generator to produce an array of Object subtypes. To cope with the problem
of primitives, the second tool takes any array of primitive wrapper types and produces the
associated array of primitives.

The first tool has two options, represented by an overloaded static method, array( ). The
first version of the method takes an existing array and fills it using a Generator, and the
second version takes a Class object, a Generator, and the desired number of elements, and
creates a new array, again filling it using the Generator. Notice that this tool only produces
arrays of Object subtypes and cannot create primitive arrays:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/Generated.java
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.*;

public class Generated {
    // Fill an existing array:
    public static <T> T[] array(T[] a, Generator<T> gen) {
        return new CollectionData<T>(gen, a.length).toArray(a);
    }
    // Create a new array:
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static <T> T[] array(Class<T> type,
    Generator<T> gen, int size) {
        T[] a =
            (T[])java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(type, size);
        return new CollectionData<T>(gen, size).toArray(a);
    }
} ///:~
```
The CollectionData class will be defined in the Containers in Depth chapter. It creates a
Collection object filled with elements produced by the Generator gen. The number of
elements is determined by the second constructor argument. All Collection subtypes have a
toArray( ) method that will fill the argument array with the elements from the Collection.

The second method uses reflection to dynamically create a new array of the appropriate type
and size. This is then filled using the same technique as the first method.
We can test Generated using one of the CountingGenerator classes defined in the
previous section:

```java
//: arrays/TestGenerated.java
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class TestGenerated {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] a = { 9, 8, 7, 6 };
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
        a = Generated.array(a,new CountingGenerator.Integer());
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
        Integer[] b = Generated.array(Integer.class,
            new CountingGenerator.Integer(), 15);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(b));
    }
} /* Output:
[9, 8, 7, 6]
[0, 1, 2, 3]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
*///:~
```
Even though the array a is initialized, those values are overwritten by passing it through
Generated.array( ), which replaces the values (but leaves the original array in place). The
initialization of b shows how you can create a filled array from scratch.

Generics don't work with primitives, and we want to use the generators to fill primitive
arrays. To solve the problem, we create a converter that takes any array of wrapper objects
and converts it to an array of the associated primitive types. Without this tool, we would have
to create special case generators for all the primitives.

```java
//: net/mindview/util/ConvertTo.java
package net.mindview.util;

public class ConvertTo {
    public static boolean[] primitive(Boolean[] in ) {
        boolean[] result = new boolean[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i]; // Autounboxing
        return result;
    }
    public static char[] primitive(Character[] in ) {
        char[] result = new char[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
    public static byte[] primitive(Byte[] in ) {
        byte[] result = new byte[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
    public static short[] primitive(Short[] in ) {
        short[] result = new short[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];

        return result;
    }
    public static int[] primitive(Integer[] in ) {
        int[] result = new int[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
    public static long[] primitive(Long[] in ) {
        long[] result = new long[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
    public static float[] primitive(Float[] in ) {
        float[] result = new float[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
    public static double[] primitive(Double[] in ) {
        double[] result = new double[ in .length];
        for (int i = 0; i < in .length; i++)
            result[i] = in [i];
        return result;
    }
} ///:~
```
Each version of primitive( ) creates an appropriate primitive array of the correct length,
then copies the elements from the in array of wrapper types. Notice that autounboxing takes
place in the expression:

result[i] = in [1];

Here's an example that shows how you can use ConvertTo with both versions of
Generated.array( ):

```java
//: arrays/PrimitiveConversionDemonstration.java
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class PrimitiveConversionDemonstration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer[] a = Generated.array(Integer.class,
            new CountingGenerator.Integer(), 15);
        int[] b = ConvertTo.primitive(a);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(b));
        boolean[] c = ConvertTo.primitive(
            Generated.array(Boolean.class,
                new CountingGenerator.Boolean(), 7));
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(c));
    }
} /* Output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
[true, false, true, false, true, false, true]
*///:~
```
Finally, here's a program that tests the array generation tools using RandomGenerator
classes:

```java
//: arrays/TestArrayGeneration.java

// Test the tools that use generators to fill arrays.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class TestArrayGeneration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int size = 6;
        boolean[] a1 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Boolean.class, new RandomGenerator.Boolean(), size));
        print("a1 = " + Arrays.toString(a1));
        byte[] a2 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Byte.class, new RandomGenerator.Byte(), size));
        print("a2 = " + Arrays.toString(a2));
        char[] a3 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Character.class,
            new RandomGenerator.Character(), size));
        print("a3 = " + Arrays.toString(a3));
        short[] a4 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Short.class, new RandomGenerator.Short(), size));
        print("a4 = " + Arrays.toString(a4));
        int[] a5 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Integer.class, new RandomGenerator.Integer(), size));
        print("a5 = " + Arrays.toString(a5));
        long[] a6 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Long.class, new RandomGenerator.Long(), size));
        print("a6 = " + Arrays.toString(a6));
        float[] a7 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Float.class, new RandomGenerator.Float(), size));
        print("a7 = " + Arrays.toString(a7));
        double[] a8 = ConvertTo.primitive(Generated.array(
            Double.class, new RandomGenerator.Double(), size));
        print("a8 = " + Arrays.toString(a8));
    }
} /* Output:
a1 = [true, false, true, false, false, true]
a2 = [104, -79, -76, 126, 33, -64]
a3 = [Z, n, T, c, Q, r]

## üçÄ18.6. Arrays utilities
In java.util, you'll find the Arrays class, which holds a set of static utility methods for
arrays. There are six basic methods: equals( ), to compare two arrays for equality (and a
deepEquals( ) for multidimensional arrays); fill( ), which you've seen earlier in this
chapter; sort( ), to sort an array; binarySearch( ), to find an element in a sorted array;
toString( ), to produce a String representation for an array; and hashCode( ), to produce
the hash value of an array (you'll learn what this means in the Containers in Depth chapter).
All of these methods are overloaded for all the primitive types and Objects. In addition,
Arrays.asList( ) takes any sequence or array and turns it into a List container‚Äîthis
method was covered in the Holding Your Objects chapter.

Before discussing the Arrays methods, there's one other useful method that isn't part of
Arrays.

### ‚òò18.6.1. Copying an array
The Java standard library provides a static method, System.arraycopy( ), which can copy
arrays far more quickly than if you use a for loop to perform the copy by hand.
System.arraycopyC ) is overloaded to handle all types. Here's an example that
manipulates arrays of int:

```java
//: arrays/CopyingArrays.java
// Using System.arraycopy()
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class CopyingArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] i = new int[7];
        int[] j = new int[10];
        Arrays.fill(i, 47);
        Arrays.fill(j, 99);
        print("i = " + Arrays.toString(i));
        print("j = " + Arrays.toString(j));
        System.arraycopy(i, 0, j, 0, i.length);
        print("j = " + Arrays.toString(j));
        int[] k = new int[5];
        Arrays.fill(k, 103);
        System.arraycopy(i, 0, k, 0, k.length);
        print("k = " + Arrays.toString(k));
        Arrays.fill(k, 103);
        System.arraycopy(k, 0, i, 0, k.length);
        print("i = " + Arrays.toString(i));
        // Objects:
        Integer[] u = new Integer[10];
        Integer[] v = new Integer[5];
        Arrays.fill(u, new Integer(47));
        Arrays.fill(v, new Integer(99));
        print("u = " + Arrays.toString(u));
        print("v = " + Arrays.toString(v));
        System.arraycopy(v, 0, u, u.length / 2, v.length);
        print("u = " + Arrays.toString(u));
    }
} /* Output:
i = [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47]
j = [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99]
j = [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 99, 99, 99]
k = [47, 47, 47, 47, 47]
i = [103, 103, 103, 103, 103, 47, 47]
u = [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47]
v = [99, 99, 99, 99, 99]
u = [47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99]
*///:~
```
The arguments to arraycopy( ) are the source array, the offset into the source array from
whence to start copying, the destination array, the offset into the destination array where the
copying begins, and the number of elements to copy. Naturally, any violation of the array
boundaries will cause an exception.

The example shows that both primitive arrays and object arrays can be copied. However, if
you copy arrays of objects, then only the references get copied‚Äîthere's no duplication of the
objects themselves. This is called a shallow copy (see the online supplements for this book
for more details).

System.arraycopy( ) will not perform autoboxing or autounboxing‚Äîthe two arrays must
be of exactly the same type.

Exercise 18: (3) Create and fill an array of BerylliumSphere. Copy this array to a new
array and show that it's a shallow copy.

### ‚òò18.6.2. Comparing arrays
Arrays provides the equals( ) method to compare entire arrays for equality, which is
overloaded for all the primitives and for Object. To be equal, the arrays must have the same
number of elements, and each element must be equivalent to each corresponding element in
the other array, using the equals( ) for each element. (For primitives, that primitive's
wrapper class equals( ) is used; for example, Integer.equals( ) for int.) For example:

```java
//: arrays/ComparingArrays.java
// Using Arrays.equals()
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ComparingArrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] a1 = new int[10];
        int[] a2 = new int[10];
        Arrays.fill(a1, 47);
        Arrays.fill(a2, 47);
        print(Arrays.equals(a1, a2));
        a2[3] = 11;
        print(Arrays.equals(a1, a2));
        String[] s1 = new String[4];
        Arrays.fill(s1, "Hi");
        String[] s2 = {
            new String("Hi"),
            new String("Hi"),
            new String("Hi"),
            new String("Hi")
        };
        print(Arrays.equals(s1, s2));
    }
} /* Output:
true
false
true
*///:~
```
Originally, a1 and a2 are exactly equal, so the output is "true," but then one of the elements
is changed, which makes the result "false." In the last case, all the elements of s1 point to the
same object, but s2 has five unique objects. However, array equality is based on contents (via
Object.equals( )), so the result is "true."

Exercise 19: (2) Create a class with an int field that's initialized from a constructor
argument. Create two arrays of these objects, using identical initialization values for each
array, and show that Arrays.equals( ) says that they are unequal. Add an equals( )
method to your class to fix the problem.

Exercise 20: (4) Demonstrate deepEquals( ) for multidimensional arrays.

### ‚òò18.6.3. Array element comparisons
Sorting must perform comparisons based on the actual type of the object. Of course, one
approach is to write a different sorting method for every different type, but such code is not
reusable for new types.

A primary goal of programming design is to "separate things that change from things that
stay the same," and here, the code that stays the same is the general sort algorithm, but the
thing that changes from one use to the next is the way objects are compared. So instead of
placing the comparison code into many different sort routines, the Strategy design pattern is
used. ¬≤ With a Strategy, the part of the code that varies is encapsulated inside a separate class
(the Strategy object). You hand a Strategy object to the code that's always the same, which
uses the Strategy to fulfill its algorithm. That way, you can make different objects to express
different ways of comparison and feed them to the same sorting code.

¬≤ Design Patterns, Erich Gamma et al. (Addison-Wesley, 1995). See Thinking in Patterns 
(with Java) at www.MindView.net.


Java has two ways to provide comparison functionality. The first is with the "natural"
comparison method that is imparted to a class by implementing the
java.lang.Comparable interface. This is a very simple interface with a single method,
compareTo( ). This method takes another object of the same type as an argument and
produces a negative value if the current object is less than the argument, zero if the argument is
equal, and a positive value if the current object is greater than the argument.
Here's a class that implements Comparable and demonstrates the comparability by using the
Java standard library method Arrays.sort( ):

```java
//: arrays/CompType.java
// Implementing Comparable in a class.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class CompType implements Comparable < CompType > {
    int i;
    int j;
    private static int count = 1;
    public CompType(int n1, int n2) {
        i = n1;
        j = n2;
    }
    public String toString() {
        String result = "[i = " + i + ", j = " + j + "]";
        if (count++ % 3 == 0)
            result += "\n";
        return result;
    }
    public int compareTo(CompType rv) {
        return (i < rv.i ? -1 : (i == rv.i ? 0 : 1));
    }
    private static Random r = new Random(47);
    public static Generator < CompType > generator() {
        return new Generator < CompType > () {
            public CompType next() {
                return new CompType(r.nextInt(100), r.nextInt(100));
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompType[] a =
            Generated.array(new CompType[12], generator());
        print("before sorting:");
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
        Arrays.sort(a);
        print("after sorting:");
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
    }
} /* Output:

, [i = 68, j = 0], [i = 22, j = 7], [i = 88, j = 28]

, [i = 58, j = 55], [i = 61, j = 29], [i = 68, j = 0]
, [i = 88, j = 28], [i = 93, j = 61], [i = 98, j = 61]
]
*///:~
```
When you define the comparison method, you are responsible for deciding what it means to
compare one of your objects to another. Here, only the i values are used in the comparison,
and the j values are ignored.

The generator( ) method produces an object that implements the Generator interface by
creating an anonymous inner class. This builds CompType objects by initializing them with
random values. In main( ), the generator is used to fill an array of CompType, which is
then sorted. If Comparable hadn't been implemented, then you'd get a
ClassCastException at run time when you tried to call sort( ). This is because sort( )
casts its argument to Comparable.

Now suppose someone hands you a class that doesn't implement Comparable, or hands
you this class that does implement Comparable, but you decide you don't like the way it
works and would rather have a different comparison method for the type. To solve the
problem, you create a separate class that implements an interface called Comparator
(briefly introduced in the Holding Your Objects chapter). This is an example of the Strategy
design pattern. It has two methods, compare( ) and equals( ). However, you don't have to
implement equals( ) except for special performance needs, because anytime you create a
class, it is implicitly inherited from Object, which has an equals( ). So you can just use the
default Object equals( ) and satisfy the contract imposed by the interface.

The Collections class (which we'll look at more in the next chapter) contains a method
reverseOrder( ) that produces a Comparator to reverse the natural sorting order. This can be
applied to CompType:

```java
//: arrays/Reverse.java
// The Collections.reverseOrder() Comparator
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class Reverse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompType[] a = Generated.array(
            new CompType[12], CompType.generator());
        print("before sorting:");
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
        Arrays.sort(a, Collections.reverseOrder());
        print("after sorting:");
        print(Arrays.toString(a));
    }
} /* Output:
before sorting:
[[i = 58, j = 55], [i = 93, j = 61], [i = 61, j = 29]
, [i = 68, j = 0], [i = 22, j = 7], [i = 88, j = 28]
, [i = 51, j = 89], [i = 9, j = 78], [i = 98, j = 61]
, [i = 20, j = 58], [i = 16, j = 40], [i = 11, j = 22]
]
after sorting:
[[i = 98, j = 61], [i = 93, j = 61], [i = 88, j = 28]
, [i = 68, j = 0], [i = 61, j = 29], [i = 58, j = 55]
, [i = 51, j = 89], [i = 22, j = 7], [i = 20, j = 58]
, [i = 16, j = 40], [i = 11, j = 22], [i = 9, j = 78]
]
*///:~
```
You can also write your own Comparator. This one compares CompType objects based on
their j values rather than their i values:

```java
//: arrays/ComparatorTest.java
// Implementing a Comparator for a class.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

Exercise 21: (3) Try to sort an array of the objects in Exercise 18. Implement
Comparable to fix the problem. Now create a Comparator to sort the objects into reverse
order.

### ‚òò18.6.4. Sorting an array
With the built-in sorting methods, you can sort any array of primitives, or any array of
objects that either implements Comparable or has an associated Comparator. ¬≥ Here's an
example that generates random String objects and sorts them:

¬≥ Surprisingly, there was no support in Java 1.0 or 1.1 for sorting Strings.


```java
//: arrays/StringSorting.java
// Sorting an array of Strings.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class StringSorting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] sa = Generated.array(new String[20],
            new RandomGenerator.String(5));
        print("Before sort: " + Arrays.toString(sa));
        Arrays.sort(sa);
        print("After sort: " + Arrays.toString(sa));
        Arrays.sort(sa, Collections.reverseOrder());
        print("Reverse sort: " + Arrays.toString(sa));
        Arrays.sort(sa, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
        print("Case-insensitive sort: " + Arrays.toString(sa));
    }
} /* Output:
Before sort: [YNzbr, nyGcF, OWZnT, cQrGs, eGZMm, JMRoE, suEcU, OneOE,
dLsmw, HLGEa, hKcxr, EqUCB, bkIna, Mesbt, WHkjU, rUkZP, gwsqP, zDyCy,

After sort: [EqUCB, HLGEa, HxxHv, JMRoE, Mesbt, OWZnT, OneOE, RFJQA,

HLGEa, HxxHv, JMRoE, Mesbt, nyGcF, OneOE, OWZnT, RFJQA, rUkZP, suEcU,
WHkjU, YNzbr, zDyCy]
*///:~
```
One thing you'll notice about the output in the String sorting algorithm is that it's
lexicographic, so it puts all the words starting with uppercase letters first, followed by all the
words starting with lowercase letters. (Telephone books are typically sorted this way.) If you
want to group the words together regardless of case, use
String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER as shown in the last call to sort( ) in the above
example.

The sorting algorithm that's used in the Java standard library is designed to be optimal for
the particular type you're sorting‚Äîa Quicksort for primitives, and a stable merge sort for
objects. You don't need to worry about performance unless your profiler points you to the
sorting process as a bottleneck.

### ‚òò18.6.5. Searching a sorted array
Once an array is sorted, you can perform a fast search for a particular item by using
Arrays.binarySearch( ). However, if you try to use binarySearchC ) on an unsorted
array the results will be unpredictable. The following example uses a
RandomGenerator.Integer to fill an array, and then uses the same generator to produce
search values:

```java
//: arrays/ArraySearching.java
// Using Arrays.binarySearch().
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;

public class ArraySearching {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Generator < Integer > gen =
            new RandomGenerator.Integer(1000);
        int[] a = ConvertTo.primitive(
            Generated.array(new Integer[25], gen));
        Arrays.sort(a);
        print("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(a));
        while (true) {
            int r = gen.next();
            int location = Arrays.binarySearch(a, r);
            if (location >= 0) {
                print("Location of " + r + " is " + location +
                    ", a[" + location + "] = " + a[location]);
                break; // Out of while loop
            }
        }
    }
} /* Output:
Sorted array: [128, 140, 200, 207, 258, 258, 278, 288, 322, 429, 511,
520, 522, 551, 555, 589, 693, 704, 809, 861, 861, 868, 916, 961, 998]

Location of 322 is 8, a[8] = 322
*///:~
```
In the while loop, random values are generated as search items until one of them is found.
Arrays.binarySearch( ) produces a value greater than or equal to zero if the search item is
found. Otherwise, it produces a negative value representing the place that the element should
be inserted if you are maintaining the sorted array by hand. The value produced is

    -(insertion point) - 1

The insertion point is the index of the first element greater than the key, or a.size( ), if all
elements in the array are less than the specified key.

If an array contains duplicate elements, there is no guarantee which of those duplicates will
be found. The search algorithm is not designed to support duplicate elements, but rather to
tolerate them. If you need a sorted list of non-duplicated elements, use a TreeSet (to
maintain sorted order) or LinkedHashSet (to maintain insertion order). These classes take
care of all the details for you automatically. Only in cases of performance bottlenecks should
you replace one of these classes with a hand-maintained array.

If you sort an object array using a Comparator (primitive arrays do not allow sorting with a
Comparator), you must include that same Comparator when you perform a
binarySearch( ) (using the overloaded version of binarySearch( )). For example, the
StringSorting.java program can be modified to perform a search:

```java
//: arrays/AlphabeticSearch.java
// Searching with a Comparator.
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class AlphabeticSearch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] sa = Generated.array(new String[30],
            new RandomGenerator.String(5));
        Arrays.sort(sa, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sa));
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(sa, sa[10],
            String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
        System.out.println("Index: " + index + "\n" + sa[index]);
    }
} /* Output:
[bkIna, cQrGs, cXZJo, dLsmw, eGZMm, EqUCB, gwsqP, hKcxr, HLGEa, HqXum,
HxxHv, JMRoE, JmzMs, Mesbt, MNvqe, nyGcF, ogoYW, OneOE, OWZnT, RFJQA,
rUkZP, sgqia, slJrL, suEcU, uTpnX, vpfFv, WHkjU, xxEAJ, YNzbr, zDyCy]
Index: 10
HxxHv
*///:~
```
The Comparator must be passed to the overloaded binarySearch( ) as the third argument. In
this example, success is guaranteed because the search item is selected from the array itself.

Exercise 22: (2) Show that the results of performing a binarySearch( ) on an unsorted
array are unpredictable.

Exercise 23: (2) Create an array of Integer, fill it with random int values (using
autoboxing), and sort it into reverse order using a Comparator.


Exercise 24: (3) Show that the class from Exercise 19 can be searched.


## üçÄ18.7. Summary
In this chapter, you've seen that Java provides reasonable support for fixedsized, low-level
arrays. This sort of array emphasizes performance over flexibility, just like the C and C++
array model. In the initial version of Java, fixed-sized, low-level arrays were absolutely
necessary, not only because the Java designers chose to include primitive types (also for
performance), but because the support for containers in that version was very minimal. Thus,
in early versions of Java, it was always reasonable to choose arrays.

In subsequent versions of Java, container support improved significantly, and now
containers tend to outshine arrays in all ways except for performance, and even then, the
performance of containers has been significantly improved. As stated in other places in this
book, performance problems are usually never where you imagine them to be, anyway.

With the addition of autoboxing and generics, holding primitives in containers has become
effortless, which further encourages you to replace low-level arrays with containers. Because
generics produce type-safe containers, arrays no long have an advantage on that front, either.
As noted in this chapter and as you'll see when you try to use them, generics are fairly hostile
towards arrays. Often, even when you can get generics and arrays to work together in some
form (as you'll see in the next chapter), you'll still end up with "unchecked" warnings during
compilation.

On several occasions I have been told directly by Java language designers that I should be
using containers instead of arrays, when we were discussing particular examples (I was using
arrays to demonstrate specific techniques and so I did not have that option).

All of these issues indicate that you should "prefer containers to arrays" when programming
in recent versions of Java. Only when it's proven that performance is an issue (and that
switching to an array will make a difference) should you refactor to arrays.

This is a rather bold statement, but some languages have no fixed-sized, lowlevel arrays at all.
They only have resizable containers with significantly more functionality than C/C++/Java-
style arrays. Python, ‚Å¥ for example, has a list type that uses basic array syntax, but has much
greater functionality‚Äîyou can even inherit from it:

‚Å¥ See www.Python.org.

```py
#: arrays/PythonLists.py

aList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print type(aList) # <type 'list'>
print aList # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print aList[4] # 5 Basic list indexing
aList.append(6) # lists can be resized
aList += [7, 8] # Add a list to a list
print aList # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
aSlice = aList[2:4]
print aSlice # [3, 4]

class MyList(list): # Inherit from list
    # Define a method, 'this' pointer is explicit:
    def getReversed(self):
        reversed = self[:] # Copy list using slices
        reversed.reverse() # Built-in list method
        return reversed
list2 = MyList(aList) # No 'new' needed for object creation
print type(list2) # <class '__main__.MyList'>
print list2.getReversed() # [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#:~
```


Basic Python syntax was introduced in the previous chapter. Here, a list is created by simply
surrounding a comma-separated sequence of objects with square brackets. The result is an
object with a runtime type of list (the output of the print statements is shown as comments
on the same line). The result of printing a list is the same as that of using
Arrays.toString() in Java.

Creating a sub-sequence of a list is accomplished with "slicing," by placing the':' operator
inside the index operation. The list type has many more builtin operations.
MyList is a class definition; the base classes are placed within the parentheses. Inside the
class, def statements produce methods, and the first argument to the method is
automatically the equivalent of this in Java, except that in Python it's explicit and the
identifier self is used by convention (it's not a keyword). Notice how the constructor is
automatically inherited.

Although everything in Python really is an object (including integral and floating point
types), you still have an escape hatch in that you can optimize performance-critical portions
of your code by writing extensions in C, C++ or a special tool called Pyrex, which is designed
to easily speed up your code. This way you can have object purity without being prevented
from performance improvements.

The PHP language ‚Åµ goes even further by having only a single array type, which acts as both
an int-indexed array and an associative array (a Map).

‚Åµ See www.php.net.

It's interesting to speculate, after this many years of Java evolution, whether the designers
would put primitives and low-level arrays in the language if they were to start over again. If
these were left out, it would be possible to make a truly pure object-oriented language
(despite claims, Java is not a pure 0 0 language, precisely because of the low-level detritus).
The initial argument for efficiency always seems compelling, but over time we have seen an
evolution away from this idea and towards the use of higher-level components like
containers. Add to this the fact that if containers can be built into the core language as they
are in some languages, then the compiler has a much better opportunity to optimize.
Green-fields speculation aside, we are certainly stuck with arrays, and you will see them
when reading code. Containers, however, are almost always a better choice.

# üìú 24. Graphical User Interfaces
A fundamental design guideline is "Make simple things easy, and
difficult things possible." ¬π

¬π A variation on this is called "the principle of least astonishment," which essentially says, 
"Don't surprise the user."

The original design goal of the graphical user interface (GUI) library in Java l.o was to allow
the programmer to build a GUI that looks good on all platforms. That goal was not achieved.
Instead, the Java l.o Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) produced a GUI that looked equally
mediocre on all systems. In addition, it was restrictive; you could use only four fonts and you
couldn't access any of the more sophisticated GUI elements that exist in your operating
system. The Java 1.0 AWT programming model was also awkward and non-object-oriented.
A student in one of my seminars (who had been at Sun during the creation of Java) explained
why: The original AWT had been conceived, designed, and implemented in a month.

Certainly a marvel of productivity, and also an object lesson in why design is important.
The situation improved with the Java 1.1 AWT event model, which takes a much clearer,
object-oriented approach, along with the addition of JavaBeans, a component programming
model that is oriented toward the easy creation of visual programming environments. Java 2
(JDK 1.2) finished the transformation away from the old Java 1.0 AWT by essentially
replacing everything with the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), the GUI portion of which is
called "Swing." These are a rich set of easy-to-use, easy-to-understand JavaBeans that can be
dragged and dropped (as well as hand programmed) to create a reasonable GUI. The
"revision 3" rule of the software industry (a product isn't good until revision 3) seems to hold
true with programming languages as well.

This chapter introduces the modern Java Swing library and makes the reasonable
assumption that Swing is Sun's final destination GUI library for Java. ¬≤ If for some reason you
need to use the original "old" AWT (because you're supporting old code or you have browser
limitations), you can find that introduction in the 1 st edition of this book, downloadable at
www.MindView.net. Note that some AWT components remain in Java, and in some
situations you must use them.


¬≤ Note that IBM created a new open-source GUI library for their Eclipse editor (www.Eclipse.org), 
which you may want to consider as an alternative to Swing. This will be introduced later in the chapter.

Please be aware that this is not a comprehensive glossary of either all the Swing components
or all the methods for the described classes. What you see here is intended to be a simple
introduction. The Swing library is vast, and the goal of this chapter is only to get you started
with the essentials and comfortable with the concepts. If you need to do more than what you
see here, then Swing can probably give you what you want if you're willing to do the research.
I assume here that you have downloaded and installed the JDK documentation from
http://java.sun.com and will browse the javax.swing classes in that documentation to see
the full details and methods of the Swing library. You can also search the Web, but the best
place to start is Sun's own Swing Tutorial at
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing.

There are numerous (rather thick) books dedicated solely to Swing, and you'll want to go to
those if you need more depth, or if you want to modify the default Swing behavior.
As you learn about Swing, you'll discover:
1. Swing is a much improved programming model compared to many other languages
and development environments (not to suggest that it's perfect, but a step forward on
the path). JavaBeans (introduced toward the end of this chapter) is the framework for
that library.

2. "GUI builders" (visual programming environments) are a de rigueur aspect of a
complete Java development environment. JavaBeans and Swing allow the GUI builder
to write code for you as you place components onto forms using graphical tools. This
rapidly speeds development during GUI building, and also allows for greater
experimentation and thus the ability to try out more designs and presumably come up
with better ones.

3. Because Swing is reasonably straightforward, even if you do use a GUI builder rather
than coding by hand, the resulting code should still be comprehensible. This solves a
big problem with GUI builders from the past, which could easily generate unreadable
code.

Swing contains all the components that you expect to see in a modern UI: everything from
buttons that contain pictures to trees and tables. It's a big library, but it's designed to have
appropriate complexity for the task at hand; if something is simple, you don't have to write
much code, but as you try to do more complex things, your code becomes proportionally
more complex.

Much of what you'll like about Swing might be called "orthogonality of use." That is, once you
pick up the general ideas about the library, you can usually apply them everywhere. Primarily
because of the standard naming conventions, while I was writing these examples I could
usually guess successfully at the method names. This is certainly a hallmark of good library
design. In addition, you can generally plug components into other components and things
will work correctly.

Keyboard navigation is automatic; you can run a Swing application without using the mouse,
and this doesn't require any extra programming. Scrolling support is effortless; you simply
wrap your component in a JScrollPane as you add it to your form. Features such as tool
tips typically require a single line of code to use.

For portability, Swing is written entirely in Java.

Swing also supports a rather radical feature called "pluggable look and feel," which means
that the appearance of the UI can be dynamically changed to suit the expectations of users
working under different platforms and operating systems. It's even possible (albeit difficult)
to invent your own look and feel. You can find some of these on the Web. ¬≥

¬≥ My favorite example of this is Ken Arnold's "Napkin" look and feel, which makes the 
windows look like they were scribbled on a napkin. See http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net.

Despite all of its positive aspects, Swing is not for everyone nor has it solved all the user
interface problems that its designers intended. At the end of the chapter, we'll look at two
alternative solutions to Swing: the IBM-sponsored SWT, developed for the Eclipse editor but
freely available as an open-source, standalone GUI library, and Macromedia's Flex tool for
developing Flash client-side front ends for Web applications.

## üçÄ24.01 Applets
When Java first appeared, much of the brouhaha around the language came from the applet,
a program that can be delivered across the Internet to run (inside a so-called sandbox, for
security) in a Web browser. People foresaw the Java applet as the next stage in the evolution
of the Internet, and many of the original books on Java assumed that the reason you were
interested in the language was that you wanted to write applets.

For various reasons, this revolution never happened. A large part of the problem was that
most machines don't include the necessary Java software to run applets, and downloading
and installing a 10 MB package in order to run something you've casually encountered on the
Web is not something most users are willing to do. Many users are even frightened by the
idea. Java applets as a client-side application delivery system never achieved critical mass,
and although you will still occasionally see an applet, they have generally been relegated to
the backwaters of computing.

This doesn't mean that applets are not an interesting and valuable technology. If you are in a
situation where you can ensure that users have a JRE installed (such as inside a corporate
environment), then applets (or JNLP/Java Web Start, described later in this chapter) might
be the perfect way to distribute client programs and automatically update everyone's
machine without the usual cost and effort of distributing and installing new software.

You'll find an introduction to the technology of applets in the online supplements to this
book at www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ24.02 Swing basics
Most Swing applications will be built inside a basic JFrame, which creates the window in
whatever operating system you're using. The title of the window can be set using the
JFrame constructor, like this:

```java
//: gui/HelloSwing.java
import javax.swing.*;

public class HelloSwing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello Swing");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(300, 100);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
} ///:~
```
setDefaultCloseOperation( ) tells the JFrame what to do when the user executes a
shutdown maneuver. The EXIT_ON_CLOSE constant tells it to exit the program. Without
this call, the default behavior is to do nothing, so the application wouldn't close.
setSize( ) sets the size of the window in pixels.

Notice the last line:

    frame.setVisible(true);

Without this, you won't see anything on the screen.

We can make things a little more interesting by adding a JLabel to the JFrame:

```java
//: gui/HelloLabel.java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class HelloLabel {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello Swing");
        JLabel label = new JLabel("A Label");
        frame.add(label);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(300, 100);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        label.setText("Hey! This is Different!");
    }
} ///:~
```
After one second, the text of the JLabel changes. While this is entertaining and safe for such
a trivial program, it's really not a good idea for the main( ) thread to write directly to the
GUI components. Swing has its own thread dedicated to receiving UI events and updating
the screen. If you start manipulating the screen with other threads, you can have the
collisions and deadlock described in the Concurrency chapter.

Instead, other threads‚Äîlike main( ), here‚Äîshould submit tasks to be executed by the Swing
event dispatch thread. ‚Å¥ You do this by handing a task to SwingUtilities.invokeLater( ),
which puts it on the event queue to be (eventually) executed by the event dispatch thread. If
we do this with the previous example, it looks like this:

‚Å¥ Technically, the event dispatch thread comes from the AWT library.

```java
//: gui/SubmitLabelManipulationTask.java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class SubmitLabelManipulationTask {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello Swing");
        final JLabel label = new JLabel("A Label");
        frame.add(label);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(300, 100);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                label.setText("Hey! This is Different!");
            }
        });
    }
} ///:~
```
Now you are no longer manipulating the JLabel directly. Instead, you submit a Runnable,
and the event dispatch thread will do the actual manipulation, when it gets to that task in the
event queue. And when it's executing this Runnable, it's not doing anything else, so there
won't be any collisions‚Äîif all the code in your program follows this approach of submitting
manipulations through SwingUtilities.invokeLater( ). This includes starting the program
itself‚Äîmain( ) should not call the Swing methods as it does in the above program, but

instead should submit a task to the event queue. ‚Åµ So the properly written program will look
something like this:

‚Åµ This practice was added in Java SE5, so you will see lots of older programs that don't do it.
That doesn't mean the authors were ignorant. The suggested practices seem to be constantly evolving.

```java
//: gui/SubmitSwingProgram.java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class SubmitSwingProgram extends JFrame {
    JLabel label;
    public SubmitSwingProgram() {
        super("Hello Swing");
        label = new JLabel("A Label");
        add(label);
        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        setSize(300, 100);
        setVisible(true);
    }
    static SubmitSwingProgram ssp;
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() { ssp = new SubmitSwingProgram(); }
        });
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                ssp.label.setText("Hey! This is Different!");
            }
        });
    }
} ///:~
```
Notice that the call to sleep( ) is not inside the constructor. If you put it there, the original
JLabel text never appears, for one thing, because the constructor doesn't complete until
after the sleep( ) finishes and the new label is inserted. But if sleep( ) is inside the
constructor, or inside any UI operation, it means that you're halting the event dispatch
thread during the sleep( ), which is generally a bad idea.

Exercise 1: (1) Modify HelloSwing.java to prove to yourself that the application will
not close without the call to setDefaultCloseOperation( ).

Exercise 2: (2) Modify HelloLabel.java to show that label addition is dynamic, by
adding a random number of labels.

### ‚òò A display framework
We can combine the ideas above and reduce redundant code by creating a display framework
for use in the Swing examples in the rest of this chapter:
```java
//: net/mindview/util/SwingConsole.java
// Tool for running Swing demos from the
// console, both applets and JFrames.
package net.mindview.util;
import javax.swing.*;

public class SwingConsole {
    public static void

    run(final JFrame f, final int width, final int height) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                f.setTitle(f.getClass().getSimpleName());
                f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
                f.setSize(width, height);
                f.setVisible(true);
            }
        });
    }
} ///:~
```
This is a tool you may want to use yourself, so it's placed in the library net.mindview.util.
To use it, your application must be in a JFrame (which all the examples in this book are).
The static run( ) method sets the title of the window to the simple class name of the
JFrame.

Exercise 3: (3) Modify SubmitSwingProgram.java so that it uses SwingConsole.

## üçÄ24.03 Making a button
Making a button is quite simple: You just call the JButton constructor with the label you
want on the button. You'll see later that you can do fancier things, like putting graphic images
on buttons.

Usually, you'll want to create a field for the button inside your class so that you can refer to it
later.

The JButton is a component‚Äîits own little window‚Äîthat will automatically get repainted as
part of an update. This means that you don't explicitly paint a button or any other kind of
control; you simply place them on the form and let them automatically take care of painting
themselves. You'll usually place a button on a form inside the constructor:

```java
//: gui/Button1.java
// Putting buttons on a Swing application.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Button1 extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Button 1"),
        b2 = new JButton("Button 2");
    public Button1() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Button1(), 200, 100);
    }
} ///:~
```
Something new has been added here: Before any elements are placed on the JFrame, it is
given a "layout manager," of type FlowLayout. The layout manager is the way that the pane
implicitly decides where to place controls on a form. The normal behavior of a JFrame is to
use the BorderLayout, but that won't work here because (as you will learn later in this
chapter) it defaults to covering each control entirely with every new one that is added.

However, FlowLayout causes the controls to flow evenly onto the form, left to right and top
to bottom.

Exercise 4: (1) Verify that without the setLayout( ) call in Buttoni.java, only one
button will appear in the resulting program.

## üçÄ24.04 Capturing an event
If you compile and run the preceding program, nothing happens when you press the buttons.
This is where you must step in and write some code to determine what will happen. The basis
of event-driven programming, which comprises a lot of what a GUI is about, is connecting
events to the code that responds to those events.

The way this is accomplished in Swing is by cleanly separating the interface (the graphical
components) from the implementation (the code that you want to run when an event
happens to a component). Each Swing component can report all the events that might
happen to it, and it can report each kind of event individually. So if you're not interested in,
for example, whether the mouse is being moved over your button, you don't register your
interest in that event. It's a very straightforward and elegant way to handle event-driven
programming, and once you understand the basic concepts, you can easily use Swing
components that you haven't seen before‚Äîin fact, this model extends to anything that can be
classified as a JavaBean (discussed later in the chapter).

At first, we will just focus on the main event of interest for the components being used. In the
case of a JButton, this "event of interest" is that the button is pressed. To register your
interest in a button press, you call the JButton's addActionListener( ) method. This
method expects an argument that is an object that implements the ActionListener
interface. That interface contains a single method called actionPerformed( ). So to attach
code to a JButton, implement the ActionListener interface in a class, and register an
object of that class with the JButton via addActionListener( ). The
actionPerformed( ) method will then be called when the button is pressed (this is
normally referred to as a callback).

But what should the result of pressing that button be? We'd like to see something change on
the screen, so a new Swing component will be introduced: the JTextField. This is a place
where text can be typed by the end user or, in this case, inserted by the program. Although
there are a number of ways to create a JTextField, the simplest is just to tell the constructor
how wide you want that field to be. Once the JTextField is placed on the form, you can
modify its contents by using the setText( ) method (there are many other methods in
JTextField, but you must look these up in the JDK documentation from
http://java.sun.com). Here is what it looks like:

```java
//: gui/Button2.java
// Responding to button presses.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Button2 extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Button 1"),
        b2 = new JButton("Button 2");
    private JTextField txt = new JTextField(10);
    class ButtonListener implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String name = ((JButton) e.getSource()).getText();
            txt.setText(name);
        }
    }
    private ButtonListener bl = new ButtonListener();
    public Button2() {
        b1.addActionListener(bl);
        b2.addActionListener(bl);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
        add(txt);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Button2(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```
Creating a JTextField and placing it on the canvas takes the same steps as for JButtons or
for any Swing component. The difference in the preceding program is in the creation of the
aforementioned ActionListener class ButtonListener. The argument to
actionPerformed( ) is of type ActionEvent, which contains all the information about the
event and where it came from. In this case, I wanted to describe the button that was pressed;
getSource( ) produces the object where the event originated, and I assumed (using a cast)
that the object is a JButton. getText( ) returns the text that's on the button, and this is
placed in the JTextField to prove that the code was actually called when the button was
pressed.

In the constructor, addActionListener( ) is used to register the ButtonListener object
with both the buttons.

It is often more convenient to code the ActionListener as an anonymous inner class,
especially since you tend to use only a single instance of each listener class. Button2.java
can be modified to use an anonymous inner class as follows:

```java
//: gui/Button2b.java
// Using anonymous inner classes.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Button2b extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Button 1"),
        b2 = new JButton("Button 2");
    private JTextField txt = new JTextField(10);
    private ActionListener bl = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String name = ((JButton) e.getSource()).getText();
            txt.setText(name);
        }
    };
    public Button2b() {
        b1.addActionListener(bl);
        b2.addActionListener(bl);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
        add(txt);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Button2b(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```

The approach of using an anonymous inner class will be preferred (when possible) for the
examples in this book.

Exercise 5: (4) Create an application using the SwingConsole class. Include one text
field and three buttons. When you press each button, make different text appear in the text
field.

## üçÄ24.05 Text areas
A JTextArea is like a JTextField except that it can have multiple lines and has more
functionality. A particularly useful method is append( ); with this you can easily pour
output into the JTextArea. Because you can scroll backwards, this is an improvement over
command-line programs that print to standard output. As an example, the following program
fills a JTextArea with the output from the Countries generator in the Containers in Depth
chapter:

```java
//: gui/TextArea.java
// Using the JTextArea control.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TextArea extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b = new JButton("Add Data"),
        c = new JButton("Clear Data");
    private JTextArea t = new JTextArea(20, 40);
    private Map < String, String > m =
        new HashMap < String, String > ();
    public TextArea() {
        // Use up all the data:
        m.putAll(Countries.capitals());
        b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                for (Map.Entry me: m.entrySet())
                    t.append(me.getKey() + ": " + me.getValue() + "\n");
            }
        });
        c.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                t.setText("");
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(new JScrollPane(t));
        add(b);
        add(c);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TextArea(), 475, 425);
    }
} ///:~
```

In the constructor, the Map is filled with all the countries and their capitals. Note that for
both buttons, the ActionListener is created and added without defining an intermediate
variable, since you never need to refer to that listener again during the program. The "Add
Data" button formats and appends all the data, and the "Clear Data" button uses setText( )
to remove all the text from the JTextArea.

As the JTextArea is added to the JFrame, it is wrapped in a JScrollPane to control
scrolling when too much text is placed on the screen. That's all you must do in order to
produce full scrolling capabilities. Having tried to figure out how to do the equivalent in some
other GUI programming environments, I am very impressed with the simplicity and good
design of components like JScrollPane.

Exercise 6: (7) Turn strings/TestRegularExpression.java into an interactive Swing
program that allows you to put an input string in one JTextArea and a regular expression in
a JTextField. The results should be displayed in a second JTextArea.

Exercise 7: (5) Create an application using SwingConsole, and add all the Swing
components that have an addActionListener( ) method. (Look these up in the JDK
documentation from http://java.sun.com. Hint: Search for addActionListener( ) using
the index.) Capture their events and display an appropriate message for each inside a text
field.

Exercise 8: (6) Almost every Swing component is derived from Component, which has
a setCursor( ) method. Look this up in the JDK documentation. Create an application and
change the cursor to one of the stock cursors in the Cursor class.

## üçÄ24.06 Controlling layout
The way that you place components on a form in Java is probably different from any other
GUI system you've used. First, it's all code; there are no "resources" that control placement of
components. Second, the way components are placed on a form is controlled not by absolute
positioning but by a "layout manager" that decides how the components lie based on the
order that you add( ) them. The size, shape, and placement of components will be
remarkably different from one layout manager to another. In addition, the layout managers
adapt to the dimensions of your applet or application window, so if the window dimension is
changed, the size, shape, and placement of the components can change in response.

JApplet, JFrame, JWindow, JDialog, JPanel, etc., can all contain and display
Components. In Container, there's a method called setLayout( ) that allows you to
choose a different layout manager. In this section we'll explore the various layout managers
by placing buttons in them (since that's the simplest thing to do). These examples won't
capture the button events because they are only intended to show how the buttons are laid
out.

### ‚òò BorderLayout
Unless you tell it otherwise, a JFrame will use BorderLayout as its default layout scheme.
Without any other instruction, this takes whatever you add( ) to it and places it in the
center, stretching the object all the way out to the edges.

BorderLayout has the concept of four border regions and a center area. When you add
something to a panel that's using a BorderLayout, you can use the overloaded add( )
method that takes a constant value as its first argument. This value can be any of the
following:

    BorderLayout.NORTH     Top
    BorderLayout.SOUTH     Bottom
    BorderLayout.EAST     Right
    BorderLayout.WEST     Left
    BorderLayout.CENTER   Fill the middle, up to the other components or to the edges

If you don't specify an area to place the object, it defaults to CENTER.

In this example, the default layout is used, since JFrame defaults to BorderLayout:

```java
//: gui/BorderLayout1.java
// Demonstrates BorderLayout.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class BorderLayout1 extends JFrame {
    public BorderLayout1() {
        add(BorderLayout.NORTH, new JButton("North"));
        add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, new JButton("South"));
        add(BorderLayout.EAST, new JButton("East"));
        add(BorderLayout.WEST, new JButton("West"));
        add(BorderLayout.CENTER, new JButton("Center"));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new BorderLayout1(), 300, 250);
    }
} ///:~
```
For every placement but CENTER, the element that you add is compressed to fit in the
smallest amount of space along one dimension while it is stretched to the maximum along
the other dimension. CENTER, however, spreads out in both dimensions to occupy the
middle.

### ‚òò FlowLayout
This simply "flows" the components onto the form, from left to right until the top space is
full, then moves down a row and continues flowing.

Here's an example that sets the layout manager to FlowLayout and then places buttons on
the form. You'll notice that with FlowLayout, the components take on their "natural" size. 
A JButton, for example, will be the size of its string.

```java
//: gui/FlowLayout1.java
// Demonstrates FlowLayout.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class FlowLayout1 extends JFrame {
    public FlowLayout1() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
            add(new JButton("Button " + i));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new FlowLayout1(), 300, 300);
    }
} ///:~
```
All components will be compacted to their smallest size in a FlowLayout, so you might get a
little bit of surprising behavior. For example, because a JLabel will be the size of its string,
attempting to right-justify its text yields an unchanged display when using FlowLayout.

Notice that if you resize the window, the layout manager will reflow the components
accordingly.

### ‚òò GridLayout
A GridLayout allows you to build a table of components, and as you add them, they are
placed left to right and top to bottom in the grid. In the constructor, you specify the number
of rows and columns that you need, and these are laid out in equal proportions.

```java
//: gui/GridLayout1.java
// Demonstrates GridLayout.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class GridLayout1 extends JFrame {
    public GridLayout1() {
        setLayout(new GridLayout(7,3));
        for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
        add(new JButton("Button " + i));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new GridLayout1(), 300, 300);
    }
} ///:~
```
In this case there are 21 slots but only 20 buttons. The last slot is left empty because no
"balancing" goes on with a GridLayout.

### ‚òò GridBagLayout
The GridBagLayout provides you with tremendous control in deciding exactly how the
regions of your window will lay themselves out and reformat themselves when the window is
resized. However, it's also the most complicated layout manager, and is quite difficult to
understand. It is intended primarily for automatic code generation by a GUI builder (GUI
builders might use GridBagLayout instead of absolute placement). If your design is so
complicated that you feel you need to use GridBagLayout, then you should be using a GUI
builder tool to generate that design. If you feel you must know the intricate details, I'll refer
you to one of the dedicated Swing books as a starting point.

As an alternative, you may want to consider TableLayout, which is not part of the Swing
library but which can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com. This component is layered
on top of GridBagLayout and hides most of its complexity, so it can greatly simplify this
approach.

### ‚òò Absolute positioning
It is also possible to set the absolute position of the graphical components:
1. Set a null layout manager for your Container: setLayout(null).

2. Call setBounds( ) or reshape( ) (depending on the language version) for each
component, passing a bounding rectangle in pixel coordinates. You can do this in the
constructor or in paint( ), depending on what you want to achieve.

Some GUI builders use this approach extensively, but this is usually not the best way to
generate code.

### ‚òò BoxLayout
Because people had so much trouble understanding and working with GridBagLayout,
Swing also includes BoxLayout, which gives you many of the benefits of GridBagLayout
without the complexity. You can often use it when you need to do hand-coded layouts (again,
if your design becomes too complex, use a GUI builder that generates layouts for you).

BoxLayout allows you to control the placement of components either vertically or
horizontally, and to control the space between the components using something called
"struts and glue." You can find some basic examples of BoxLayout in the online
supplements for this book at www.MindView.net.

### ‚òò The best approach?
Swing is powerful; it can get a lot done with a few lines of code. The examples shown in this
book are quite simple, and for learning purposes it makes sense to write them by hand. You
can actually accomplish quite a bit by combining simple layouts. At some point, however, it
stops making sense to hand-code GUI forms; it becomes too complicated and is not a good
use of your programming time. The Java and Swing designers oriented the language and
libraries to support GUI-building tools, which have been created for the express purpose of
making your programming experience easier. As long as you understand what's going on
with layouts and how to deal with events (described next), it's not particularly important that
you actually know the details of how to lay out components by hand; let the appropriate tool
do that for you (Java is, after all, designed to increase programmer productivity).

## üçÄ24.07 The Swing event model
In the Swing event model, a component can initiate ("fire") an event. Each type of event is
represented by a distinct class. When an event is fired, it is received by one or more
"listeners," which act on that event. Thus, the source of an event and the place where the
event is handled can be separate. Since you typically use Swing components as they are, but
need to write custom code that is called when the components receive an event, this is an
excellent example of the separation of interface from implementation.

Each event listener is an object of a class that implements a particular type of listener
interface. So as a programmer, all you do is create a listener object and register it with the
component that's firing the event. This registration is performed by calling an
addXXXListener( ) method in the event-firing component, in which "XXX" represents
the type of event listened for. You can easily know what types of events can be handled by
noticing the names of the "addListener" methods, and if you try to listen for the wrong
events, you'll discover your mistake at compile time. You'll see later in the chapter that

JavaBeans also use the names of the "addListener" methods to determine what events a Bean
can handle.

All of your event logic, then, will go inside a listener class. When you create a listener class,
the sole restriction is that it must implement the appropriate interface. You can create a
global listener class, but this is a situation in which inner classes tend to be quite useful, not
only because they provide a logical grouping of your listener classes inside the UI or business
logic classes they are serving, but also because an inner-class object keeps a reference to its
parent object, which provides a nice way to call across class and subsystem boundaries.

All the examples so far in this chapter have been using the Swing event model, but the
remainder of this section will fill out the details of that model.

### ‚òò Event and listener types
All Swing components include addXXXListener( ) and removeXXXListener( )
methods so that the appropriate types of listeners can be added and removed from each
component. You'll notice that the "XXX" in each case also represents the argument for the
method, for example, addMyListener(MyListener m). The following table includes the
basic associated events, listeners, and methods, along with the basic components that
support those particular events by providing the addXXXListener( ) and
removeXXXListener( ) methods. You should keep in mind that the event model is
designed to be extensible, so you may encounter other events and listener types that are not
covered in this table.

    Event, listener interface, and         Components supporting this event
    add- and remove-methods

    ActionEvent                            JButton, JList, JTextField,
    ActionListener                         JMenuItem and its derivatives
    addActionListener( )                   including JCheckBoxMenuItem,
    removeActionListener( )                JMenu, and JRadioButtonMenuItem

    AdjustmentEvent                        JScrollbar
    AdjustmentListener                     and anything you create that
    addAdjustmentListener( )               implements the Adjustable
    removeAdjustmentListener( )            interface

    ComponentEvent                        *Component and its derivatives,
    ComponentListener                      including JButton, JCheckBox,

    removeComponentListener( )             JApplet, JScrollPane, Window,
                                           JDialog, JFileDialog, JFrame,
                                           JLabel, JList, JScrollbar,
                                           JTextArea, and JTextField

    ContainerEvent                         Container and its derivatives,
    addContainerListener( )                JScrollPane, Window, JDialog,
    removeContainerListener( )             JFileDialog, and JFrame

    removeMouseMotionListener( )

    WindowEvent                            Window and its derivatives,
    WindowListener                         including JDialog, JFileDialog,
    addWindowListener( )                   and JFrame
    removeWindowListener( )

    ItemEvent                              JCheckBox,
    ItemListener                           JCheckBoxMenuItem,
    addItemListener( )                     JComboBox, JList, and anything
    removeItemListener( )                  that implements the ItemSelectable interface

    TextEvent                              Anything derived from
    TextListener                           JTextComponent, including
    addTextListener( )                     JTextArea and JTextField
    removeTextListener( )

‚Å∂ There is no MouseMotionEvent even though it seems like there ought to be. Clicking and motion 
is combined into MouseEvent, so this second appearance of MouseEvent in the table is not an error.

You can see that each type of component supports only certain types of events. It turns out to
be rather tedious to look up all the events supported by each component. A simpler approach
is to modify the ShowMethods.java program from the Type Information chapter so that it
displays all the event listeners supported by any Swing component that you enter.

The Type Information chapter introduced reflection and used that feature to look up
methods for a particular class‚Äîeither the entire list of methods or a subset of those whose
names match a keyword that you provide. The magic of reflection is that it can automatically
show you all the methods for a class without forcing you to walk up the inheritance
hierarchy, examining the base classes at each level. Thus, it provides a valuable timesaving
tool for programming; because the names of most Java methods are made nicely verbose and
descriptive, you can search for the method names that contain a particular word of interest.
When you find what you think you're looking for, check the JDK documentation.

Here is the more useful GUI version of ShowMethods.java, specialized to look for the
"addListener" methods in Swing components:

```java
//: gui/ShowAddListeners.java
// Display the "addXXXListener" methods of any Swing class.

You enter the Swing class name that you want to look up in the name JTextField. The
results are extracted using regular expressions, and displayed in a JTextArea.

You'll notice that there are no buttons or other components to indicate that you want the
search to begin. That's because the JTextField is monitored by an ActionListener.

Whenever you make a change and press Enter, the list is immediately updated. If the text
field isn't empty, it is used inside Class.forName( ) to try to look up the class. If the name
is incorrect, Class.forName( ) will fail, which means that it throws an exception. This is
trapped, and the JTextArea is set to "No match." But if you type in a correct name
(capitalization counts), Class.forName( ) is successful, and getMethods( ) will return an
array of Method objects.

Two regular expressions are used here. The first, addListener, looks for "add" followed by
any word characters, followed by "Listener" and the argument list in parentheses. Notice that
this whole regular expression is surrounded by non-escaped parentheses, which means it will
be accessible as a regular expression "group" when it matches. Inside
NameL.ActionPerformed( ), a Matcher is created by passing each Method object to
the Pattern.matcher( ) method. When find( ) is called for this Matcher object, it returns
true only if a match occurs, and in that case you can select the first matching parenthesized
group by calling group(1). This string still contains qualifiers, so to strip them off, the
qualifier Pattern object is used just as it was in ShowMethods.java.

At the end of the constructor, an initial value is placed in name and the action event is run to
provide a test with initial data.

This program is a convenient way to investigate the capabilities of a Swing component. Once
you know which events a particular component supports, you don't need to look anything up
to react to that event. You simply:
1. Take the name of the event class and remove the word "Event." Add the word
"Listener" to what remains. This is the listener interface you must implement in your
inner class.

2. Implement the interface above and write out the methods for the events you want to
capture. For example, you might be looking for mouse movements, so you write code
for the mouseMoved( ) method of the MouseMotionListener interface. (You
must implement the other methods, of course, but there's often a shortcut for this,
which you'll see soon.)

3. Create an object of the listener class in Step 2. Register it with your component with
the method produced by prefixing "add" to your listener name. For example,
addMouseMotionListener( ).

Here are some of the listener interfaces:

    Listener interface w/ adapter     Methods in interface
    ActionListener                    actionPerformed(ActionEvent)
    AdjustmentListener                adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent)
    ComponentListener                 componentHidden(ComponentEvent)
    ComponentAdapter                  componentShown(ComponentEvent)
                                      componentMoved(ComponentEvent)
                                      componentResized(ComponentEvent)
    ContainerListener                 componentAdded(ContainerEvent)
    ContainerAdapter                  componentRemoved(ContainerEvent)

    FocusListener                     focusGained(FocusEvent)
    FocusAdapter                      focusLost(FocusEvent)

    KeyListener                       keyPressed(KeyEvent)
    KeyAdapter                        keyReleased(KeyEvent)
                                      keyTyped(KeyEvent)
    MouseListener                     mouseClicked(MouseEvent)
    MouseAdapter                      mouseEntered(MouseEvent)
                                      mouseExited(MouseEvent)
                                      mousePressed(MouseEvent)
                                      mouseReleased(MouseEvent)
    MouseMotionListener               mouseDragged(MouseEvent)
    MouseMotionAdapter                mouseMoved(MouseEvent)

    WindowListener                    windowOpened(WindowEvent)
    WindowAdapter                     windowClosing(WindowEvent)
                                      windowClosed(WindowEvent)
                                      windowActivated(WindowEvent)
                                      windowDeactivated(WindowEvent)
                                      windowIconified(WindowEvent)
                                      windowDeiconified(WindowEvent)
    ItemListener                      itemStateChanged(ItemEvent)

This is not an exhaustive listing, partly because the event model allows you to create your
own event types and associated listeners. Thus, you'll regularly come across libraries that
have invented their own events, and the knowledge gained in this chapter will allow you to
figure out how to use these events.

### ‚òò Using listener adapters for simplicity
In the table above, you can see that some listener interfaces have only one method. These are
trivial to implement. However, the listener interfaces that have multiple methods can be less
pleasant to use. For example, if you want to capture a mouse click (that isn't already captured
for you, for example, by a button), then you need to write a method for mouseClicked( ).
But since MouseListener is an interface, you must implement all of the other methods
even if they don't do anything. This can be annoying.

To solve the problem, some (but not all) of the listener interfaces that have more than one
method are provided with adapters, the names of which you can see in the table above. Each
adapter provides default empty methods for each of the interface methods. When you inherit
from the adapter, you override only the methods you need to change. For example, the
typical MouseListener you'll use looks like this:
```java
class MyMouseListener extends MouseAdapter {
    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        // Respond to mouse click...
    }
}
```

The whole point of the adapters is to make the creation of listener classes easy.

There is a downside to adapters, however, in the form of a pitfall. Suppose you write a
MouseAdapter like the previous one:
```java
class MyMouseListener extends MouseAdapter {
    public void MouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        // Respond to mouse click...
    }
}
```
This doesn't work, but it will drive you crazy trying to figure out why, since everything will
compile and run fine‚Äîexcept that your method won't be called for a mouse click. Can you see
the problem? It's in the name of the method: MouseClicked( ) instead of mouseClicked(
). A simple slip in capitalization results in the addition of a completely new method.

However, this is not the method that's called when the mouse is clicked, so you don't get the

desired results. Despite the inconvenience, an interface will guarantee that the methods are
properly implemented.

An improved alternative way to guarantee that you are in fact overriding a method is to use
the built-in @Override annotation in the code above.

Exercise 9: (5) Starting with ShowAddListeners.java, create a program with the full
functionality of typeinfo.ShowMethods.java.

### ‚òò Tracking multiple events
To prove to yourself that these events are in fact being fired, it's worth creating a program
that tracks behavior in a JButton beyond whether it has been pressed. This example also
shows you how to inherit your own button object from JButton. ‚Å∑

‚Å∑ In Java 1.0/1.1 you could not usefully inherit from the button object. This was only 
one of numerous fundamental design flaws.

In the code below, the MyButton class is an inner class of TrackEvent, so MyButton can
reach into the parent window and manipulate its text fields, which is necessary in order to
write the status information into the fields of the parent. Of course, this is a limited solution,
since MyButton can be used only in conjunction with TrackEvent. This kind of code is
sometimes called "highly coupled":

```java
//: gui/TrackEvent.java
// Show events as they happen.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TrackEvent extends JFrame {
    private HashMap<String, JTextField> h =
        new HashMap<String, JTextField> ();
    private String[] event = {
        "focusGained",
        "focusLost",
        "keyPressed",
        "keyReleased",
        "keyTyped",
        "mouseClicked",
        "mouseEntered",
        "mouseExited",
        "mousePressed",
        "mouseReleased",
        "mouseDragged",
        "mouseMoved"
    };
    private MyButton
    b1 = new MyButton(Color.BLUE, "test1"),
        b2 = new MyButton(Color.RED, "test2");
    class MyButton extends JButton {
        void report(String field, String msg) {
            h.get(field).setText(msg);
        }
        FocusListener fl = new FocusListener() {
            public void focusGained(FocusEvent e) {
                report("focusGained", e.paramString());
            }
            public void focusLost(FocusEvent e) {
                report("focusLost", e.paramString());
            }
        };
        KeyListener kl = new KeyListener() {
            public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
                report("keyPressed", e.paramString());

            }
            public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
                report("keyReleased", e.paramString());
            }
            public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
                report("keyTyped", e.paramString());
            }
        };
        MouseListener ml = new MouseListener() {
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseClicked", e.paramString());
            }
            public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseEntered", e.paramString());
            }
            public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseExited", e.paramString());
            }
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mousePressed", e.paramString());
            }
            public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseReleased", e.paramString());
            }
        };
        MouseMotionListener mml = new MouseMotionListener() {
            public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseDragged", e.paramString());
            }
            public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {
                report("mouseMoved", e.paramString());
            }
        };
        public MyButton(Color color, String label) {
            super(label);
            setBackground(color);
            addFocusListener(fl);
            addKeyListener(kl);
            addMouseListener(ml);
            addMouseMotionListener(mml);
        }
    }
    public TrackEvent() {
        setLayout(new GridLayout(event.length + 1, 2));
        for (String evt: event) {
            JTextField t = new JTextField();
            t.setEditable(false);
            add(new JLabel(evt, JLabel.RIGHT));
            add(t);
            h.put(evt, t);
        }
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TrackEvent(), 700, 500);
    }
} ///:~
```
In the MyButton constructor, the button's color is set with a call to SetBackground( ).
The listeners are all installed with simple method calls.

The TrackEvent class contains a HashMap to hold the strings representing the type of
event and JTextFields where information about that event is held. Of course, these could
have been created statically rather than putting them in a HashMap, but I think you'll agree
that it's a lot easier to use and change. In particular, if you need to add or remove a new type
of event in TrackEvent, you simply add or remove a string in the event array‚Äî everything
else happens automatically.

When report( ) is called, it is given the name of the event and the parameter string from the
event. It uses the HashMap h in the outer class to look up the actual JTextField associated
with that event name and then places the parameter string into that field.

This example is fun to play with because you can really see what's going on with the events in
your program.

Exercise 10: (6) Create an application using SwingConsole, with a JButton and a
JTextField. Write and attach the appropriate listener so that if the button has the focus,
characters typed into it will appear in the JTextField.

Exercise 11: (4) Inherit a new type of button from JButton. Each time you press this
button, it should change its color to a randomly selected value. See ColorBoxes.java (later
in this chapter) for an example of how to generate a random color value.

Exercise 12: (4) Monitor a new type of event in TrackEvent.java by adding the new
event-handling code. You'll need to discover on your own the type of event that you want to
monitor.

## üçÄ24.08 A selection of Swing components
Now that you understand layout managers and the event model, you're ready to see how
Swing components can be used. This section is a non-exhaustive tour of the Swing
components and features that you'll probably use most of the time. Each example is intended
to be reasonably small so that you can easily lift the code and use it in your own programs.
Keep in mind:
1. You can easily see what each of these examples looks like during execution by
compiling and running the downloadable source code for this chapter
(www.MindView.net).

2. The JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com contains all of the Swing classes
and methods (only a few are shown here).

3. Because of the naming convention used for Swing events, it's fairly easy to guess how
to write and install a handler for a particular type of event. Use the lookup program
ShowAddListeners.java from earlier in this chapter to aid in your investigation of
a particular component.

4. When things start to get complicated you should graduate to a GUI builder.

### ‚òò Buttons
Swing includes a number of different types of buttons. All buttons, check boxes, radio
buttons, and even menu items are inherited from AbstractButton (which, since menu
items are included, would probably have been better named "AbstractSelector" or something

equally general). You'll see the use of menu items shortly, but the following example shows
the various types of buttons available:

```java
//: gui/Buttons.java
// Various Swing buttons.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.*;
import javax.swing.plaf.basic.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Buttons extends JFrame {
    private JButton jb = new JButton("JButton");
    private BasicArrowButton
    up = new BasicArrowButton(BasicArrowButton.NORTH),
        down = new BasicArrowButton(BasicArrowButton.SOUTH),
        right = new BasicArrowButton(BasicArrowButton.EAST),
        left = new BasicArrowButton(BasicArrowButton.WEST);
    public Buttons() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(jb);
        add(new JToggleButton("JToggleButton"));
        add(new JCheckBox("JCheckBox"));
        add(new JRadioButton("JRadioButton"));
        JPanel jp = new JPanel();
        jp.setBorder(new TitledBorder("Directions"));
        jp.add(up);
        jp.add(down);
        jp.add(left);
        jp.add(right);
        add(jp);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Buttons(), 350, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```
This begins with the BasicArrowButton from javax.swing.plaf.basic, then continues
with the various specific types of buttons. When you run the example, you'll see that the
toggle button holds its last position, in or out. But the check boxes and radio buttons behave
identically to each other, just clicking on or off (they are inherited from JToggleButton).

### ‚òò Button groups
If you want radio buttons to behave in an "exclusive or" fashion, you must add them to a
"button group." But, as the following example demonstrates, any AbstractButton can be
added to a ButtonGroup.

To avoid repeating a lot of code, this example uses reflection to generate the groups of
different types of buttons. This is seen in makeBPanel( ), which creates a button group in a
JPanel. The second argument to makeBPanel( ) is an array of String. For each String, a
button of the class represented by the first argument is added to the JPanel:


```java
//: gui/ButtonGroups.java
// Uses reflection to create groups
// of different types of AbstractButton.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.lang.reflect.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class ButtonGroups extends JFrame {
    private static String[] ids = {
        "June",
        "Ward",
        "Beaver",
        "Wally",
        "Eddie",
        "Lumpy"
    };
    static JPanel makeBPanel(
        Class <? extends AbstractButton> kind, String[] ids) {
        ButtonGroup bg = new ButtonGroup();
        JPanel jp = new JPanel();
        String title = kind.getName();
        title = title.substring(title.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
        jp.setBorder(new TitledBorder(title));
        for (String id: ids) {
            AbstractButton ab = new JButton("failed");
            try {
                // Get the dynamic constructor method
                // that takes a String argument:
                Constructor ctor =
                    kind.getConstructor(String.class);
                // Create a new object:
                ab = (AbstractButton) ctor.newInstance(id);
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                System.err.println("can't create " + kind);
            }
            bg.add(ab);
            jp.add(ab);
        }
        return jp;
    }
    public ButtonGroups() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(makeBPanel(JButton.class, ids));
        add(makeBPanel(JToggleButton.class, ids));
        add(makeBPanel(JCheckBox.class, ids));
        add(makeBPanel(JRadioButton.class, ids));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new ButtonGroups(), 500, 350);
    }
} ///:~
```
The title for the border is taken from the name of the class, stripping off all the path
information. The AbstractButton is initialized to a JButton that has the label "failed," so
if you ignore the exception message, you'll still see the problem on the screen. The
getConstructor( ) method produces a Constructor object that takes the array of
arguments of the types in the list of Classes passed to getConstructor( ). Then all you do is
call newInstance( ), passing it a list of arguments‚Äîin this case, just the String from the
ids array.

To get "exclusive or" behavior with buttons, you create a button group and add each button
for which you want that behavior to the group. When you run the program, you'll see that all
the buttons except JButton exhibit this "exclusive or" behavior.

### ‚òò Icons
You can use an Icon inside a JLabel or anything that inherits from AbstractButton
(including JButton, JCheckBox, JRadioButton, and the different kinds of JMenuItem).
Using Icons with JLabels is quite straightforward (you'll see an example later). The following
example explores all the additional ways you can use Icons with buttons and their descendants.

You can use any GIF files you want, but the ones used in this example are part of this book's code
distribution, available at www.MindView.net. To open a file and bring in the image, simply create
an ImageIcon and hand it the file name. From then on, you can use the resulting Icon in your
program.

```java
//: gui/Faces.java
// Icon behavior in JButtons.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Faces extends JFrame {
    private static Icon[] faces;
    private JButton jb, jb2 = new JButton("Disable");
    private boolean mad = false;
    public Faces() {
        faces = new Icon[] {
            new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("Face0.gif")),
                new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("Face1.gif")),
                new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("Face2.gif")),
                new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("Face3.gif")),
                new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("Face4.gif")),
        };
        jb = new JButton("JButton", faces[3]);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        jb.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                if (mad) {
                    jb.setIcon(faces[3]);
                    mad = false;
                } else {
                    jb.setIcon(faces[0]);
                    mad = true;
                }
                jb.setVerticalAlignment(JButton.TOP);
                jb.setHorizontalAlignment(JButton.LEFT);
            }
        });
        jb.setRolloverEnabled(true);
        jb.setRolloverIcon(faces[1]);
        jb.setPressedIcon(faces[2]);
        jb.setDisabledIcon(faces[4]);

        add(jb);
        jb2.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                if (jb.isEnabled()) {

                    jb2.setText("Enable");
                } else {
                    jb.setEnabled(true);
                    jb2.setText("Disable");
                }
            }
        });
        add(jb2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Faces(), 250, 125);

An Icon can be used as an argument for many different Swing component constructors, but
you can also use setIcon( ) to add or change an Icon. This example also shows how a
JButton (or any AbstractButton) can set the various different sorts of icons that appear
when things happen to that button: when it's pressed, disabled, or "rolled over" (the mouse
moves over it without clicking). You'll see that this gives the button a nice animated feel.

### ‚òò Tool tips
The previous example added a "tool tip" to the button. Almost all of the classes that you'll be
using to create your user interfaces are derived from JComponent, which contains a
method called setToolTipText(String). So, for virtually anything you place on your form,
all you need to do is say (for an object j c of any JComponent-derived class):

    jc.setToolTipText("My tip");

When the mouse stays over that JComponent for a predetermined period of time, a tiny
box containing your text will pop up next to the mouse.

### ‚òò Text fields
This example shows what JTextFields can do:

```java
//: gui/TextFields.java
// Text fields and Java events.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.event.*;
import javax.swing.text.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TextFields extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Get Text"),
        b2 = new JButton("Set Text");
    private JTextField
    t1 = new JTextField(30),
        t2 = new JTextField(30),
        t3 = new JTextField(30);
    private String s = "";
    private UpperCaseDocument ucd = new UpperCaseDocument();
    public TextFields() {
        t1.setDocument(ucd);
        ucd.addDocumentListener(new T1());
        b1.addActionListener(new B1());
        b2.addActionListener(new B2());
        t1.addActionListener(new T1A());
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
        add(t1);
        add(t2);
        add(t3);
    }
    class T1 implements DocumentListener {
        public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {}
        public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
            t2.setText(t1.getText());
            t3.setText("Text: " + t1.getText());
        }
        public void removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
            t2.setText(t1.getText());
        }
    }
    class T1A implements ActionListener {
        private int count = 0;
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            t3.setText("t1 Action Event " + count++);
        }
    }
    class B1 implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            if (t1.getSelectedText() == null)
                s = t1.getText();
            else
                s = t1.getSelectedText();
            t1.setEditable(true);
        }
    }
    class B2 implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            ucd.setUpperCase(false);
            t1.setText("Inserted by Button 2: " + s);
            ucd.setUpperCase(true);
            t1.setEditable(false);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TextFields(), 375, 200);
    }
}

class UpperCaseDocument extends PlainDocument {
    private boolean upperCase = true;
    public void setUpperCase(boolean flag) {
        upperCase = flag;
    }
    public void
    insertString(int offset, String str, AttributeSet attSet)
    throws BadLocationException {
        if (upperCase) str = str.toUpperCase();
        super.insertString(offset, str, attSet);
    }
} ///:~
```
The JTextField t3 is included as a place to report when the action listener for the
JTextField t1 is fired. You'll see that the action listener for a JTextField is fired only when
you press the Enter key.

The JTextField t1 has several listeners attached to it. The T1 listener is a
DocumentListener that responds to any change in the "document" (the contents of the
JTextField, in this case). It automatically copies all text from t1 into t2. In addition, t1's
document is set to a derived class of PlainDocument, called UpperCaseDocument,
which forces all characters to uppercase. It automatically detects backspaces and performs
the deletion, adjusting the caret and handling everything as you expect.

Exercise 13: (3) Modify TextFields.java so that the characters in t2 retain the original
case that they were typed in, instead of automatically being forced to uppercase.


### ‚òò Borders
JComponent contains a method called setBorder( ), which allows you to place various
interesting borders on any visible component. The following example demonstrates a
number of the different borders that are available, using a method called showBorder( )
that creates a JPanel and puts on the border in each case. Also, it uses RTTI to find the
name of the border that you're using (stripping off all the path information), then puts that
name in a JLabel in the middle of the panel:

```java
//: gui/Borders.java
// Different Swing borders.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Borders extends JFrame {
    static JPanel showBorder(Border b) {
        JPanel jp = new JPanel();
        jp.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        String nm = b.getClass().toString();
        nm = nm.substring(nm.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
        jp.add(new JLabel(nm, JLabel.CENTER),
            BorderLayout.CENTER);
        jp.setBorder(b);
        return jp;
    }
    public Borders() {
        setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 4));
        add(showBorder(new TitledBorder("Title")));
        add(showBorder(new EtchedBorder()));
        add(showBorder(new LineBorder(Color.BLUE)));
        add(showBorder(
            new MatteBorder(5, 5, 30, 30, Color.GREEN)));
        add(showBorder(
            new BevelBorder(BevelBorder.RAISED)));
        add(showBorder(
            new SoftBevelBorder(BevelBorder.LOWERED)));
        add(showBorder(new CompoundBorder(
            new EtchedBorder(),
            new LineBorder(Color.RED))));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Borders(), 500, 300);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can also create your own borders and put them inside buttons, labels, etc.‚Äîanything
derived from JComponent.

### ‚òò A mini-editor
The JTextPane control provides a great deal of support for editing, without much effort.
The following example makes very simple use of this component, ignoring the bulk of its
functionality:

```java
//: gui/TextPane.java
// The JTextPane control is a little editor.
import javax.swing.*;

import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TextPane extends JFrame {
    private JButton b = new JButton("Add Text");
    private JTextPane tp = new JTextPane();
    private static Generator sg =
        new RandomGenerator.String(7);
    public TextPane() {
        b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
                    tp.setText(tp.getText() + sg.next() + "\n");
            }
        });
        add(new JScrollPane(tp));
        add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, b);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TextPane(), 475, 425);
    }
} ///:~
```
The button adds randomly generated text. The intent of the JTextPane is to allow text to be
edited in place, so you will see that there is no append( ) method. In this case (admittedly, a
poor use of the capabilities of JTextPane), the text must be captured, modified, and placed
back into the pane using setText( ).

Elements are added to the JFrame using its default BorderLayout. The JTextPane is
added (inside a JScrollPane) without specifying a region, so it just fills the center of the
pane out to the edges. The JButton is added to the SOUTH, so the component will fit itself
into that region; in this case, the button will nest down at the bottom of the screen.

Notice the built-in features of JTextPane, such as automatic line wrapping. There are
numerous other features that you can look up using the JDK documentation.

Exercise 14: (2) Modify TextPane.java to use a JTextArea instead of a JTextPane.

### ‚òò Check boxes
A check box provides a way to make a single on/off choice. It consists of a tiny box and a
label. The box typically holds a little "x" (or some other indication that it is set) or is empty,
depending on whether that item was selected.

You'll normally create a JCheckBox using a constructor that takes the label as an argument.
You can get and set the state, and also get and set the label if you want to read or change it
after the JCheckBox has been created.

Whenever a JCheckBox is set or cleared, an event occurs, which you can capture the same
way you do a button: by using an ActionListener. The following example uses a
JTextArea to enumerate all the check boxes that have been checked:

```java
//: gui/CheckBoxes.java
// Using JCheckBoxes.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class CheckBoxes extends JFrame {
    private JTextArea t = new JTextArea(6, 15);
    private JCheckBox
    cb1 = new JCheckBox("Check Box 1"),
        cb2 = new JCheckBox("Check Box 2"),
        cb3 = new JCheckBox("Check Box 3");
    public CheckBoxes() {
        cb1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                trace("1", cb1);
            }
        });
        cb2.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                trace("2", cb2);
            }
        });
        cb3.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                trace("3", cb3);
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(new JScrollPane(t));
        add(cb1);
        add(cb2);
        add(cb3);
    }
    private void trace(String b, JCheckBox cb) {
        if (cb.isSelected())
            t.append("Box " + b + " Set\n");
        else
            t.append("Box " + b + " Cleared\n");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new CheckBoxes(), 200, 300);
    }
} ///:~
```
The trace( ) method sends the name of the selected JCheckBox and its current state to the
JTextArea using append( ), so you'll see a cumulative list of the check boxes that were
selected, along with their state.

Exercise 15: (5) Add a check box to the application created in Exercise 5, capture the
event, and insert different text into the text field.

### ‚òò Radio buttons
The concept of radio buttons in GUI programming comes from pre-electronic car radios with
mechanical buttons: When you push one in, any other buttons pop out. Thus, it allows you to
force a single choice among many.

To set up an associated group of JRadioButtons, you add them to a ButtonGroup (you
can have any number of ButtonGroups on a form). One of the buttons can be optionally set
to true (using the second argument in the constructor). If you try to set more than one radio
button to true, then only the last one set will be true.

Here's a simple example of the use of radio buttons, showing event capture using an
ActionListener:

```java
//: gui/RadioButtons.java
// Using JRadioButtons.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class RadioButtons extends JFrame {
    private JTextField t = new JTextField(15);
    private ButtonGroup g = new ButtonGroup();
    private JRadioButton
    rb1 = new JRadioButton("one", false),
        rb2 = new JRadioButton("two", false),
        rb3 = new JRadioButton("three", false);
    private ActionListener al = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            t.setText("Radio button " +
                ((JRadioButton) e.getSource()).getText());
        }
    };
    public RadioButtons() {
        rb1.addActionListener(al);
        rb2.addActionListener(al);
        rb3.addActionListener(al);
        g.add(rb1);
        g.add(rb2);
        g.add(rb3);
        t.setEditable(false);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(t);
        add(rb1);
        add(rb2);
        add(rb3);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new RadioButtons(), 200, 125);
    }
} ///:~
```
To display the state, a text field is used. This field is set to non-editable because it's used only
to display data, not to collect it. Thus it is an alternative to using a JLabel.

### ‚òò Combo boxes (drop-down lists)
Like a group of radio buttons, a drop-down list is a way to force the user to select only one
element from a group of possibilities. However, it's a more compact way to accomplish this,
and it's easier to change the elements of the list without surprising the user. (You can change
radio buttons dynamically, but that tends to be visibly jarring.)

By default, JComboBox box is not like the combo box in Windows, which lets you select
from a list or type in your own selection. To produce this behavior you must call
setEditable( ). With a JComboBox box, you choose one and only one element from the
list. In the following example, the JComboBox box starts with a certain number of entries,
and then new entries are added to the box when a button is pressed.

```java
//: gui/ComboBoxes.java
// Using drop-down lists.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;

import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class ComboBoxes extends JFrame {
    private String[] description = {
        "Ebullient",
        "Obtuse",
        "Recalcitrant",
        "Brilliant",
        "Somnescent",
        "Timorous",
        "Florid",
        "Putrescent"
    };
    private JTextField t = new JTextField(15);
    private JComboBox c = new JComboBox();
    private JButton b = new JButton("Add items");
    private int count = 0;
    public ComboBoxes() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            c.addItem(description[count++]);
        t.setEditable(false);
        b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                if (count < description.length)
                    c.addItem(description[count++]);
            }
        });
        c.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                t.setText("index: " + c.getSelectedIndex() + " " +
                    ((JComboBox) e.getSource()).getSelectedItem());
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(t);
        add(c);
        add(b);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new ComboBoxes(), 200, 175);
    }
} ///:~
```
The JTextField displays the "selected index," which is the sequence number of the currently
selected element, as well as the text of the selected item in the combo box.

### ‚òò List boxes
List boxes are significantly different from JComboBox boxes, and not just in appearance.
While a JComboBox box drops down when you activate it, a JList occupies some fixed
number of lines on a screen all the time and doesn't change. If you want to see the items in a
list, you simply call getSelectedValues( ), which produces an array of String of the items
that have been selected.

A JList allows multiple selection; if you control-click on more than one item (holding down
the Control key while performing additional mouse clicks), the original item stays highlighted
and you can select as many as you want. If you select an item, then shift-click on another
item, all the items in the span between the two are selected. To remove an item from a group,
you can control-click it.

```java
//: gui/List.java
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.*;
import javax.swing.event.*;
import java.awt.*;

import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class List extends JFrame {
    private String[] flavors = {
        "Chocolate",
        "Strawberry",
        "Vanilla Fudge Swirl",
        "Mint Chip",
        "Mocha Almond Fudge",
        "Rum Raisin",
        "Praline Cream",
        "Mud Pie"
    };
    private DefaultListModel lItems = new DefaultListModel();
    private JList lst = new JList(lItems);
    private JTextArea t =
        new JTextArea(flavors.length, 20);
    private JButton b = new JButton("Add Item");
    private ActionListener bl = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            if (count < flavors.length) {
                lItems.add(0, flavors[count++]);
            } else {
                // Disable, since there are no more
                // flavors left to be added to the List
                b.setEnabled(false);
            }
        }
    };
    private ListSelectionListener ll =
        new ListSelectionListener() {
            public void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent e) {
                if (e.getValueIsAdjusting()) return;
                t.setText("");
                for (Object item: lst.getSelectedValues())
                    t.append(item + "\n");
            }
        };
    private int count = 0;
    public List() {
        t.setEditable(false);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        // Create Borders for components:
        Border brd = BorderFactory.createMatteBorder(
            1, 1, 2, 2, Color.BLACK);
        lst.setBorder(brd);
        t.setBorder(brd);
        // Add the first four items to the List
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            lItems.addElement(flavors[count++]);
        add(t);
        add(lst);
        add(b);
        // Register event listeners
        lst.addListSelectionListener(ll);
        b.addActionListener(bl);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new List(), 250, 375);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see that borders have also been added to the lists.

If you just want to put an array of Strings into a JList, there's a much simpler solution; you
pass the array to the JList constructor, and it builds the list automatically. The only reason

for using the "list model" in the preceding example is so that the list can be manipulated
during the execution of the program.

JLists do not automatically provide direct support for scrolling. Of course, all you need to do
is wrap the JList in a JScrollPane, and the details are automatically managed for you.

Exercise 16: (5) Simplify List.java by passing the array to the constructor and
eliminating the dynamic addition of elements to the list.

### ‚òò Tabbed panes
The JTabbedPane allows you to create a "tabbed dialog," which has filefolder tabs running
across one edge. When you press a tab, it brings forward a different dialog.

```java
//: gui/TabbedPane1.java
// Demonstrates the Tabbed Pane.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.event.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TabbedPane1 extends JFrame {
    private String[] flavors = {
        "Chocolate",
        "Strawberry",
        "Vanilla Fudge Swirl",
        "Mint Chip",
        "Mocha Almond Fudge",
        "Rum Raisin",
        "Praline Cream",
        "Mud Pie"
    };
    private JTabbedPane tabs = new JTabbedPane();
    private JTextField txt = new JTextField(20);
    public TabbedPane1() {
        int i = 0;
        for (String flavor: flavors)
            tabs.addTab(flavors[i],
                new JButton("Tabbed pane " + i++));
        tabs.addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() {
            public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) {
                txt.setText("Tab selected: " +
                    tabs.getSelectedIndex());
            }
        });
        add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, txt);
        add(tabs);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TabbedPane1(), 400, 250);
    }
} ///:~
```
When you run the program, you'll see that the JTabbedPane automatically stacks the tabs
if there are too many of them to fit on one row. You can see this by resizing the window when
you run the program from the console command line.

### ‚òò Message boxes
Windowing environments commonly contain a standard set of message boxes that allow you
to quickly post information to the user or to capture information from the user. In Swing,
these message boxes are contained in JOptionPane. You have many different possibilities
(some quite sophisticated), but the ones you'll most commonly use are probably the message
dialog and confirmation dialog, invoked using the static
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( ) and JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog( ).

The following example shows a subset of the message boxes available with JOptionPane:

```java
//: gui/MessageBoxes.java
// Demonstrates JOptionPane.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class MessageBoxes extends JFrame {
    private JButton[] b = {
        new JButton("Alert"),
        new JButton("Yes/No"),
        new JButton("Color"),
        new JButton("Input"),
        new JButton("3 Vals")
    };
    private JTextField txt = new JTextField(15);
    private ActionListener al = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String id = ((JButton) e.getSource()).getText();
            if (id.equals("Alert"))
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,
                    "There's a bug on you!", "Hey!",
                    JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
            else if (id.equals("Yes/No"))
                JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,
                    "or no", "choose yes",
                    JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION);
            else if (id.equals("Color")) {
                Object[] options = { "Red", "Green" };
                int sel = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(
                    null, "Choose a Color!", "Warning",
                    JOptionPane.DEFAULT_OPTION,
                    JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE, null,
                    options, options[0]);
                if (sel != JOptionPane.CLOSED_OPTION)
                    txt.setText("Color Selected: " + options[sel]);
            } else if (id.equals("Input")) {
                String val = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(
                    "How many fingers do you see?");
                txt.setText(val);
            } else if (id.equals("3 Vals")) {
                Object[] selections = { "First", "Second", "Third" };
                Object val = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(
                    null, "Choose one", "Input",
                    JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE,
                    null, selections, selections[0]);
                if (val != null)
                    txt.setText(val.toString());
            }
        }
    };
    public MessageBoxes() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
            b[i].addActionListener(al);
            add(b[i]);
        }
        add(txt);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new MessageBoxes(), 200, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```
To write a single ActionListener, I've used the somewhat risky approach of checking the
String labels on the buttons. The problem with this is that it's easy to get the label a little bit
wrong, typically in capitalization, and this bug can be hard to spot.

Note that showOptionDialog( ) and showInputDialog( ) provide return objects that
contain the value entered by the user.

Exercise 17: (5) Create an application using SwingConsole. In the JDK documentation
from http://java.sun.com, find the JPasswordField and add this to the program. If the
user types in the correct password, use JOptionPane to provide a success message to the
user.

Exercise 18: (4) Modify MessageBoxes.java so that it has an individual
ActionListener for each button (instead of matching the button text).

### ‚òò Menus
Each component capable of holding a menu, including JApplet, JFrame, JDialog, and
their descendants, has a setJMenuBar( ) method that accepts a JMenuBar (you can have
only one JMenuBar on a particular component). You add JMenus to the JMenuBar, and
JMenuItems to the JMenus. Each JMenuItem can have an ActionListener attached to
it, to be fired when that menu item is selected.

With Java and Swing you must hand assemble all the menus in source code. Here is a very
simple menu example:

```java
//: gui/SimpleMenus.java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class SimpleMenus extends JFrame {
    private JTextField t = new JTextField(15);
    private ActionListener al = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            t.setText(((JMenuItem) e.getSource()).getText());
        }
    };
    private JMenu[] menus = {
        new JMenu("Winken"),
        new JMenu("Blinken"),
        new JMenu("Nod")
    };
    private JMenuItem[] items = {
        new JMenuItem("Fee"),
        new JMenuItem("Fi"),
        new JMenuItem("Fo"),
        new JMenuItem("Zip"),
        new JMenuItem("Zap"),
        new JMenuItem("Zot"),
        new JMenuItem("Olly"),
        new JMenuItem("Oxen"),
        new JMenuItem("Free")
    };
    public SimpleMenus() {
        for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
            items[i].addActionListener(al);
            menus[i % 3].add(items[i]);
        }
        JMenuBar mb = new JMenuBar();
        for (JMenu jm: menus)
            mb.add(jm);
        setJMenuBar(mb);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(t);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new SimpleMenus(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```
The use of the modulus operator in "i%3" distributes the menu items among the three
JMenus. Each JMenuItem must have an ActionListener attached to it; here, the same
ActionListener is used everywhere, but you'll usually need an individual one for each
JMenuItem.

JMenuItem inherits AbstractButton, so it has some button-like behaviors. By itself, it
provides an item that can be placed on a drop-down menu. There are also three types
inherited from JMenuItem: JMenu, to hold other JMenuItems (so you can have cascading
menus); JCheckBoxMenuItem, which produces a check mark to indicate whether that
menu item is selected; and JRadioButtonMenuItem, which contains a radio button.

As a more sophisticated example, here are the ice cream flavors again, used to create menus.
This example also shows cascading menus, keyboard mnemonics, JCheckBoxMenuItems,
and the way that you can dynamically change menus:

```java
//: gui/Menus.java
// Submenus, check box menu items, swapping menus,
// mnemonics (shortcuts) and action commands.

        "Mocha Almond Fudge",
        "Rum Raisin",
        "Praline Cream",
        "Mud Pie"
    };

    f = new JMenu("File"),

In this program I placed the menu items into arrays and then stepped through each array,
calling add( ) for each JMenuItem. This makes adding or subtracting a menu item
somewhat less tedious.

This program creates two JMenuBars to demonstrate that menu bars can be actively
swapped while the program is running. You can see how a JMenuBar is made up of
JMenus, and each JMenu is made up of JMenuItems, JCheckBoxMenuItems, or even
other JMenus (which produce submenus). When a JMenuBar is assembled, it can be
installed into the current program with the setJMenuBar( ) method. Note that when the

button is pressed, it checks to see which menu is currently installed by calling
getJMenuBar( ), then it puts the other menu bar in its place.

When testing for "Open," notice that spelling and capitalization are critical, but Java signals
no error if there is no match with "Open." This kind of string comparison is a source of
programming errors.

The checking and unchecking of the menu items is taken care of automatically. The code
handling the JCheckBoxMenuItems shows two different ways to determine what was
checked: string matching (the less-safe approach, although you'll see it used) and matching
on the event target object. As shown, the getState( ) method can be used to reveal the state.
You can also change the state of a JCheckBoxMenuItem with setState( ).

The events for menus are a bit inconsistent and can lead to confusion: JMenuItems use
ActionListeners, but JCheckBoxMenuItems use ItemListeners. The JMenu objects
can also support ActionListeners, but that's not usually helpful. In general, you'll attach
listeners to each JMenuItem, JCheckBoxMenuItem, or JRadioButtonMenuItem,
but the example shows ItemListeners and ActionListeners attached to the various menu
components.

Swing supports mnemonics, or "keyboard shortcuts," so you can select anything derived from
AbstractButton (button, menu item, etc.) by using the keyboard instead of the mouse.
These are quite simple; for JMenuItem, you can use the overloaded constructor that takes,
as a second argument, the identifier for the key. However, most AbstractButtons do not
have constructors like this, so the more general way to solve the problem is to use the
setMnemonic( ) method. The preceding example adds mnemonics to the button and some
of the menu items; shortcut indicators automatically appear on the components.

You can also see the use of setActionCommand( ). This seems a bit strange because in
each case, the "action command" is exactly the same as the label on the menu component.
Why not just use the label instead of this alternative string? The problem is
internationalization. If you retarget this program to another language, you want to change
only the label in the menu, and not change the code (which would no doubt introduce new
errors). By using setActionCommand( ), the "action command" can be immutable, but the
menu label can change. All the code works with the "action command," so it's unaffected by
changes to the menu labels. Note that in this program, not all the menu components are
examined for their action commands, so those that aren't do not have their action command
set.

The bulk of the work happens in the listeners. BL performs the JMenuBar swapping. In
ML, the "figure out who rang" approach is taken by getting the source of the ActionEvent
and casting it to a JMenuItem, then getting the action command string to pass it through a
cascaded if statement.

The FL listener is simple even though it's handling all the different flavors in the flavor
menu. This approach is useful if you have enough simplicity in your logic, but in general,
you'll want to take the approach used with FooL, BarL, and BazL, in which each is attached
to only a single menu component, so no extra detection logic is necessary, and you know
exactly who called the listener. Even with the profusion of classes generated this way, the
code inside tends to be smaller, and the process is more foolproof.

You can see that menu code quickly gets long-winded and messy. This is another case where
the use of a GUI builder is the appropriate solution. A good tool will also handle the
maintenance of the menus.

Exercise 19: (3) Modify Menus.java to use radio buttons instead of check boxes on the
menus.


Exercise 20: (6) Create a program that breaks a text file into words. Distribute those
words as labels on menus and submenus.

### ‚òò Pop-up menus
The most straightforward way to implement a JPopupMenu is to create an inner class that
extends MouseAdapter, then add an object of that inner class to each component that you
want to produce pop-up behavior:

```java
//: gui/Popup.java
// Creating popup menus with Swing.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Popup extends JFrame {
    private JPopupMenu popup = new JPopupMenu();
    private JTextField t = new JTextField(10);
    public Popup() {
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(t);
        ActionListener al = new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                t.setText(((JMenuItem) e.getSource()).getText());
            }
        };
        JMenuItem m = new JMenuItem("Hither");
        m.addActionListener(al);
        popup.add(m);
        m = new JMenuItem("Yon");
        m.addActionListener(al);
        popup.add(m);
        m = new JMenuItem("Afar");
        m.addActionListener(al);
        popup.add(m);
        popup.addSeparator();
        m = new JMenuItem("Stay Here");
        m.addActionListener(al);
        popup.add(m);
        PopupListener pl = new PopupListener();
        addMouseListener(pl);
        t.addMouseListener(pl);
    }
    class PopupListener extends MouseAdapter {
        public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
            maybeShowPopup(e);
        }
        public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
            maybeShowPopup(e);
        }
        private void maybeShowPopup(MouseEvent e) {
            if (e.isPopupTrigger())
                popup.show(e.getComponent(), e.getX(), e.getY());
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Popup(), 300, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```

The same ActionListener is added to each JMenuItem. It fetches the text from the menu
label and inserts it into the JTextField.

### ‚òò Drawing
In a good GUI framework, drawing should be reasonably easy‚Äîand it is, in the Swing library.
The problem with any drawing example is that the calculations that determine where things
go are typically a lot more complicated than the calls to the drawing routines, and these
calculations are often mixed together with the drawing calls, so it can seem that the interface
is more complicated than it actually is.

For simplicity, consider the problem of representing data on the screenhere, the data will be
provided by the built-in Math.sin( ) method, which produces a mathematical sine function.
To make things a little more interesting, and to further demonstrate how easy it is to use
Swing components, a slider will be placed at the bottom of the form to dynamically control
the number of sine wave cycles that are displayed. In addition, if you resize the window,
you'll see that the sine wave refits itself to the new window size.

Although any JComponent may be painted and thus used as a canvas, if you just want a
straightforward drawing surface, you will typically inherit from a JPanel. The only method
you need to override is paintComponent( ), which is called whenever that component
must be repainted (you normally don't need to worry about this, because the decision is
managed by Swing). When it is called, Swing passes a Graphics object to the method, and
you can then use this object to draw or paint on the surface.

In the following example, all the intelligence concerning painting is in the SineDraw class;
the SineWave class simply configures the program and the slider control. Inside
SineDraw, the setCycles( ) method provides a hook to allow another object‚Äîthe slider
control, in this case‚Äîto control the number of cycles.

```java
//: gui/SineWave.java
// Drawing with Swing, using a JSlider.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.event.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

class SineDraw extends JPanel {
    private static final int SCALEFACTOR = 200;
    private int cycles;
    private int points;
    private double[] sines;
    private int[] pts;
    public SineDraw() { setCycles(5); }
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        int maxWidth = getWidth();
        double hstep = (double) maxWidth / (double) points;
        int maxHeight = getHeight();
        pts = new int[points];
        for (int i = 0; i < points; i++)
            pts[i] =
            (int)(sines[i] * maxHeight / 2 * .95 + maxHeight / 2);
        g.setColor(Color.RED);
        for (int i = 1; i < points; i++) {
            int x1 = (int)((i - 1) * hstep);
            int x2 = (int)(i * hstep);
            int y1 = pts[i - 1];
            int y2 = pts[i];
            g.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2);
        }
    }
    public void setCycles(int newCycles) {
        cycles = newCycles;
        points = SCALEFACTOR * cycles * 2;
        sines = new double[points];
        for (int i = 0; i < points; i++) {
            double radians = (Math.PI / SCALEFACTOR) * i;
            sines[i] = Math.sin(radians);
        }
        repaint();
    }
}

public class SineWave extends JFrame {
    private SineDraw sines = new SineDraw();
    private JSlider adjustCycles = new JSlider(1, 30, 5);
    public SineWave() {
        add(sines);
        adjustCycles.addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() {
            public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) {
                sines.setCycles(
                    ((JSlider) e.getSource()).getValue());
            }
        });
        add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, adjustCycles);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new SineWave(), 700, 400);
    }
} ///:~
```
All of the fields and arrays are used in the calculation of the sine wave points; cycles
indicates the number of complete sine waves desired, points contains the total number of
points that will be graphed, sines contains the sine function values, and pts contains the y-
coordinates of the points that will be drawn on the JPanel. The setCycles( ) method
creates the arrays according to the number of points needed and fills the sines array with
numbers. By calling repaint( ), setCycles( ) forces paintComponent( ) to be called so
the rest of the calculation and redraw will take place.

The first thing you must do when you override paintComponent( ) is to call the base-class
version of the method. Then you are free to do whatever you like; normally, this means using
the Graphics methods that you can find in the documentation for java.awt.Graphics (in
the JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com) to draw and paint pixels onto the
JPanel. Here, you can see that almost all the code is involved in performing the calculations;
the only two method calls that actually manipulate the screen are setColor( ) and
drawLine( ). You will probably have a similar experience when creating your own program
that displays graphical data; you'll spend most of your time figuring out what it is you want to
draw, but the actual drawing process will be quite simple.

When I created this program, the bulk of my time was spent in getting the sine wave to
display. Once I did that, I thought it would be nice to dynamically change the number of
cycles. My programming experiences when trying to do such things in other languages made
me a bit reluctant to try this, but it turned out to be the easiest part of the project. I created a
JSlider (the arguments are the leftmost value of the JSIider, the rightmost value, and the
starting value, respectively, but there are other constructors as well) and dropped it into the
JFrame. Then I looked at the JDK documentation and noticed that the only listener was the
addChangeListener, which was triggered whenever the slider was changed enough for it to
produce a different value. The only method for this was the obviously named
stateChanged( ), which provided a ChangeEvent object so that I could look backward to

the source of the change and find the new value. Calling the sines object's setCycles( )
enabled the new value to be incorporated and the JPanel to be redrawn.

In general, you will find that most of your Swing problems can be solved by following a
similar process, and you'll find that it's generally quite simple, even if you haven't used a
particular component before.

If your problem is more complex, there are other, more sophisticated alternatives for
drawing, including third-party JavaBeans components and the Java 2D API. These solutions
are beyond the scope of this book, but you should look them up if your drawing code becomes
too onerous.

Exercise 21: (5) Modify SineWave.java to turn SineDraw into a JavaBean by adding
"getter" and "setter" methods.

Exercise 22: (7) Create an application using SwingConsole. This should have three
sliders, one each for the red, green, and blue values in java.awt.Color. The rest of the form
should be a JPanel that displays the color determined by the three sliders. Also include non-
editable text fields that show the current RGB values.

Exercise 23: (8) Using SineWave.java as a starting point, create a program that
displays a rotating square on the screen. One slider should control the speed of rotation, and
a second slider should control the size of the box.

Exercise 24: (7) Remember the "sketching box" toy with two knobs, one that controls
the vertical movement of the drawing point, and one that controls the horizontal movement?
Create a variation of this toy, using SineWave.java to get you started. Instead of knobs, use
sliders. Add a button that will erase the entire sketch.

Exercise 25: (8) Starting with SineWave.java, create a program (an application using
the SwingConsole class) that draws an animated sine wave that appears to scroll past the
viewing window like an oscilloscope, driving the animation with a java.util.Timer. The
speed of the animation should be controlled with a javax.swing.JSlider control.

Exercise 26: (5) Modify the previous exercise so that multiple sine wave panels are
created within the application. The number of sine wave panels should be controlled by
command-line parameters.

Exercise 27: (5) Modify Exercise 25 so that the javax.swing.Timer class is used to
drive the animation. Note the difference between this and java.util.Timer.

Exercise 28: (7) Create a dice class (just a class, without a GUI). Create five dice and
throw them repeatedly. Draw the curve showing the sum of the dots from each throw, and
show the curve evolving dynamically as you throw more and more times.

### ‚òò Dialog boxes
A dialog box is a window that pops up out of another window. Its purpose is to deal with
some specific issue without cluttering the original window with those details. Dialog boxes
are commonly used in windowed programming environments.

To create a dialog box, you inherit from JDialog, which is just another kind of Window,
like a JFrame. A JDialog has a layout manager (which defaults to BorderLayout), and
you add event listeners to deal with events. Here's a very simple example:


```java
//: gui/Dialogs.java
// Creating and using Dialog Boxes.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

class MyDialog extends JDialog {
    public MyDialog(JFrame parent) {
        super(parent, "My dialog", true);
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(new JLabel("Here is my dialog"));
        JButton ok = new JButton("OK");
        ok.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                dispose(); // Closes the dialog
            }
        });
        add(ok);
        setSize(150, 125);
    }
}

public class Dialogs extends JFrame {
    private JButton b1 = new JButton("Dialog Box");
    private MyDialog dlg = new MyDialog(null);
    public Dialogs() {
        b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                dlg.setVisible(true);
            }
        });
        add(b1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Dialogs(), 125, 75);
    }
} ///:~
```
Once the JDialog is created, setVisible(true) must be called to display and activate it.
When the dialog window is closed, you must release the resources used by the dialog's
window by calling dispose( ).

The following example is more complex; the dialog box is made up of a grid (using
GridLayout) of a special kind of button that is defined here as class ToeButton. This
button draws a frame around itself and, depending on its state, a blank, an "x," or an "o" in
the middle. It starts out blank, and then depending on whose turn it is, changes to an "x" or
an "o." However, it will also flip back and forth between "x" and "o" when you click on the
button, to provide an interesting variation on the tic-tac-toe concept. In addition, the dialog
box can be set up for any number of rows and columns by changing numbers in the main
application window.

```java
//: gui/TicTacToe.java
// Dialog boxes and creating your own components.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class TicTacToe extends JFrame {
    private JTextField
    rows = new JTextField("3"),
    cols = new JTextField("3");
    private enum State { BLANK, XX, OO }
    static class ToeDialog extends JDialog {
        private State turn = State.XX; // Start with x's turn
        ToeDialog(int cellsWide, int cellsHigh) {
            setTitle("The game itself");
            setLayout(new GridLayout(cellsWide, cellsHigh));
            for (int i = 0; i < cellsWide * cellsHigh; i++)
                add(new ToeButton());
            setSize(cellsWide * 50, cellsHigh * 50);
            setDefaultCloseOperation(DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
        }
        class ToeButton extends JPanel {
            private State state = State.BLANK;
            public ToeButton() { addMouseListener(new ML()); }
            public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
                super.paintComponent(g);
                int
                x1 = 0, y1 = 0,
                    x2 = getSize().width - 1,
                    y2 = getSize().height - 1;
                g.drawRect(x1, y1, x2, y2);
                x1 = x2 / 4;
                y1 = y2 / 4;
                int wide = x2 / 2, high = y2 / 2;
                if (state == State.XX) {
                    g.drawLine(x1, y1, x1 + wide, y1 + high);
                    g.drawLine(x1, y1 + high, x1 + wide, y1);
                }
                if (state == State.OO)
                    g.drawOval(x1, y1, x1 + wide / 2, y1 + high / 2);
            }
            class ML extends MouseAdapter {
                public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                    if (state == State.BLANK) {
                        state = turn;
                        turn =
                            (turn == State.XX ? State.OO : State.XX);
                    } else
                        state =
                        (state == State.XX ? State.OO : State.XX);
                    repaint();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    class BL implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            JDialog d = new ToeDialog(
                new Integer(rows.getText()),
                new Integer(cols.getText()));
            d.setVisible(true);
        }
    }
    public TicTacToe() {
        JPanel p = new JPanel();
        p.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 2));
        p.add(new JLabel("Rows", JLabel.CENTER));
        p.add(rows);
        p.add(new JLabel("Columns", JLabel.CENTER));
        p.add(cols);
        add(p, BorderLayout.NORTH);
        JButton b = new JButton("go");
        b.addActionListener(new BL());
        add(b, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new TicTacToe(), 200, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```
Because statics can only be at the outer level of the class, inner classes cannot have static
data or nested classes.

The paintComponent( ) method draws the square around the panel and the "x" or the "o."
This is full of tedious calculations, but it's straightforward.

A mouse click is captured by the MouseListener, which first checks to see if the panel has
anything written on it. If not, the parent window is queried to find out whose turn it is, which
establishes the state of the ToeButton. Via the inner-class mechanism, the ToeButton
then reaches back into the parent and changes the turn. If the button is already displaying an
"x" or an "o," then that is flopped. You can see in these calculations the convenient use of the
ternary if-else described in the Operators chapter. After a state change, the ToeButton is
repainted.

The constructor for ToeDialog is quite simple: It adds into a GridLayout as many buttons
as you request, then resizes it for 50 pixels on a side for each button.

TicTacToe sets up the whole application by creating the JTextFields (for inputting the
rows and columns of the button grid) and the "go" button with its ActionListener. When
the button is pressed, the data in the JTextFields must be fetched, and, since they are in
String form, turned into ints using the Integer constructor that takes a String argument.

### ‚òò File dialogs
Some operating systems have a number of special built-in dialog boxes to handle the
selection of things such as fonts, colors, printers, and the like. Virtually all graphical
operating systems support the opening and saving of files, so Java's JFileChooser
encapsulates these for easy use.

The following application exercises two forms of JFileChooser dialogs, one for opening and
one for saving. Most of the code should by now be familiar, and all the interesting activities
happen in the action listeners for the two different button clicks:


```java
//: gui/FileChooserTest.java
// Demonstration of File dialog boxes.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class FileChooserTest extends JFrame {
    private JTextField
    fileName = new JTextField(),
        dir = new JTextField();
    private JButton
    open = new JButton("Open"),
        save = new JButton("Save");
    public FileChooserTest() {
        JPanel p = new JPanel();
        open.addActionListener(new OpenL());
        p.add(open);
        save.addActionListener(new SaveL());
        p.add(save);
        add(p, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
        dir.setEditable(false);
        fileName.setEditable(false);
        p = new JPanel();
        p.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 1));
        p.add(fileName);
        p.add(dir);
        add(p, BorderLayout.NORTH);
    }
    class OpenL implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            JFileChooser c = new JFileChooser();
            // Demonstrate "Open" dialog:
            int rVal = c.showOpenDialog(FileChooserTest.this);
            if (rVal == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {
                fileName.setText(c.getSelectedFile().getName());
                dir.setText(c.getCurrentDirectory().toString());
            }
            if (rVal == JFileChooser.CANCEL_OPTION) {
                fileName.setText("You pressed cancel");
                dir.setText("");
            }
        }
    }
    class SaveL implements ActionListener {
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            JFileChooser c = new JFileChooser();
            // Demonstrate "Save" dialog:
            int rVal = c.showSaveDialog(FileChooserTest.this);
            if (rVal == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {
                fileName.setText(c.getSelectedFile().getName());
                dir.setText(c.getCurrentDirectory().toString());
            }
            if (rVal == JFileChooser.CANCEL_OPTION) {
                fileName.setText("You pressed cancel");
                dir.setText("");
            }
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new FileChooserTest(), 250, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that there are many variations you can apply to JFileChooser, including filters to
narrow the file names that you will allow.

For an "open file" dialog, you call showOpenDialog( ), and for a "save file" dialog, you call
showSaveDialog( ). These commands don't return until the dialog is closed. The
JFileChooser object still exists, so you can read data from it. The methods
getSelectedFile( ) and getCurrentDirectory( ) are two ways you can interrogate the
results of the operation. If these return null, it means the user canceled out of the dialog.

Exercise 29: (3) In the JDK documentation for javax.swing, look up the
JColorChooser. Write a program with a button that brings up the color chooser as a dialog.


### ‚òò HTML on Swing components
Any component that can take text can also take HTML text, which it will reformat according
to HTML rules. This means you can very easily add fancy text to a Swing component. For
example:

```java
//: gui/HTMLButton.java
// Putting HTML text on Swing components.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class HTMLButton extends JFrame {
    private JButton b = new JButton(
        "<html><b><font size=+2>" +
        "<center>Hello!<br><i>Press me now!");
    public HTMLButton() {
        b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                add(new JLabel("<html>" +
                    "<i><font size=+4>Kapow!"));
                // Force a re-layout to include the new label:
                validate();
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new HTMLButton(), 200, 500);
    }
} ///:~
```
You must start the text with "<html>," and then you can use normal HTML tags. Note that
you are not forced to include the normal closing tags.

The ActionListener adds a new JLabel to the form, which also contains HTML text.
However, this label is not added during construction, so you must call the container's
validate( ) method in order to force a re-layout of the components (and thus the display of
the new label).

You can also use HTML text for JTabbedPane, JMenuItem, JToolTip, JRadioButton,
and JCheckBox.

Exercise 30: (3) Write a program that shows the use of HTML text on all the items from
the previous paragraph.

### ‚òò Sliders and progress bars
A slider (which has already been used in SineWave.java) allows the user to input data by
moving a point back and forth, which is intuitive in some situations (volume controls, for
example). A progress bar displays data in a relative fashion from "full" to "empty" so the user
gets a perspective. My favorite example for these is to simply hook the slider to the progress
bar so when you move the slider, the progress bar changes accordingly. The following
example also demonstrates the ProgressMonitor, a more fullfeatured pop-up dialog:

```java
//: gui/Progress.java
// Using sliders, progress bars and progress monitors.
import javax.swing.*;
import javax.swing.border.*;
import javax.swing.event.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class Progress extends JFrame {
    private JProgressBar pb = new JProgressBar();
    private ProgressMonitor pm = new ProgressMonitor(
        this, "Monitoring Progress", "Test", 0, 100);
    private JSlider sb =
        new JSlider(JSlider.HORIZONTAL, 0, 100, 60);
    public Progress() {
        setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 1));
        add(pb);
        pm.setProgress(0);
        pm.setMillisToPopup(1000);
        sb.setValue(0);
        sb.setPaintTicks(true);
        sb.setMajorTickSpacing(20);
        sb.setMinorTickSpacing(5);
        sb.setBorder(new TitledBorder("Slide Me"));
        pb.setModel(sb.getModel()); // Share model
        add(sb);
        sb.addChangeListener(new ChangeListener() {
            public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent e) {
                pm.setProgress(sb.getValue());
            }
        });
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new Progress(), 300, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```
The key to hooking the slider and progress bar components together is in sharing their
model, in the line:

    pb.setModel(sb.getModel());

Of course, you could also control the two using a listener, but using the model is more
straightforward for simple situations. The ProgressMonitor does not have a model and so
the listener approach is required. Note that the ProgressMonitor only moves forward, and
once it reaches the end it closes. The JProgressBar is fairly straightforward, but the
JSlider has a lot of options, such as the orientation and major and minor tick marks. Notice
how straightforward it is to add a titled border.

Exercise 31: (8) Create an "asymptotic progress indicator" that gets slower and slower as
it approaches the finish point. Add random erratic behavior so it will periodically look like it's
starting to speed up.

Exercise 32: (6) Modify Progress.java so that it does not share models, but instead
uses a listener to connect the slider and progress bar.

### ‚òò Selecting look & feel
"Pluggable look & feel" allows your program to emulate the look and feel of various operating
environments. You can even dynamically change the look and feel while the program is
executing. However, you generally just want to do one of two things: either select the "cross-
platform" look and feel (which is Swing's "metal"), or select the look and feel for the system
you are currently on so your Java program looks like it was created specifically for that
system (this is almost certainly the best choice in most cases, to avoid confounding the user).

The code to select either of these behaviors is quite simple, but you must execute it before
you create any visual components, because the components will be made based on the
current look and feel, and will not be changed just because you happen to change the look
and feel midway during the program (that process is more complicated and uncommon, and
is relegated to Swing-specific books).

Actually, if you want to use the cross-platform ("metal") look and feel that is characteristic of
Swing programs, you don't have to do anything‚Äîit's the default. But if you want instead to
use the current operating environment's look and feel, 8 you just insert the following code,
typically at the beginning of your main( ), but at least before any components are added:

```java
try {
    UIManager.setLookAndFeet(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```

You don't actually need anything in the catch clause because the UIManager will default to
the cross-platform look and feel if your attempts to set up any of the alternatives fail.
However, during debugging, the exception can be quite useful, so you may at least want to
see some results via the catch clause.

Here is a program that takes a command-line argument to select a look and feel, and shows
how several different components look under the chosen look and feel:

8 You may argue about whether the Swing rendering does justice to your operating environment.

```java
//: gui/LookAndFeel.java
// Selecting different looks & feels.
// {Args: motif}
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class LookAndFeel extends JFrame {
    private String[] choices =
        "Eeny Meeny Minnie Mickey Moe Larry Curly".split(" ");
    private Component[] samples = {
        new JButton("JButton"),
        new JTextField("JTextField"),
        new JLabel("JLabel"),
        new JCheckBox("JCheckBox"),
        new JRadioButton("Radio"),
        new JComboBox(choices),
        new JList(choices),
    };
    public LookAndFeel() {
        super("Look And Feel");
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        for (Component component: samples)
            add(component);
    }
    private static void usageError() {
        System.out.println(
            "Usage:LookAndFeel [cross|system|motif]");

        System.exit(1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 0) usageError();
        if (args[0].equals("cross")) {
            try {
                UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } else if (args[0].equals("system")) {
            try {
                UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } else if (args[0].equals("motif")) {
            try {
                UIManager.setLookAndFeel("com.sun.java." +
                    "swing.plaf.motif.MotifLookAndFeel");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } else usageError();
        // Note the look & feel must be set before
        // any components are created.
        run(new LookAndFeel(), 300, 300);
    }
} ///:~
```
You can see that one option is to explicitly specify a string for a look and feel, as seen with
MotifLookAndFeel. However, that one and the default "metal" look and feel are the only
ones that can legally be used on any platform; even though there are look-and-feel strings for
Windows and Macintosh, those can only be used on their respective platforms (these are
produced when you call getSystemLookAndFeelClassName( ) and you're on that
particular platform).

It is also possible to create a custom look and feel package, for example, if you are building a
framework for a company that wants a distinctive appearance. This is a big job and is far
beyond the scope of this book (in fact, you'll discover it is beyond the scope of many
dedicated Swing books!).

## üçÄ24.09 JNLP and Java Web Start
It's possible to sign an applet for security purposes. This is shown in the online supplement
for this chapter at www.MindView.net. Signed applets are powerful and can effectively take
the place of an application, but they must run inside a Web browser. This requires the extra
overhead of the browser running on the client machine, and also means that the user

interface of the applet is limited and often visually confusing. The Web browser has its own
set of menus and toolbars, which will appear above the applet. ‚Åπ

‚Åπ Jeremy Meyer developed this section.

The Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) solves the problem without sacrificing the
advantages of applets. With a JNLP application, you can download and install a standalone
Java application onto the client's machine. This can be run from the command prompt, a
desktop icon, or the application manager that is installed with your JNLP implementation.
The application can even be run from the Web site from which it was originally downloaded.
A JNLP application can dynamically download resources from the Internet at run time, and
can automatically check the version if the user is connected to the Internet. This means that
it has all of the advantages of an applet together with the advantages of standalone
applications.

Like applets, JNLP applications need to be treated with some caution by the client's system.
Because of this, JNLP applications are subject to the same sandbox security restrictions as
applets. Like applets, they can be deployed in signed JAR files, giving the user the option to
trust the signer. Unlike applets, if they are deployed in an unsigned JAR file, they can still
request access to certain resources of the client's system by means of services in the JNLP
API. The user must approve these requests during program execution.

JNLP describes a protocol, not an implementation, so you will need an implementation in
order to use it. Java Web Start, or JAWS, is Sun's freely available official reference
implementation and is distributed as part of Java SE5- If you are using it for development,
you must ensure that the JAR file (javaws.jar) is in your classpath; the easiest solution is to
add javaws.jar to your classpath from its normal Java installation path in jre/lib. If you are
deploying your JNLP application from a Web server, you must ensure that your server
recognizes the MIME type application/x-java-jnlp-file. If you are using a recent version
of the Tomcat server (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat) this is pre-configured. Consult the
user guide for your particular server.

Creating a JNLP application is not difficult. You create a standard application that is archived
in a JAR file, and then you provide a launch file, which is a simple XML file that gives the
client system all the information it needs to download and install your application. If you
choose not to sign your JAR file, then you must use the services supplied by the JNLP API for
each type of resource you want to access on the user's machine.

Here is a variation of FileChooserTest.java using the JNLP services to open the file
chooser, so that the class can be deployed as a JNLP application in an unsigned JAR file.

```java
//: gui/jnlp/JnlpFileChooser.java
// Opening files on a local machine with JNLP.
// {Requires: javax.jnlp.FileOpenService;
// You must have javaws.jar in your classpath}
// To create the jnlpfilechooser.jar file, do this:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JnlpFileChooser fc = new JnlpFileChooser();
        fc.setSize(400, 300);
        fc.setVisible(true);
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that the FileOpenService and the FileSaveService classes are imported from the
javax.jnlp package and that nowhere in the code is the JFileChooser dialog box referred
to directly. The two services used here must be requested using the
ServiceManager.lookup( ) method, and the resources on the client system can only be
accessed via the objects returned from this method. In this case, the files on the client's file
system are being written to and read from using the FileContent interface, provided by the
JNLP. Any attempt to access the resources directly by using, say, a File or a FileReader
object would cause a SecurityException to be thrown in the same way that it would if you
tried to use them from an unsigned applet. If you want to use these classes and not be
restricted to the JNLP service interfaces, you must sign the JAR file.

The commented jar command in JnlpFileChooser.java will produce the necessary JAR
file. Here is an appropriate launch file for the preceding example.

```xml
//:! gui/jnlp/filechooser.jnlp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jnlp spec="1.0+" codebase="file:C:/AAA-TIJ4/code/gui/jnlp" href="filechooser.jnlp">
    <information>
        <title>FileChooser demo application</title>
        <vendor>Mindview Inc.</vendor>
        <description>
            Jnlp File chooser Application
        </description>
        <description kind="short">
            Demonstrates opening, reading and writing a text file
        </description>
        <icon href="mindview.gif" />
        <offline-allowed />
    </information>
    <resources>
        <j2se version="1.3+" href="http://java.sun.com/products/autodl/j2se" />
        <jar href="jnlpfilechooser.jar" download="eager" />
    </resources>
    <application-desc main-class="gui.jnlp.JnlpFileChooser" />
</jnlp>
///:~
```

You'll find this launch file in the source-code download for this book (from
www.MindView.net) saved as filechooser.jnlp without the first and last lines, in the same
directory as the JAR file. As you can see, it is an XML file with one <jnlp> tag. This has a few
sub-elements, which are mostly selfexplanatory.

The spec attribute of the jnlp element tells the client system what version of the JNLP the
application can be run with. The codebase attribute points to the URL where this launch file
and the resources can be found. Here, it points to a directory on the local machine, which is a
good means of testing the application. Note that you'll need to change this path so that it
indicates the appropriate directory on your machine, in order for the program to load
successfully. The href attribute must specify the name of this file.

The information tag has various sub-elements that provide information about the
application. These are used by the Java Web Start administrative console or equivalent,
which installs the JNLP application and allows the user to run it from the command line,
make shortcuts, and so on.

The resources tag serves a similar purpose as the applet tag in an HTML file. The J2se sub-
element specifies the J2SE version required to run the application, and the jar sub-element
specifies the JAR file in which the class is archived. The jar element has an attribute
download, which can have the values "eager" or "lazy" that tell the JNLP implementation
whether or not the entire archive needs to be downloaded before the application can be run.
The application-desc attribute tells the JNLP implementation which class is the executable
class, or entry point, to the JAR file.

Another useful sub-element of the jnlp tag is the security tag, not shown here. Here's what
a security tag looks like:

<security>
<all-permissions/>
<security/>

You use the security tag when your application is deployed in a signed JAR file. It is not
needed in the preceding example because the local resources are all accessed via the JNLP
services.

There are a few other tags available, the details of which can be found in the specification at
http://java.sun.com/products/javawehstart/downloadspec. html.

To launch the program, you need a download page containing a hypertext link to the .jnlp
file. Here's what it looks like (without the first and last lines):

```xml
//:! gui/jnlp/filechooser.html
<html>
Follow the instructions in JnlpFileChooser.java to
build jnlpfilechooser.jar, then:
<a href="filechooser.jnlp">click here</a>
</html>
///:~
```
Once you have downloaded the application once, you can configure it by using the
administrative console. If you are using Java Web Start on Windows, then you will be
prompted to make a shortcut to your application the second time you use it. This behavior is
configurable.

Only two of the JNLP services are covered here, but there are seven services in the current
release. Each is designed for a specific task such as printing, or cutting and pasting to the
clipboard. You can find more information at http://java.sun.com.


## üçÄ24.10 Concurrency & Swing
When you program with Swing you're using threads. You saw this at the beginning of this
chapter when you learned that everything should be submitted to the Swing event dispatch
thread through SwingUtilities.invokeLater( ). However, the fact that you don't have to
explicitly create a Thread object means that threading issues can catch you by surprise. You
must keep in mind that there is a Swing event dispatch thread, which is always there,
handling all the Swing events by pulling each one out of the event queue and executing it in
turn. By remembering the event dispatch thread you'll help ensure that your application
won't suffer from deadlocking or race conditions.

This section addresses threading issues that arise when working with Swing.

### ‚òò Long-running tasks
One of the most fundamental mistakes you can make when programming with a graphical
user interface is to accidentally use the event dispatch thread to run a long task. Here's a
simple example:

```java
//: gui/LongRunningTask.java
// A badly designed program.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class LongRunningTask extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Start Long Running Task"),
        b2 = new JButton("End Long Running Task");
    public LongRunningTask() {
        b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
                try {
                    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Task interrupted");
                    return;
                }
                System.out.println("Task completed");
            }
        });
        b2.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
                // Interrupt yourself?
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new LongRunningTask(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```



When you press b1, the event dispatch thread is suddenly occupied in performing the long-
running task. You'll see that the button doesn't even pop back out, because the event dispatch
thread that would normally repaint the screen is busy. And you cannot do anything else, like
press b2, because the program won't respond until b1's task is complete and the event
dispatch thread is once again available. The code in b2 is a flawed attempt to solve the
problem by interrupting the event dispatch thread.

The answer, of course, is to execute long-running processes in separate threads. Here, the
single-thread Executor is used, which automatically queues pending tasks and executes
them one at a time:

```java
//: gui/InterruptableLongRunningTask.java
// Long-running tasks in threads.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private static int counter = 0;
    private final int id = counter++;
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(this + " started");
        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(this + " interrupted");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(this + " completed");
    }
    public String toString() { return "Task " + id; }
    public long id() { return id; }
};

public class InterruptableLongRunningTask extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Start Long Running Task"),
        b2 = new JButton("End Long Running Task");
    ExecutorService executor =
        Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    public InterruptableLongRunningTask() {
        b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                Task task = new Task();
                executor.execute(task);
                System.out.println(task + " added to the queue");
            }
        });
        b2.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                executor.shutdownNow(); // Heavy-handed
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new InterruptableLongRunningTask(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```

This is better, but when you press b2, it calls shutdownNow( ) on the ExecutorService,
thereby disabling it. If you try to add more tasks, you get an exception. Thus, pressing b2
makes the program inoperable. What we'd like to do is to shut down the current task (and
cancel pending tasks) without stopping everything. The Java SE5 Callable/Future
mechanism described in the Concurrency chapter is just what we need. We'll define a new
class called TaskManager, which contains tuples that hold the Callable representing the
task and the Future that comes back from the Callable. The reason the tuple is necessary is
because it allows us to keep track of the original task, so that we may get extra information
that is not available from the Future. Here it is:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/TaskItem.java
// A Future and the Callable that produced it.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TaskItem<R,C extends Callable<R>> {
    public final Future<R> future;
    public final C task;
    public TaskItem(Future<R> future, C task) {
        this.future = future;
        this.task = task;
    }
} ///:~
```
In the java.util.concurrent library, the task is not available via the Future by default
because the task would not necessarily still be around when you get the result from the
Future. Here, we force the task to stay around by storing it.

TaskManager is placed in net.mindview.util so it is available as a general-purpose
utility:

```java
//: net/mindview/util/TaskManager.java
// Managing and executing a queue of tasks.
package net.mindview.util;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TaskManager < R, C extends Callable < R >>
    extends ArrayList < TaskItem < R, C >> {
        private ExecutorService exec =
        Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        public void add(C task) {
            add(new TaskItem < R, C > (exec.submit(task), task));
        }
        public List < R > getResults() {
            Iterator < TaskItem < R, C >> items = iterator();
            List < R > results = new ArrayList < R > ();
            while (items.hasNext()) {
                TaskItem < R, C > item = items.next();
                if (item.future.isDone()) {
                    try {
                        results.add(item.future.get());
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        throw new RuntimeException(e);
                    }
                    items.remove();
                }
            }
            return results;

        }
        public List < String > purge() {
            Iterator < TaskItem < R, C >> items = iterator();
            List < String > results = new ArrayList < String > ();
            while (items.hasNext()) {
                TaskItem < R, C > item = items.next();
                // Leave completed tasks for results reporting:
                if (!item.future.isDone()) {
                    results.add("Cancelling " + item.task);
                    item.future.cancel(true); // May interrupt
                    items.remove();
                }
            }
            return results;
        }
    } ///:~
```
TaskManager is an ArrayList of Taskltem. It also contains a singlethread Executor, so
when you call add( ) with a Callable, it submits the Callable and stores the resulting
Future along with the original task. This way, if you need to do anything with the task, you
have a reference to that task. As a simple example, in purge( ) the task's toString( ) is
used.

This can now be used to manage the long-running tasks in our example:

```java
//: gui/InterruptableLongRunningCallable.java
// Using Callables for long-running tasks.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

class CallableTask extends Task
implements Callable < String > {
    public String call() {
        run();
        return "Return value of " + this;
    }
}

public class
InterruptableLongRunningCallable extends JFrame {
    private JButton
    b1 = new JButton("Start Long Running Task"),
        b2 = new JButton("End Long Running Task"),
        b3 = new JButton("Get results");
    private TaskManager < String, CallableTask > manager =
        new TaskManager < String, CallableTask > ();
    public InterruptableLongRunningCallable() {
        b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                CallableTask task = new CallableTask();
                manager.add(task);
                System.out.println(task + " added to the queue");
            }
        });
        b2.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                for (String result: manager.purge())
                    System.out.println(result);
            }
        });
        b3.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                // Sample call to a Task method:
                for (TaskItem < String, CallableTask > tt:
                    manager)
                    tt.task.id(); // No cast required
                for (String result: manager.getResults())
                    System.out.println(result);
            }
        });
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        add(b1);
        add(b2);
        add(b3);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        run(new InterruptableLongRunningCallable(), 200, 150);
    }
} ///:~
```
As you can see, CallableTask does exactly the same thing as Task except that it returns a
result‚Äîin this case a String identifying the task.

Non-Swing utilities (not part of the standard Java distribution) called SwingWorker (from
the Sun Web site) and Foxtrot (from http://foxtrot.sourceforge.net) were created to solve a
similar problem, but at this writing, those utilities had not been modified to take advantage
of the Java SE5 Callable/Future mechanism.

It's often important to give the end user some kind of visual cue that a task is running, and of
its progress. This is normally done through either a JProgressBar or a ProgressMonitor.

```
The MonitoredCallable constructor takes a ProgressMonitor as an argument, and its
call( ) method updates the ProgressMonitor every half second. Notice that a

MonitoredCallable is a separate task and thus should not try to control the UI directly, so
SwingUtilities.invokeLater( ) is used to submit the progress change information to the
monitor. Sun's Swing Tutorial (on http://java.sun.com) shows an alternate approach of
using a Swing Timer, which checks the status of the task and updates the monitor.
If the "cancel" button is pressed on the monitor, monitor.isCanceled( ) will return true.
Here, the task just calls interrupt ) on its own thread, which will land it in the catch clause
where the monitor is terminated with the close( ) method.

The rest of the code is effectively the same as before, except for the creation of the
ProgressMonitor as part of the MonitoredLongRunningCallable constructor.

Exercise 33: (6) Modify InterruptableLongRunningCallable.java so that it runs
all the tasks in parallel rather than sequentially.

### ‚òò Visual threading
The following example makes a Runnable JPanel class that paints different colors on
itself. This application is set up to take values from the command line to determine how big
the grid of colors is and how long to sleep( ) between color changes. By playing with these
values, you may discover some interesting and possibly inexplicable features in the threading
implementation on your platform:

```java
//: gui/ColorBoxes.java
// A visual demonstration of threading.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

class CBox extends JPanel implements Runnable {
    private int pause;
    private static Random rand = new Random();
    private Color color = new Color(0);
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        g.setColor(color);
        Dimension s = getSize();
        g.fillRect(0, 0, s.width, s.height);
    }
    public CBox(int pause) { this.pause = pause; }
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
                color = new Color(rand.nextInt(0xFFFFFF));
                repaint(); // Asynchronously request a paint()
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(pause);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Acceptable way to exit
        }
    }
}

public class ColorBoxes extends JFrame {
    private int grid = 12;
    private int pause = 50;
    private static ExecutorService exec =
        Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

    public void setUp() {
        setLayout(new GridLayout(grid, grid));
        for (int i = 0; i < grid * grid; i++) {
            CBox cb = new CBox(pause);
            add(cb);
            exec.execute(cb);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ColorBoxes boxes = new ColorBoxes();
        if (args.length > 0)
            boxes.grid = new Integer(args[0]);
        if (args.length > 1)
            boxes.pause = new Integer(args[1]);
        boxes.setUp();
        run(boxes, 500, 400);
    }
} ///:~
```
ColorBoxes configures a GridLayout so that it has grid cells in each dimension. Then it
adds the appropriate number of CBox objects to fill the grid, passing the pause value to
each one. In main( ) you can see how pause and grid have default values that can be
changed if you pass in command-line arguments.

CBox is where all the work takes place. This is inherited from JPanel and it implements the
Runnable interface so that each JPanel can also be an independent task. These tasks are
driven by a thread pool ExecutorService.

The current cell color is color. Colors are created using the Color constructor that takes a
24-bit number, which in this case is created randomly.

paintComponent( ) is quite simple; it just sets the color to color and fills the entire
JPanel with that color.

In run( ), you see the infinite loop that sets the color to a new random color and then calls
repaint( ) to show it. Then the thread goes to sleep( ) for the amount of time specified on
the command line.

The call to repaint( ) in run( ) deserves examination. At first glance, it may seem like we're
creating a lot of threads, each of which is forcing a paint. It might appear that this is violating
the principle that you should only submit tasks to the event queue. However, these threads
are not actually modifying the shared resource. When they call repaint( ), it doesn't force a
paint at that time, but only sets a "dirty flag" indicating that the next time the event dispatch
thread is ready to repaint things, this area is a candidate for repainting. Thus the program
doesn't cause Swing threading problems.

When the event dispatch thread actually does perform a paint( ), it first calls
paintComponent( ), then paintBorder( ) and paintChildren( ). If you need to override
paint( ) in a derived component, you must remember to call the base-class version of
paint( ) so that the proper actions are still performed.

Precisely because this design is flexible and threading is tied to each JPanel element, you
can experiment by making as many threads as you want. (In reality, there is a restriction
imposed by the number of threads your JVM can comfortably handle.)

This program also makes an interesting benchmark, since it can show dramatic performance
and behavioral differences between one JVM threading implementation and another, as well
as on different platforms.

Exercise 34: (4) Modify ColorBoxes.java so that it begins by sprinkling points ("stars")
across the canvas, then randomly changes the colors of those "stars."

## üçÄ24.11 Visual programming and JavaBeans
So far in this book you've seen how valuable Java is for creating reusable pieces of code. The
"most reusable" unit of code has been the class, since it comprises a cohesive unit of
characteristics (fields) and behaviors (methods) that can be reused either directly via
composition or through inheritance.

Inheritance and polymorphism are essential parts of object-oriented programming, but in
the majority of cases when you're putting together an application, what you really want is
components that do exactly what you need. You'd like to drop these parts into your design
like the chips an electronic engineer puts on a circuit board. It seems that there should be
some way to accelerate this "modular assembly" style of programming.

"Visual programming" first became successful‚Äîvery successful‚Äîwith Microsoft's Visual
BASIC (VB), followed by a second-generation design in Borland's Delphi (which was the
primary inspiration for the JavaBeans design). With these programming tools the
components are represented visually, which makes sense since they usually display some
kind of visual component such as a button or a text field. The visual representation, in fact, is
often exactly the way the component will look in the running program. So part of the process
of visual programming involves dragging a component from a palette and dropping it onto
your form. The Application Builder Integrated Development Environment (IDE) writes code
as you do this, and that code will cause the component to be created in the running program.

Simply dropping the component onto a form is usually not enough to complete the program.
Often, you must change the characteristics of a component, such as its color, the text that's
on it, the database it's connected to, etc. Characteristics that can be modified at design time
are referred to as properties. You can manipulate the properties of your component inside
the IDE, and when you create the program, this configuration data is saved so that it can be
rejuvenated when the program is started.

By now you're probably used to the idea that an object is more than characteristics; it's also a
set of behaviors. At design time, the behaviors of a visual component are partially
represented by events, meaning "Here's something that can happen to the component."
Ordinarily, you decide what you want to happen when an event occurs by tying code to that
event.

Here's the critical part: The IDE uses reflection to dynamically interrogate the component
and find out which properties and events the component supports. Once it knows what they
are, it can display the properties and allow you to change them (saving the state when you
build the program), and also display the events. In general, you do something like double-
clicking on an event, and the IDE creates a code body and ties it to that particular event. All
you must do at that point is write the code that executes when the event occurs.

All this adds up to a lot of work that's done for you by the IDE. As a result, you can focus on
what the program looks like and what it is supposed to do, and rely on the IDE to manage the
connection details for you. The reason that visual programming tools have been so successful
is that they dramatically speed up the process of building an application‚Äîcertainly the user
interface, but often other portions of the application as well.

### ‚òò What is a JavaBean?

After the dust settles, then, a component is really just a block of code, typically embodied in a
class. The key issue is the ability for the IDE to discover the properties and events for that
component. To create a VB component, the programmer originally had to write a fairly
complicated piece of code following certain conventions to expose the properties and events
(it got easier as the years passed). Delphi was a second-generation visual programming tool,
and the language was actively designed around visual programming, so it was much easier to
create a visual component. However, Java has brought the creation of visual components to
its most advanced state with JavaBeans, because a Bean is just a class. You don't have to
write any extra code or use special language extensions in order to make something a Bean.

The only thing you need to do, in fact, is slightly modify the way that you name your
methods. It is the method name that tells the IDE whether this is a property, an event, or just
an ordinary method.

In the JDK documentation, this naming convention is mistakenly termed a "design pattern."
This is unfortunate, since design patterns (see Thinking in Patterns at www.MindView.net)
are challenging enough without this sort of confusion. It's not a design pattern, it's just a
naming convention, and it's fairly simple:
1. For a property named xxx, you typically create two methods: getXxx( ) and setXxx(
). The first letter after "get" or "set" will automatically be lowercased by any tools that
look at the methods, in order to produce the property name. The type produced by the
"get" method is the same as the type of the argument to the "set" method. The name of
the property and the type for the "get" and "set" are not related.

2. For a boolean property, you can use the "get" and "set" approach above, but you can
also use "is" instead of "get."

3. Ordinary methods of the Bean don't conform to the above naming convention, but
they're public.

4. For events, you use the Swing "listener" approach. It's exactly the same as you've been
seeing: addBounceListener(BounceListener) and
removeBounceListener(BounceListener) to handle a BounceEvent. Most of
the time, the built-in events and listeners will satisfy your needs, but you can also
create your own events and listener interfaces.

We can use these guidelines to create a simple Bean:

```java
//: frogbean/Frog.java
// A trivial JavaBean.
package frogbean;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

class Spots {}

public class Frog {
    private int jumps;
    private Color color;
    private Spots spots;
    private boolean jmpr;
    public int getJumps() { return jumps; }
    public void setJumps(int newJumps) {
        jumps = newJumps;
    }
    public Color getColor() { return color; }
    public void setColor(Color newColor) {
        color = newColor;
    }
    public Spots getSpots() { return spots; }
    public void setSpots(Spots newSpots) {
        spots = newSpots;
    }
    public boolean isJumper() { return jmpr; }
    public void setJumper(boolean j) { jmpr = j; }
    public void addActionListener(ActionListener l) {
        //...
    }
    public void removeActionListener(ActionListener l) {
        // ...
    }
    public void addKeyListener(KeyListener l) {
        // ...
    }
    public void removeKeyListener(KeyListener l) {
        // ...
    }
    // An "ordinary" public method:
    public void croak() {
        System.out.println("Ribbet!");
    }
} ///:~
```
First, you can see that it's just a class. Usually, all your fields will be private and accessible
only through methods and properties. Following the naming convention, the properties are
jumps, color, spots, and jumper (notice the case change of the first letter in the property
name). Although the name of the internal identifier is the same as the name of the property
in the first three cases, in jumper you can see that the property name does not force you to
use any particular identifier for internal variables (or, indeed, to even have any internal
variables for that property).

The events this Bean handles are ActionEvent and KeyEvent, based on the naming of the
"add" and "remove" methods for the associated listener. Finally, you can see that the
ordinary method croak( ) is still part of the Bean simply because it's a public method, not
because it conforms to any naming scheme.

### ‚òò Extracting Beanlnfo with the Introspector
One of the most critical parts of the JavaBean scheme occurs when you drag a Bean off a
palette and drop it onto a form. The IDE must be able to create the Bean (which it can do if
there's a default constructor) and then, without access to the Bean's source code, extract all
the necessary information to create the property sheet and event handlers.

Part of the solution is already evident from the Type Information chapter: Java reflection
discovers all the methods of an unknown class. This is perfect for solving the JavaBean
problem without requiring extra language keywords like those in other visual programming
languages. In fact, one of the prime reasons that reflection was added to Java was to support
JavaBeans (although reflection also supports object serialization and Remote Method
Invocation, and is helpful in ordinary programming). So you might expect that the creator of
the IDE would have to reflect each Bean and hunt through its methods to find the properties
and events for that Bean.

This is certainly possible, but the Java designers wanted to provide a standard tool, not only
to make Beans simpler to use, but also to provide a standard gateway to the creation of more
complex Beans. This tool is the Introspector class, and the most important method in this
class is the static getBeanInfo( ). You pass a Class reference to this method, and it fully

interrogates that class and returns a BeanInfo object which you can dissect to find
properties, methods, and events.

Usually, you won't care about any of this; you'll probably get most of your Beans off the shelf,
and you won't need to know all the magic that's going on underneath. You'll simply drag
Beans onto your form, then configure their properties and write handlers for the events of
interest. However, it's an educational exercise to use the Introspector to display
information about a Bean. Here's a tool that does it:

        results.setText("");
        BeanInfo bi = null;
        try {
            bi = Introspector.getBeanInfo(bean, Object.class);
        } catch (IntrospectionException e) {
            print("Couldn't introspect " + bean.getName());
            return;
        }
        for (PropertyDescriptor d: bi.getPropertyDescriptors()) {
            Class < ? > p = d.getPropertyType();

            print("====================");
        }

```
BeanDumper.dump( ) does all the work. First it tries to create a BeanInfo object, and if
successful, calls the methods of BeanInfo that produce information about properties,
methods, and events. In Introspector.getBeanInfo( ), you'll see there is a second
argument that tells the Introspector where to stop in the inheritance hierarchy. Here, it
stops before it parses all the methods from Object, since we're not interested in seeing those.
For properties, getPropertyDescriptors( ) returns an array of PropertyDescriptors.

For each PropertyDescriptor, you can call getPropertyType( ) to find the class of object
that is passed in and out via the property methods. Then, for each property, you can get its
pseudonym (extracted from the method names) with getName( ), the method for reading
with getReadMethod( ), and the method for writing with getWriteMethod( ). These last
two methods return a Method object that can actually be used to invoke the corresponding
method on the object (this is part of reflection).

For the public methods (including the property methods), getMethodDescriptors( )
returns an array of MethodDescriptors. For each one, you can get the associated Method
object and print its name.

For the events, getEventSetDescriptors( ) returns an array of EventSetDescriptors.

Each of these can be queried to find out the class of the listener, the methods of that listener
class, and the add- and removelistener methods. The BeanDumper program displays all of
this information.

Upon startup, the program forces the evaluation of frogbean.Frog. The output, after
unnecessary details have been removed, is:

    public void removeKeyListener(KeyListener)
    ====================
    Listener type:
    ActionListener
    Listener method:
    actionPerformed
    Method descriptor:
    public abstract void actionPerformed(ActionEvent)
    Add Listener Method:
    public void addActionListener(ActionListener)
    Remove Listener Method:
    public void removeActionListener(ActionListener)
    ====================

This reveals most of what the Introspector sees as it produces a BeanInfo object from
your Bean. You can see that the type of the property and its name are independent. Notice
the lowercasing of the property name. (The only time this doesn't occur is when the property
name begins with more than one capital letter in a row.) And remember that the method
names you're seeing here (such as the read and write methods) are actually produced from a
Method object that can be used to invoke the associated method on the object.

The public method list includes the methods that are not associated with a property or an
event, such as croak( ), as well as those that are. These are all the methods that you can call
programmatically for a Bean, and the IDE can choose to list all of these while you're making
method calls, to ease your task.

Finally, you can see that the events are fully parsed out into the listener, its methods, and the
add- and remove-listener methods. Basically, once you have the BeanInfo, you can find out
everything of importance for the Bean. You can also call the methods for that Bean, even
though you don't have any other information except the object (again, a feature of reflection).

### ‚òò A more sophisticated Bean
This next example is slightly more sophisticated, albeit frivolous. It's a JPanel that draws a
little circle around the mouse whenever the mouse is moved. When you press the mouse, the
word "Bang!" appears in the middle of the screen, and an action listener is fired.

The properties you can change are the size of the circle as well as the color, size, and text of
the word that is displayed when you press the mouse. A BangBean also has its own
addActionListener( ) and removeActionListener( ), so you can attach your own
listener that will be fired when the user clicks on the BangBean. You should recognize the
property and event support:

```java
//: bangbean/BangBean.java
// A graphical Bean.
package bangbean;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class
BangBean extends JPanel implements Serializable {

private int xm, ym;
private int cSize = 20; // Circle size
private String text = "Bang!";
private int fontSize = 48;
private Color tColor = Color.RED;
private ActionListener actionListener;
public BangBean() {
addMouseListener(new ML());
addMouseMotionListener(new MML());
}
public int getCircleSize() { return cSize; }
public void setCircleSize(int newSize) {
cSize = newSize;
}
public String getBangText() { return text; }
public void setBangText(String newText) {
text = newText;
}
public int getFontSize() { return fontSize; }
public void setFontSize(int newSize) {
fontSize = newSize;
}
public Color getTextColor() { return tColor; }
public void setTextColor(Color newColor) {
tColor = newColor;
}
public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
super.paintComponent(g);
g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
g.drawOval(xm - cSize/2, ym - cSize/2, cSize, cSize);
}
// This is a unicast listener, which is
// the simplest form of listener management:
public void addActionListener(ActionListener l)
throws TooManyListenersException {
if(actionListener != null)
throw new TooManyListenersException();
actionListener = l;
}
public void removeActionListener(ActionListener l) {
actionListener = null;
}
class ML extends MouseAdapter {
public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
Graphics g = getGraphics();
g.setColor(tColor);
g.setFont(
new Font("TimesRoman", Font.BOLD, fontSize));
int width = g.getFontMetrics().stringWidth(text);
g.drawString(text, (getSize().width - width) /2,
getSize().height/2);
g.dispose();
// Call the listener's method:
if(actionListener != null)
actionListener.actionPerformed(
new ActionEvent(BangBean.this,
ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, null));
}
}
class MML extends MouseMotionAdapter {
public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e) {
xm = e.getX();
ym = e.getY();

repaint();
}
}
public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
return new Dimension(200, 200);
}
} ///:~
```
The first thing you'll notice is that BangBean implements the Serializable interface. This
means that the IDE can "pickle" all the information for the BangBean by using serialization
after the program designer has adjusted the values of the properties. When the Bean is
created as part of the running application, these "pickled" properties are restored so that you
get exactly what you designed.

When you look at the signature for addActionListener( ), you'll see that it can throw a
TooManyListenersException. This indicates that it is unicast, which means it notifies
only one listener when the event occurs. Ordinarily, you'll use multicast events so that many
listeners can be notified of an event. However, that runs into threading issues, so it will be
revisited in the next section, "JavaBeans and synchronization." In the meantime, a unicast
event sidesteps the problem.

When you click the mouse, the text is put in the middle of the BangBean, and if the
actionListener field is not null, its actionPerformed( ) is called, creating a new
ActionEvent object in the process. Whenever the mouse is moved, its new coordinates are
captured and the canvas is repainted (erasing any text that's on the canvas, as you'll see).
Here is the BangBeanTest class to test the Bean:

```java
//: bangbean/BangBeanTest.java
// {Timeout: 5} Abort after 5 seconds when testing
package bangbean;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class BangBeanTest extends JFrame {
private JTextField txt = new JTextField(20);
// During testing, report actions:
class BBL implements ActionListener {
private int count = 0;
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
txt.setText("BangBean action "+ count++);
}
}
public BangBeanTest() {
BangBean bb = new BangBean();
try {
bb.addActionListener(new BBL());
} catch(TooManyListenersException e) {
txt.setText("Too many listeners");
}
add(bb);
add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, txt);
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
run(new BangBeanTest(), 400, 500);
}
} ///:~
```

When a Bean is used in an IDE, this class will not be used, but it's helpful to provide a rapid
testing method for each of your Beans. BangBeanTest places a BangBean within the
JFrame, attaching a simple ActionListener to the BangBean to print an event count to
the JTextField whenever an ActionEvent occurs. Usually, of course, the IDE would create
most of the code that uses the Bean.

When you run the BangBean through BeanDumper or put the BangBean inside a Bean-
enabled development environment, you'll notice that there are many more properties and
actions than are evident from the preceding code. That's because BangBean is inherited
from JPanel, and JPanel is also a Bean, so you're seeing its properties and events as well.

Exercise 35: (6) Locate and download one or more of the free GUI builder development
environments available on the Internet, or use a commercial product if you own one.
Discover what is necessary to add BangBean to this environment and to use it.

### ‚òò JavaBeans and synchronization
Whenever you create a Bean, you must assume that it will run in a multithreaded
environment. This means that:
1. Whenever possible, all the public methods of a Bean should be synchronized. Of
course, this incurs the synchronized runtime overhead (which has been significantly
reduced in recent versions of the JDK). If that's a problem, methods that will not
cause problems in critical sections can be left unsynchronized, but keep in mind
that such methods are not always obvious. Methods that qualify tend to be small (such
as getCircleSize( ) in the following example) and/or "atomic"; that is, the method
call executes in such a short amount of code that the object cannot be changed during
execution (but review the Concurrency chapter‚Äî what you may think is atomic might
not be). Making such methods unsynchronized might not have a significant effect
on the execution speed of your program. You're better off making all public methods
of a Bean synchronized and removing the synchronized keyword on a method only
when you know for sure that it makes a difference and that you can safely remove the
keyword.

2. When firing a multicast event to a bunch of listeners interested in that event, you must
assume that listeners might be added or removed while moving through the list.

The first point is fairly straightforward, but the second point requires a little more thought.
BangBean.java ducked out of the concurrency question by ignoring the synchronized
keyword and making the event unicast. Here is a modified version that works in a
multithreaded environment and uses multicasting for events:

```java
//: gui/BangBean2.java
// You should write your Beans this way so they
// can run in a multithreaded environment.
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import static net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.*;

public class BangBean2 extends JPanel

    private ArrayList < ActionListener > actionListeners =
        new ArrayList < ActionListener > ();

        addMouseListener(new ML());

    // used than the unicast approach taken in BangBean.java:

    }
    public synchronized void
    removeActionListener(ActionListener l) {
        actionListeners.remove(l);
    }
    // Notice this isn't synchronized:

        }
        // Call all the listener methods:

            al.actionPerformed(a);
    }

} ///:~
```
Adding synchronized to the methods is an easy change. However, notice in
addActionListener( ) and removeActionListener( ) that the ActionListeners are
now added to and removed from an ArrayList, so you can have as many as you want.
You can see that the method notifyListeners( ) is not synchronized. It can be called from
more than one thread at a time. It's also possible for addActionListener( ) or
removeActionListener( ) to be called in the middle of a call to notifyListeners( ),
which is a problem because it traverses the ArrayList actionListeners. To alleviate the
problem, the ArrayList is duplicated inside a synchronized clause, using the ArrayList
constructor which copies the elements of its argument, and the duplicate is traversed. This
way, the original ArrayList can be manipulated without impact on notifyListeners( ).

The paintComponent( ) method is also not synchronized. Deciding whether to
synchronize overridden methods is not as clear as when you're just adding your own
methods. In this example, it turns out that paintComponent( ) seems to work OK whether
it's synchronized or not. But the issues you must consider are:
1. Does the method modify the state of "critical" variables within the object? To discover
whether the variables are "critical," you must determine whether they will be read or
set by other threads in the program. (In this case, the reading or setting is virtually
always accomplished via synchronized methods, so you can just examine those.) In
the case of paintComponent( ), no modification takes place.

2. Does the method depend on the state of these "critical" variables? If a synchronized
method modifies a variable that your method uses, then you might very well want to
make your method synchronized as well. Based on this, you might observe that
cSize is changed by synchronized methods, and therefore paintComponent( )

should be synchronized. Here, however, you can ask, "What's the worst thing that
will happen if cSize is changed during a paintComponent( )?" When you see that
it's nothing too bad, and a transient effect at that, you can decide to leave
paintComponent( ) unsynchronized to prevent the extra overhead from the
synchronized method call.

3. A third clue is to notice whether the base-class version of paintComponent( ) is
synchronized, which it isn't. This isn't an airtight argument, just a clue. In this case,
for example, a field that is changed via synchronized methods (that is, cSize) has
been mixed into the paintComponent( ) formula and might have changed the
situation. Notice, however, that synchronized doesn't inherit; that is, if a method is
synchronized in the base class, then it is not automatically synchronized in the
derivedclass overridden version.

4. paint( ) and paintComponent( ) are methods that must be as fast as possible.
Anything that takes processing overhead out of these methods is highly
recommended, so if you think you need to synchronize these methods it may be an
indicator of bad design.

The test code in main( ) has been modified from that seen in BangBeanTest to
demonstrate the multicast ability of BangBean2 by adding extra listeners.

### ‚òò Packaging a Bean
Before you can bring a JavaBean into a Bean-enabled IDE, it must be put into a Bean
container, which is a JAR file that includes all the Bean classes as well as a "manifest" file
that says, "This is a Bean." A manifest file is simply a text file that follows a particular form.
For the BangBean, the manifest file looks like this:

    Manifest-Version: 1.0

    Name: bangbean/BangBean.class
    Java-Bean: True

The first line indicates the version of the manifest scheme, which until further notice from
Sun is 1.0. The second line (empty lines are ignored) names the BangBean.class file, and
the third says, "It's a Bean." Without the third line, the program builder tool will not
recognize the class as a Bean.

The only tricky part is that you must make sure that you get the proper path in the "Name:"
field. If you look back at BangBean.java, you'll see it's in package bangbean (and thus in
a subdirectory called bangbean that's off of the classpath), and the name in the manifest file
must include this package information. In addition, you must place the manifest file in the
directory above the root of your package path, which in this case means placing the file in the
directory above the "bangbean" subdirectory. Then you must invoke jar from the same
directory as the manifest file, as follows:

    jar cfm BangBean.jar BangBean.mf bangbean

This assumes that you want the resulting JAR file to be named BangBean.jar, and that
you've put the manifest in a file called BangBean.mf.

You might wonder, "What about all the other classes that were generated when I compiled
BangBean.java?" Well, they all ended up inside the bangbean subdirectory, and you'll see
that the last argument for the above jar command line is the bangbean subdirectory. When
you give jar the name of a subdirectory, it packages that entire subdirectory into the JAR file
(including, in this case, the original BangBean.java source-code file‚Äîyou might not choose

to include the source with your own Beans). In addition, if you turn around and unpack the
JAR file you've just created, you'll discover that your manifest file isn't inside, but that jar
has created its own manifest file (based partly on yours) called MANIFEST.MF and placed
it inside the subdirectory META-INF (for "meta-information"). If you open this manifest
file, you'll also notice that digital signature information has been added by jar for each file, of
the form:

    Digest-Algorithms: SHA MD5
    SHA-Digest: pDpEAG9NaeCx8aFtqPI4udSX/O0=
    MD5-Digest: 04NcSlhE3Smnzlp2hj6qeg==

In general, you don't need to worry about any of this, and if you make changes, you can just
modify your original manifest file and reinvoke jar to create a new JAR file for your Bean.
You can also add other Beans to the JAR file simply by adding their information to your
manifest.

One thing to notice is that you'll probably want to put each Bean in its own subdirectory,
since when you create a JAR file you hand the jar utility the name of a subdirectory, and it
puts everything in that subdirectory into the JAR file. You can see that both Frog and
BangBean are in their own subdirectories.

Once you have your Bean properly inside a JAR file, you can bring it into a Beans-enabled
IDE. The way you do this varies from one tool to the next, but Sun provides a freely available
test bed for JavaBeans in its "Bean Builder." (Download from http://java.sun.com/beans.)
You place a Bean into the Bean Builder by simply copying the JAR file into the correct
subdirectory.

Exercise 36: (4) Add Frog.class to the manifest file in this section and run jar to
create a JAR file containing both Frog and BangBean. Now either download and install the
Bean Builder from Sun, or use your own Beans-enabled program builder tool and add the
JAR file to your environment so you can test the two Beans.

Exercise 37: (5) Create your own JavaBean called Valve that contains two properties: a
boolean called "on" and an int called "level." Create a manifest file, use jar to package your
Bean, then load it into the Bean Builder or into a Beans-enabled program builder tool so that
you can test it.

### ‚òò More complex Bean support
You can see how remarkably simple it is to make a Bean, but you aren't limited to what
you've seen here. The JavaBeans architecture provides a simple point of entry but can also
scale to more complex situations. These situations are beyond the scope of this book, but they
will be briefly introduced here. You can find more details at http://java.sun.com/beans.
One place where you can add sophistication is with properties. The examples you've seen
here have shown only single properties, but it's also possible to represent multiple properties
in an array. This is called an indexed property. You simply provide the appropriate methods
(again following a naming convention for the method names), and the Introspector
recognizes an indexed property so that your IDE can respond appropriately.

Properties can be bound, which means that they will notify other objects via a
PropertyChangeEvent. The other objects can then choose to change themselves based on
the change to the Bean.

Properties can be constrained, which means that other objects can veto a change to that
property if it is unacceptable. The other objects are notified by using a

PropertyChangeEvent, and they can throw a PropertyVetoException to prevent the
change from happening and to restore the old values.

You can also change the way your Bean is represented at design time:
1. You can provide a custom property sheet for your particular Bean. The ordinary
property sheet will be used for all other Beans, but yours is automatically invoked
when your Bean is selected.

2. You can create a custom editor for a particular property, so the ordinary property
sheet is used, but when your special property is being edited, your editor will
automatically be invoked.

3. You can provide a custom BeanInfo class for your Bean that produces information
different from the default created by the Introspector.

4. It's also possible to turn "expert" mode on and off in all FeatureDescriptors to
distinguish between basic features and more complicated ones.

### ‚òò More to Beans
There are a number of books about JavaBeans; for example, JavaBeans by Elliotte Rusty
Harold (IDG, 1998).

Alternatives to Swing
Although the Swing library is the GUI sanctioned by Sun, it is by no means the only way to
create graphical user interfaces. Two important alternatives are Macromedia Flash, using
Macromedia's Flex programming system, for client-side GUIs over the Web, and the open-
source Eclipse Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) library for desktop applications.

Why would you consider alternatives? For Web clients, you can make a fairly strong
argument that applets have failed. Considering how long they've been around (since the
beginning) and the initial hype and promise around applets, coming across a Web
application that uses applets is still a surprise. Even Sun doesn't use applets everywhere.

Here's an example:
http://java.sun.c0m/developer/onlineTraining/new2java/javamap/intro.html
An interactive map of Java features on the Sun site seems a very likely candidate for a Java
applet, and yet they did it in Flash. This appears to be a tacit acknowledgement that applets
have not been a success. More importantly, the Flash Player is installed on upwards of 98
percent of computing platforms, so it can be considered an accepted standard. As you'll see,
the Flex system provides a very powerful client-side programming environment, certainly
more powerful than JavaScript and with a look and feel that is often preferable to an applet.
If you want to use applets, you must still convince the client to download the JRE, whereas
the Flash Player is small and fast to download by comparison.

For desktop applications, one problem with Swing is that users notice that they are using a
different kind of application, because the look and feel of Swing applications is different from
the normal desktop. Users are not generally interested in new looks and feels in an
application; they are trying to get work done and prefer that an application look and feel like
all their other applications. SWT creates applications that look like native applications, and
because the library uses native components as much as possible, the applications tend to run
faster than equivalent Swing applications.


## üçÄ24.12 Building Flash Web clients with Flex
Because the lightweight Macromedia Flash virtual machine is so ubiquitous, most people will
be able to use a Flash-based interface without installing anything, and it will look and behave
the same way across all systems and platforms. ¬π‚Å∞

¬π‚Å∞ Sean Neville created the core of the material in this section.

With Macromedia Flex, you can develop Flash user interfaces for Java applications. Flex
consists of an XML- and script-based programming model, similar to programming models
such as HTML and JavaScript, along with a robust library of components. You use the
MXML syntax to declare layout management and widget controls, and you use dynamic
scripting to add event-handling and service invocation code which links the user interface to
Java classes, data models, Web services, etc. The Flex compiler takes your MXML and script
files and compiles them into bytecode. The Flash virtual machine on the client operates like
the Java Virtual Machine in that it interprets compiled bytecode. The Flash bytecode format
is known as SWF, and SWF files are produced by the Flex compiler.

Note that there's an open-source alternative to Flex at http://openlaszlo.org; this has a
structure that's similar to Flex but may be a preferable alternative for some. Other tools also
exist to create Flash applications in different ways.

Hello, Flex
Consider this MXML code, which defines a user interface (note that the first and last lines
will not appear in the code that you download as part of this book's source-code package):

```xml
//:! gui/flex/helloflex1.mxml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application
xmlns:mx="http://www.macromedia.com/2003/mxml"
backgroundColor="#ffffff">
<mx:Label id="output" text="Hello, Flex!" />
</mx:Application>
///:~
```
MXML files are XML documents, so they begin with an XML version/encoding directive. The
outermost MXML element is the Application element, which is the topmost visual and
logical container for a Flex user interface. You can declare tags representing visual controls,
such as the Label element above, inside the Application element. Controls are always
placed within a container, and containers encapsulate layout managers, among other
mechanisms, so they manage the layout of the controls within them. In the simplest case, as
in the above example, the Application acts as the container. The Application's default
layout manager merely places controls vertically down the interface in the order in which
they are declared.

ActionScript is a version of ECMAScript, or JavaScript, which looks quite similar to Java and
supports classes and strong typing in addition to dynamic scripting. By adding a script to the
example, we can introduce behavior. Here, the MXML Script control is used to place
ActionScript directly into the MXML file:

```xml
//:! gui/flex/helloflex2.mxml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mx:Application
xmlns:mx="http://www.macromedia.com/2003/mxml"
backgroundColor="#ffffff">
    <mx:Script>
    <![CDATA[
    function updateOutput() {
    output.text = "Hello! " + input.text;
    }
    ]]>
    </mx:Script>
    <mx:TextInput id="input" width="200" change="updateOutput()" />
    <mx:Label id="output" text="Hello!" />
</mx:Application>
///:~
```
A TextInput control accepts user input, and a Label displays the data as it is being typed.
Note that the id attribute of each control becomes accessible in the script as a variable name,
so the script can reference instances of the MXML tags. In the TextInput field, you can see
that the change attribute is connected to the updateOutput( ) function so that the
function is called whenever any kind of change occurs.

### ‚òò Compiling MXML
The easiest way to get started using Flex is with the free trial, which you can download at
www.macromedia.com/software/flex/trial . 11 The product is packaged in a number of
editions, from free trials to enterprise server versions, and Macromedia offers additional
tools for developing Flex applications. Exact packaging is subject to change, so check the
Macromedia site for specifics. Also note that you may need to modify the jvm.config file in
the Flex installation bin directory.

To compile the MXML code into Flash bytecode, you have two options:
1. You can place the MXML file in a Java Web application, alongside JSP and HTML
pages in a WAR file, and have requests for the .mxml file compiled at run time
whenever a browser requests the MXML document's URL.

2. You can compile the MXML file using the Flex command-line compiler, mxmlc.

The first option, Web-based runtime compilation, requires a servlet container (such as
Apache Tomcat) in addition to Flex. The servlet container's WAR file(s) must be updated
with Flex configuration information, such as servlet mappings which are added to the
web.xml descriptor, and it must include the Flex JAR files‚Äîthese steps are handled
automatically when you install Flex. After the WAR file is configured, you can place the
MXML files in the Web application and request the document's URL through any browser.
Flex will compile the application upon the first request, similar to the JSP model, and will
thereafter deliver the compiled and cached SWF within an HTML shell.

The second option does not require a server. When you invoke the Flex mxmlc compiler on
the command line, you produce SWF files. You can deploy these as you desire. The mxmlc
executable is located in the bin directory of a Flex installation, and invoking it with no
arguments will provide a list of valid command-line options. Typically, you'll specify the
location of the Flex client component library as the value of the -flexlib command-line
option, but in very simple examples like the two that we've seen so far, the Flex compiler will
assume the location of the component library. So you can compile the first two examples like
this:

11 Note that you must download Flex, and not FlexBuilder. The latter is an IDE design tool.

    mxmlc.exe helloflexl.mxml
    mxmlc.exe helloflex2.mxml

This produces a helloflex2.swf file which can be run in Flash, or placed alongside HTML
on any HTTP server (once Flash has been loaded into your Web browser, you can often just
double-click on the SWF file to start it up in the browser).

For helloflex2.swf, you'll see the following user interface running in the Flash Player:

    This was not too hard to do‚Ä¶|
    Hello! This was not too hard to do‚Ä¶

In more complex applications, you can separate MXML and ActionScript by referencing
functions in external ActionScript files. From MXML, you use the following syntax for the
Script control:

<mx:Script source="MyExternalScript.as" />

This code allows the MXML controls to reference functions located in a file named
MyExternalScript.as as if they were located within the MXML file.

### ‚òò MXML and ActionScript
MXML is declarative shorthand for ActionScript classes. Whenever you see an MXML tag,
there exists an ActionScript class of the same name. When the Flex compiler parses MXML,
it first transforms the XML into ActionScript and loads the referenced ActionScript classes,
and then compiles and links the ActionScript into an SWF.

You can write an entire Flex application in ActionScript alone, without using any MXML.
Thus, MXML is a convenience. User interface components such as containers and controls
are typically declared using MXML, while logic such as event handling and other client logic
is handled through ActionScript and Java.

You can create your own MXML controls and reference them using MXML by writing
ActionScript classes. You may also combine existing MXML containers and controls in a new
MXML document that can then be referenced as a tag in another MXML document. The
Macromedia Web site contains more information about how to do this.

### ‚òò Containers and controls
The visual core of the Flex component library is a set of containers which manage layout, and
an array of controls which go inside those containers. Containers include panels, vertical and
horizontal boxes, tiles, accordions, divided boxes, grids, and more. Controls are user
interface widgets such as buttons, text areas, sliders, calendars, data grids, and so forth.
The remainder of this section will show a Flex application that displays and sorts a list of
audio files. This application demonstrates containers, controls, and how to connect to Java
from Flash.

We start the MXML file by placing a DataGrid control (one of the more sophisticated Flex
controls) within a Panel container:

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

    </mx:RemoteObject>
</mx:Application>
///:~
```

The DataGrid contains nested tags for its array of columns. When you see an attribute or a
nested element on a control, you know that it corresponds to some property, event, or
encapsulated object in the underlying ActionScript class. The DataGrid has an id attribute
with the value songGrid, so ActionScript and MXML tags can reference the grid
programmatically by using songGrid as a variable name. The DataGrid exposes many
more properties than those shown here; the complete API for MXML controls and containers
can be found online at http ://livedocs. macromedia. com/flex/is/asdocs_ en/index.html.
The DataGrid is followed by a VBox containing an Image to show the front of the album
along with song information, and a MediaPlayback control that will play MP3 files. This
example streams the content in order to reduce the size of the compiled SWF. When you
embed images, audio, and video files into a Flex application instead of streaming them, the
files become part of the compiled SWF and are delivered along with your user interface assets
instead of streamed on demand at run time.

The Flash Player contains embedded codecs for playing and streaming audio and video in a
variety of formats. Flash and Flex support the use of the Web's most common image formats,
and Flex also has the ability to translate scalable vector graphics (SVG) files into SWF
resources that can be embedded in Flex clients.

### ‚òò Effects and styles
The Flash Player renders graphics using vectors, so it can perform highly expressive
transformations at run time. Flex effects provide a small taste of these sorts of animations.
Effects are transformations that you can apply to controls and containers using MXML
syntax.

The Effect tag shown in the MXML produces two results: The first nested tag dynamically
grows an image when the mouse hovers over it, and the second dynamically shrinks that
image when the mouse moves away. These effects are applied to the mouse events available
on the Image control for albumlmage.

Flex also provides effects for common animations like transitions, wipes, and modulating
alpha channels. In addition to the built-in effects, Flex supports the Flash drawing API for
truly innovative animations. Deeper exploration of this topic involves graphic design and
animation, and is beyond the scope of this section.

Standard styling is available through Flex's support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). If you
attach a CSS file to an MXML file, the Flex controls will follow those styles. For this example,
songStyles.css contains the following CSS declaration:

```css
//:! gui/flex/songStyles.css
.headerText {
    font-family: Arial, "_sans";
    font-size: 16;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.boldText {
    font-family: Arial, "_sans";
    font-size: 11;
    font-weight: bold;
}
///:~
```
This file is imported and used in the song library application via the Style tag in the MXML
file. After the style sheet is imported, its declarations can be applied to Flex controls in the

MXML file. As an example, the style sheet's boldText declaration is used by the TextArea
control with the songInfo id.

### ‚òò Events
A user interface is a state machine; it performs actions as state changes occur. In Flex, these
changes are managed through events. The Flex class library contains a wide variety of
controls with extensive events covering all aspects of mouse movement and keyboard usage.
The click attribute of a Button, for example, represents one of the events available on that
control. The value assigned to click can be a function or an inline bit of script. In the MXML
file, for example, the ControlBar holds the refreshSongsButton to refresh the list of
songs. You can see from the tag that when the click event occurs,
songService.getSongs( ) is called. In this example, the click event of the Button refers to
the RemoteObject which corresponds to the Java method.

### ‚òò Connecting to Java
The RemoteObject tag at the end of the MXML file sets up the connection to the external
Java class, gui.flex.SongService. The Flex client will use the getSongs( ) method in the
Java class to retrieve the data for the DataGrid. To do so, it must appear as a service‚Äîan
endpoint with which the client can exchange messages. The service defined in the
RemoteObject tag has a source attribute which denotes the Java class of the
RemoteObject, and it specifies an ActionScript callback function, onSongs( ), to be
invoked when the Java method returns. The nested method tag declares the method
getSongs( ), which makes that Java method accessible to the rest of the Flex application.
All invocations of services in Flex return asynchronously, through events fired to these
callback functions. The RemoteObject also raises an alert dialog control in the event of an
error.

The getSongs( ) method may now be invoked from Flash using ActionScript:

    songService.getSongs();

Because of the MXML configuration, this will call getSongs( ) in the SongService class:

```java
//: gui/flex/SongService.java
package gui.flex;
import java.util.*;

public class SongService {
    private List < Song > songs = new ArrayList < Song > ();
    public SongService() { fillTestData(); }
    public List < Song > getSongs() { return songs; }
    public void addSong(Song song) { songs.add(song); }
    public void removeSong(Song song) { songs.remove(song); }
    private void fillTestData() {
        addSong(new Song("Chocolate", "Snow Patrol",
            "Final Straw", "sp-final-straw.jpg",
            "chocolate.mp3"));
        addSong(new Song("Concerto No. 2 in E", "Hilary Hahn",
            "Bach: Violin Concertos", "hahn.jpg",
            "bachviolin2.mp3"));
        addSong(new Song("'Round Midnight", "Wes Montgomery",
            "The Artistry of Wes Montgomery",
            "wesmontgomery.jpg", "roundmidnight.mp3"));
    }
} ///:~
```
Each Song object is just a data container:

```java
//: gui/flex/Song.java
package gui.flex;

public class Song implements java.io.Serializable {
    private String name;
    private String artist;
    private String album;
    private String albumImageUrl;
    private String songMediaUrl;
    public Song() {}
    public Song(String name, String artist, String album,
        String albumImageUrl, String songMediaUrl) {
        this.name = name;
        this.artist = artist;
        this.album = album;
        this.albumImageUrl = albumImageUrl;
        this.songMediaUrl = songMediaUrl;
    }
    public void setAlbum(String album) { this.album = album; }
    public String getAlbum() { return album; }
    public void setAlbumImageUrl(String albumImageUrl) {
        this.albumImageUrl = albumImageUrl;
    }
    public String getAlbumImageUrl() { return albumImageUrl; }
    public void setArtist(String artist) {
        this.artist = artist;
    }
    public String getArtist() { return artist; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setSongMediaUrl(String songMediaUrl) {
        this.songMediaUrl = songMediaUrl;
    }
    public String getSongMediaUrl() { return songMediaUrl; }
} ///:~
```
When the application is initialized or you press the refreshSongsButton, getSongs( ) is
called, and upon returning, the ActionScript onSongs(event.result) is called to populate
the songGrid.

Here is the ActionScript listing, which is included with the MXML file's Script control:

```java
//: gui/flex/songScript.as
function getSongs() {
    songService.getSongs();
}

function selectSong(event) {
    var song = songGrid.getItemAt(event.itemIndex);
    showSongInfo(song);
}

function showSongInfo(song) {
    songInfo.text = song.name + newline;
    songInfo.text += song.artist + newline;
    songInfo.text += song.album + newline;
    albumImage.source = song.albumImageUrl;
    songPlayer.contentPath = song.songMediaUrl;
    songPlayer.visible = true;
}

function onSongs(songs) {
    songGrid.dataProvider = songs;
} ///:~
```
To handle DataGrid cell selections, we add the cellPress event attribute to the DataGrid
declaration in the MXML file:

    cellPress="selectSong(event)"

When the user clicks on a song in the DataGrid, this will call selectSong( ) in the
ActionScript above.

### ‚òò Data models and data binding
Controls can directly invoke services, and ActionScript event callbacks give you a chance to
programmatically update the visual controls when services return data. While the script
which updates the controls is straightforward, it can get verbose and cumbersome, and its
functionality is so common that Flex handles the behavior automatically, with data binding.

In its simplest form, data binding allows controls to reference data directly instead of
requiring glue code to copy data into a control. When the data is updated, the control which
references it is also automatically updated without any need for programmer intervention.
The Flex infrastructure correctly responds to the data change events, and updates all controls
which are bound to the data.

Here is a simple example of data binding syntax:

<mx:Slider id="mySlider"/>
<mx:Text text="{mySlider.value}" />

To perform data binding, you place references within curly braces: {}. Everything within
those curly braces is deemed an expression for Flex to evaluate.

The value of the first control, a Slider widget, is displayed by the second control, a Text
field. As the Slider changes, the Text field's text property is automatically updated. This
way, the developer does not need to handle the Slider's change events in order to update the
Text field.

Some controls, such as the Tree control and the DataGrid in the song library application,
are more sophisticated. These controls have a dataprovider property to facilitate binding to
collections of data. The ActionScript onSongs( ) function shows how the
SongService.getSongs( ) method is bound to the dataprovider of the Flex DataGrid.
As declared in the RemoteObject tag in the MXML file, this function is the callback that
ActionScript invokes whenever the Java method returns.

A more sophisticated application with more complex data modeling, such as an enterprise
application making use of Data Transfer Objects or a messaging application with data
conforming to complex schemas, may encourage further decoupling of the source of data
from the controls. In Flex development, we perform this decoupling by declaring a "Model"
object, which is a generic MXML container for data. The model contains no logic. It mirrors
the Data Transfer Object found in enterprise development, and the structures of other
programming languages. By using the model, we can databind our controls to the model, and

at the same time have the model databind its properties to service inputs and outputs. This
decouples the sources of data, the services, from the visual consumers of the data, facilitating
use of the Model- View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In larger, more sophisticated applications,
the initial complexity caused by inserting a model is often only a small tax compared to the
value of a cleanly decoupled MVC application.

In addition to Java objects, Flex can also access SOAP-based Web services and RESTful
HTTP services using the WebService and HttpService controls, respectively. Access to all
services is subject to security authorization constraints.

### ‚òò Building and deploying
With the earlier examples, you could get away without a -flexlib flag on the command line,
but to compile this program, you must specify the location of the flex-config.xml file using
the -flexlib flag. For my installation, the following command works, but you'll have to
modify it for your own configuration (the command is a single line, which has been
wrapped):

```sh
//:! gui/flex/buiId-command.txt
mxmlc -flexlib "C:/Program Files/Macromedia/Flex/jrun4/servers/default/flex/WEB-INF/flex
songs.mxml"
///:~
```
This command will build the application into an SWF file which you can view in your
browser, but the book's code distribution file contains no MP3 files or JPG files, so you won't
see anything but the framework when you run the application.

In addition, you must configure a server in order to successfully talk to the Java files from the
Flex application. The Flex trial package comes with the JRun server, and you can start this
through your computer's menus once Flex is installed, or via the command line:

    jrun -start default

You can verify that the server has been successfully started by opening
http://localhost:8700/samples in a Web browser and viewing the various samples (this is
also a good way to get more familiar with the abilities of Flex).

Instead of compiling the application on the command line, you can compile it via the server.
To do this, drop the song source files, CSS style sheet, etc., into the
jrun4/servers/default/flex directory and access them in a browser by opening
http://localhost:870o/flex/songs.mxml.

To successfully run the app, you must configure both the Java side and the Flex side.
Java: The compiled Song.java and SongService.java files must be placed in your WEB-
INF/classes directory. This is where you drop WAR classes according to the J2EE
specification. Alternatively, you can JAR the files and drop the result in WEB-INF/lib. It
must be in a directory that matches its Java package structure. If you're using JRun, these
would be placed in 

    jrun4/servers/defauIt/flex/WEB-INF/classes/gui/flex/Song.cIass
    jrun4/servers/default/flex/WEBINF/classes/gui/flex/SongService.class

You also need the image and MP3 support files
available in the Web app (for JRun, jrun4/servers/default/flex is the Web app root).
Flex: For security reasons, Flex cannot access Java objects unless you give permission by
modifying your flex-config.xml file. For JRun, this is located at

    jrun4/servers/default/flex/WEB-INF/flex/flex-config.xml

Go to the <remote-objects> entry in that file, look at the <whitelist> section within, 
and see the following note:

    <!--
    For security, the whitelist is locked down by default. Uncomment the source element
    below to enable access to all classes during development.

    We strongly recommend not allowing access to all source files in production, since this
    exposes Java and Flex system classes. <source>*</source>
    -->

Uncomment that <source> entry to allow access, so that it reads <source> * </source>.
The meaning of this and other entries is described in the Flex configuration docs.

Exercise 38: (3) Build the "simple example of data binding syntax" shown above.

Exercise 39: (4) The code download for this book does not include the MP3S or JPGs
shown in SongService.java. Find some MP3S and JPGs, modify SongService.java to
include their file names, download the Flex trial and build the application.

## üçÄ24.13 Creating SWT applications
As previously noted, Swing took the approach of building all the UI components pixel-by-
pixel, in order to provide every component desired whether the underlying OS had those
components or not. SWT takes the middle ground by using native components if the OS
provides them, and synthesizing components if it doesn't. The result is an application that
feels to the user like a native application, and often has noticeably faster performance than
the equivalent Swing program. In addition, SWT tends to be a less complex programming
model than Swing, which can be desirable in a large portion of applications. ¬π¬≤

¬π¬≤ Chris Grindstaff was very helpful in translating SWT examples and providing SWT information.

Because SWT uses the native OS to do as much of its work as possible, it can automatically
take advantage of OS features that may not be available to Swing‚Äîfor example, Windows has
"subpixel rendering" that makes fonts on LCD screens clearer.

It's even possible to create applets using SWT.

This section is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction to SWT; it's just enough to give
you a flavor of it, and to see how SWT contrasts with Swing. You'll discover that there are lots
of SWT widgets and that they are all reasonably straightforward to use. You can explore the
details in the full documentation and many examples that can be found at www.eclipse.org.
There are also a number of books on programming with SWT, and more on the way.

### ‚òò Installing SWT
SWT applications require downloading and installing the SWT library from the Eclipse
project. Go to www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and choose a mirror. Follow the links to the
current Eclipse build and locate a compressed file with a name that begins with "swt" and
includes the name of your platform (for example, "win32"). Inside this file you'll find
swt.jar. The easiest way to install the swt.jar file is to put it into your jre/lib/ext directory
(that way you don't have to make any modifications to your classpath). When you
decompress the SWT library, you may find additional files that you need to install in
appropriate places for your platform. For example, the Win32 distribution comes with DLL
files that need to be placed somewhere in your java.library.path (this is usually the same
as your PATH environment variable, but you can run object/ShowProperties.java to
discover the actual value of java.library.path). Once you've done this, you should be able
to transparently compile and execute an SWT application as if it were any other Java
program.

The documentation for SWT is in a separate download.

An alternative approach is just to install the Eclipse editor, which includes both SWT and the
SWT documentation that you can view through the Eclipse help system.

### ‚òò Hello, SWT
Let's start with the simplest possible "hello world"-style application:

```java
//: swt/HelloSWT.java
// {Requires: org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display; You must
// install the SWT library from http://www.eclipse.org }
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class HelloSWT {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Display display = new Display();
        Shell shell = new Shell(display);
        shell.setText("Hi there, SWT!"); // Title bar
        shell.open();
        while (!shell.isDisposed())
            if (!display.readAndDispatch())
                display.sleep();
        display.dispose();
    }
} ///:~
```
If you download the source code from this book, you'll discover that the "Requires" comment
directive ends up in the Ant build.xml as a prerequisite for building the swt subdirectory;
all the files that import org.eclipse.swt require that you install the SWT library from
www.eclipse.org.

The Display manages the connection between SWT and the underlying operating system‚Äîit
is part of a Bridge between the operating system and SWT. The Shell is the top-level main
window, within which all the other components are built. When you call setText( ), the
argument becomes the label on the title bar of the window.

To display the window and thus the application, you must call open( ) on the Shell.

Whereas Swing hides the event-handling loop from you, SWT forces you to write it explicitly.
At the top of the loop, you check to see whether the shell has been disposed‚Äînote that this
gives you the option of inserting code to perform cleanup activities. But this means that the
main( ) thread is the user interface thread. In Swing, a second event-dispatching thread is
created behind the scenes, but in SWT your main( ) thread is what handles the UI. Since by
default there's only one thread and not two, this makes it somewhat less likely that you'll
clobber the UI with threads.

Notice that you don't have to worry about submitting tasks to the user interface thread like
you do in Swing. SWT not only takes care of this for you, it throws an exception if you try to
manipulate a widget with the wrong thread. However, if you need to spawn other threads to
perform long-running operations, you still need to submit changes in the same way that you
do with Swing. For this, SWT provides three methods which can be called on the Display
object: asyncExec(Runnable), syncExec(Runnable) and timerExec(int, Runnable).

The activity of your main( ) thread at this point is to call readAndDispatch( ) on the
Display object (this means that there can only be one Display object per application). The
readAndDispatch( ) method returns true if there are more events in the event queue,
waiting to be processed. In that case, you want to call it again, immediately. However, if
nothing is pending, you call the Display object's sleep( ) to wait for a short time before
checking the event queue again.

Once the program is complete, you must explicitly dispose( ) of your Display object. SWT
often requires you to explicitly dispose of resources, because these are usually resources from
the underlying operating system, which may otherwise become exhausted.

To prove that the Shell is the main window, here's a program that makes a number of Shell
objects:

```java
//: swt/ShellsAreMainWindows.java
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class ShellsAreMainWindows {
    static Shell[] shells = new Shell[10];
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Display display = new Display();
        for (int i = 0; i < shells.length; i++) {
            shells[i] = new Shell(display);
            shells[i].setText("Shell #" + i);
            shells[i].open();
        }
        while (!shellsDisposed())
            if (!display.readAndDispatch())
                display.sleep();
        display.dispose();
    }
    static boolean shellsDisposed() {
        for (int i = 0; i < shells.length; i++)
            if (shells[i].isDisposed())
                return true;
        return false;
    }
} ///:~
```
When you run it, you'll get ten main windows. The way the program is written, if you close
any one of the windows, it will close all of them.

SWT also uses layout managers‚Äîdifferent ones than Swing, but the same idea. Here's a
slightly more complex example that takes the text from System.getProperties( ) and adds
it to the shell:

```java
//: swt/DisplayProperties.java
import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.layout.*;
import java.io.*;

public class DisplayProperties {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Display display = new Display();
        Shell shell = new Shell(display);
        shell.setText("Display Properties");
        shell.setLayout(new FillLayout());
        Text text = new Text(shell, SWT.WRAP | SWT.V_SCROLL);
        StringWriter props = new StringWriter();
        System.getProperties().list(new PrintWriter(props));

        text.setText(props.toString());
        shell.open();
        while (!shell.isDisposed())
            if (!display.readAndDispatch())
                display.sleep();
        display.dispose();
    }
} ///:~
```
In SWT, all widgets must have a parent object of the general type Composite, and you must
provide this parent as the first argument in the widget constructor. You see this in the Text
constructor, where shell is the first argument. Virtually all constructors also take a flag
argument that allows you to provide any number of style directives, depending on what that
particular widget accepts. Multiple style directives are bitwise-ORed together as seen in this
example.

When setting up the Text( ) object, I added style flags so that it wraps the text, and
automatically adds a vertical scroll bar if it needs to. You'll discover that SWT is very
constructor-based; there are many attributes of a widget that are difficult or impossible to
change except via the constructor. Always check a widget constructor's documentation for the
accepted flags. Note that some constructors require a flag argument even when they have no
"accepted" flags listed in the documentation. This allows future expansion without modifying
the interface.

### ‚òò Eliminating redundant code
Before going on, notice that there are certain things you do for every SWT application, just
like there were duplicate actions for Swing programs. For SWT, you always create a Display,
make a Shell from the Display, create a readAndDispatch( ) loop, etc. Of course, in some
special cases, you may not do this, but it's common enough that it's worth trying to eliminate
the duplicate code as we did with net.mindview.util.SwingConsole.
We'll need to force each application to conform to an interface:

```java
//: swt/util/SWTApplication.java
package swt.util;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public interface SWTApplication {
    void createContents(Composite parent);
} ///:~
```
The application is handed a Composite object (Shell is a subclass) and must use this to
create all of its contents inside createContents( ). SWTConsole.run( ) calls
createContents( ) at the appropriate point, sets the size of the shell according to what the
user passes to run( ), opens the shell and then runs the event loop, and finally disposes of
the shell at program exit:

```java
//: swt/util/SWTConsole.java
package swt.util;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class SWTConsole {
    public static void
    run(SWTApplication swtApp, int width, int height) {
        Display display = new Display();
        Shell shell = new Shell(display);
        shell.setText(swtApp.getClass().getSimpleName());
        swtApp.createContents(shell);
        shell.setSize(width, height);
        shell.open();
        while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
            if (!display.readAndDispatch())
                display.sleep();
        }
        display.dispose();
    }
} ///:~
```
This also sets the title bar to the name of the SWTApplication class, and sets the width
and height of the Shell.

We can create a variation of DisplayProperties.Java that displays the machine environment,
using SWTConsole:

```java
//: swt/DisplayEnvironment.java
import swt.util.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.layout.*;
import java.util.*;

public class DisplayEnvironment implements SWTApplication {
    public void createContents(Composite parent) {
        parent.setLayout(new FillLayout());
        Text text = new Text(parent, SWT.WRAP | SWT.V_SCROLL);
        for (Map.Entry entry: System.getenv().entrySet()) {
            text.append(entry.getKey() + ": " +
                entry.getValue() + "\n");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SWTConsole.run(new DisplayEnvironment(), 800, 600);
    }
} ///:~
```
SWTConsole allows us to focus on the interesting aspects of an application rather than the
repetitive code.

Exercise 40: (4) Modify DisplayProperties.java so that it uses SWTConsole.

Exercise 41: (4) Modify Display Environment.java so that it does nor use
SWTConsole.

### ‚òò Menus
To demonstrate basic menus, this example reads its own source code and breaks it into
words, then populates the menus with these words:

```java
//: swt/Menus.java
// Fun with menus.
import swt.util.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.mindview.util.*;

public class Menus implements SWTApplication {

    private static Shell shell;
    public void createContents(Composite parent) {
        shell = parent.getShell();
        Menu bar = new Menu(shell, SWT.BAR);
        shell.setMenuBar(bar);
        Set <String> words = new TreeSet <String> (
            new TextFile("Menus.java", "\\W+"));
        Iterator <String> it = words.iterator();
        while (it.next().matches("[0-9]+"))
        ; // Move past the numbers.
        MenuItem[] mItem = new MenuItem[7];
        for (int i = 0; i < mItem.length; i++) {
            mItem[i] = new MenuItem(bar, SWT.CASCADE);
            mItem[i].setText(it.next());
            Menu submenu = new Menu(shell, SWT.DROP_DOWN);
            mItem[i].setMenu(submenu);
        }
        int i = 0;
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            addItem(bar, it, mItem[i]);
            i = (i + 1) % mItem.length;
        }
    }
    static Listener listener = new Listener() {
        public void handleEvent(Event e) {
            System.out.println(e.toString());
        }
    };
    void
    addItem(Menu bar, Iterator < String > it, MenuItem mItem) {
        MenuItem item = new MenuItem(mItem.getMenu(), SWT.PUSH);
        item.addListener(SWT.Selection, listener);
        item.setText(it.next());
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SWTConsole.run(new Menus(), 600, 200);
    }
} ///:~
```
A Menu must be placed on a Shell, and Composite allows you to fetch its shell with
getShell( ). TextFile is from net.mindview.util and has been described earlier in the
book; here a TreeSet is filled with words so they will appear in sorted order. The initial
elements are numbers, which are discarded. Using the stream of words, the top-level menus
on the menu bar are named, then the submenus are created and filled with words until there
are no more words.

In response to selecting one of the menu items, the Listener simply prints the event so you
can see what kind of information it contains. When you run the program, you'll see that part
of the information includes the label on the menu, so you can base the menu response on
that‚Äîor you can provide a different listener for each menu (which is the safer approach, for
internationalization).

### ‚òò Tabbed panes, buttons, and events
SWT has a rich set of controls, which they call widgets. Look at the documentation for
org.eclipse.swt.widgets to see the basic ones, and org.eclipse.swt.custom to see
fancier ones.

To demonstrate a few of the basic widgets, this example places a number of sub-examples
inside tabbed panes. You'll also see how to create Composites (roughly the same as Swing
JPanels) in order to put items within items.

Here, createContents( ) sets the layout and then calls the methods that each create a
different tab. The text on each tab is set with setText( ) (you can also create buttons and
graphics on a tab), and each one also sets its tool tip text. At the end of each method, you'll
see a call to setControl( ), which places the control that the method created into the dialog
space of that particular tab.

labelTab( ) demonstrates a simple text label. directoryDialogTab( ) holds a button
which opens a standard DirectoryDialog object so the user can select a directory. The
result is set as the button's text.

buttonTab( ) shows the different basic buttons. sliderTab( ) repeats the Swing example
from earlier in the chapter of tying a slider to a progress bar.

scribbleTab( ) is a fun example of graphics. A drawing program is produced from only a
few lines of code.

Finally, browserTab( ) shows the power of the SWT Browser component‚Äîa full-featured
Web browser in a single component.

### ‚òò Graphics
Here's the Swing SineWave.java program translated to SWT:


```java
//: swt/SineWave.java
// SWT translation of Swing SineWave.java.
import swt.util.*;

class SineDraw extends Canvas {
    private static final int SCALEFACTOR = 200;

                int maxWidth = getSize().x;
                double hstep = (double) maxWidth / (double) points;
                int maxHeight = getSize().y;
                pts = new int[points];
                for (int i = 0; i < points; i++)
                    pts[i] = (int)((sines[i] * maxHeight / 2 * .95) +
                        (maxHeight / 2));

                    e.display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_RED));
                for (int i = 1; i < points; i++) {
                    int x1 = (int)((i - 1) * hstep);
                    int x2 = (int)(i * hstep);
                    int y1 = pts[i - 1];

            double radians = (Math.PI / SCALEFACTOR) * i;
            sines[i] = Math.sin(radians);
        }
        redraw();
    }
}

public class SineWave implements SWTApplication {
    private SineDraw sines;

        SWTConsole.run(new SineWave(), 700, 400);

} ///:~
```
Instead of JPanel, the basic drawing surface in SWT is Canvas.

If you compare this version of the program with the Swing version, you'll see that SineDraw
is virtually identical. In SWT, you get the graphics context gc from the event object that's
handed to the PaintListener, and in Swing the Graphics object is handed directly to the
paintComponent( ) method. But the activities performed with the graphics object are the
same, and setCycles( ) is identical.

createContents( ) requires a bit more code than the Swing version, to lay things out and
set up the slider and its listener, but again, the basic activities are roughly the same.

### ‚òò Concurrency in SWT
Although AWT/Swing is single-threaded, it's easily possible to violate that single-
threadedness in a way that produces a non-deterministic program. Basically, you don't want
to have multiple threads writing to the display because they will write over each other in
surprising ways.

SWT doesn't allow this‚Äîit throws an exception if you try to write to the display using more
than one thread. This will prevent a novice programmer from accidentally making this
mistake and introducing hard-to-find bugs into a program.

Here is the translation of the Swing ColorBoxes.java program in SWT:

```
As in the previous example, painting is controlled by creating a PaintListener with a
paintControl( ) method that is called when the SWT thread is ready to paint your
component. The PaintListener is registered in the CBox constructor.

What's notably different in this version of CBox is the run( ) method, which cannot just call
redraw( ) directly but must submit the redraw( ) to the asyncExec( ) method on the
Display object, which is roughly the same as SwingUtilities.invokeLater( ). If you
replace this with a direct call to redraw( ), you'll see that the program just stops.
When running the program, you will see little visual artifacts‚Äîhorizontal lines occasionally
running through a box. This is because SWT is not doublebuffered by default, while Swing is.
Try running the Swing version side by side with the SWT version and you'll see it more
clearly. You can write code to double-buffer SWT; you'll find examples on the
www.eclipse.org Web site.

Exercise 42: (4) Modify swt/ColorBoxes.java so that it begins by sprinkling points
("stars") across the canvas, then randomly changes the colors of those "stars."


### ‚òò SWT vs. Swing?
It's hard to get a complete picture from such a short introduction, but you should at least
start to see that SWT, in many situations, can be a more straightforward way to write code
than Swing. However, GUI programming in SWT can still be complex, so your motivation for
using SWT should probably be, first, to give the user a more transparent experience when
using your application (because the application looks/feels like the other applications on that
platform), and second, if the responsiveness provided by SWT is important. Otherwise,
Swing may be an appropriate choice.

Exercise 43: (6) Choose any one of the Swing examples that wasn't translated in this
section, and translate it to SWT. (Note: This makes a good homework exercise for a class,
since the solutions are not in the solution guide.)



### ‚òò Summary
The Java GUI libraries have seen some dramatic changes during the lifetime of the language.
The Java 1.0 AWT was roundly criticized as being a poor design, and while it allowed you to
create portable programs, the resulting GUI was "equally mediocre on all platforms." It was
also limiting, awkward, and unpleasant to use compared with the native application
development tools available for various platforms.

When Java 1.1 introduced the new event model and JavaBeans, the stage was set‚Äînow it was
possible to create GUI components that could easily be dragged and dropped inside a visual
IDE. In addition, the design of the event model and JavaBeans clearly shows strong
consideration for ease of programming and maintainable code (something that was not
evident in the 1.0 AWT). But it wasn't until the JFC/Swing classes appeared that the
transition was complete. With the Swing components, cross-platform GUI programming can
be a civilized experience.

IDEs are where the real revolution lies. If you want a commercial IDE for a proprietary
language to get better, you must cross your fingers and hope that the vendor will give you
what you want. But Java is an open environment, so not only does it allow for competing
IDEs, it encourages them. And for these tools to be taken seriously, they must support
JavaBeans. This means a leveled playing field; if a better IDE comes along, you're not tied to
the one you've been using. You can pick up and move to the new one and increase your
productivity. This kind of competitive environment for GUI IDEs has not been seen before,
and the resulting marketplace can generate very positive results for programmer
productivity.

This chapter was only meant to give you an introduction to the power of GUI programming
and to get you started so that you can see how relatively simple it is to feel your way through
the libraries. What you've seen so far will probably suffice for a good portion of your UI
design needs. However, there's a lot more to Swing, SWT and Flash/Flex; these are meant to
be fully powered UI design toolkits. There's probably a way to accomplish just about
everything you can imagine.

enough to put in the print version of the 4 th edition of this book.


## üçÄ25.02 Thinking in C: Foundations for Java
At www.MindView.net, you will find the Thinking in C seminar as a free download. This
presentation, created by Chuck Allison and developed by MindView, is a multimedia Flash
course which gives you an introduction to the C syntax, operators and functions that Java
syntax is based upon.

Note that you must have the Flash Player from www.Macromedia.com installed on your
system in order to play Thinking in C.

## üçÄ25.03 Thinking in Java seminar
My company, MindView, Inc., provides five-day, hands-on, public and in-house training
seminars based on the material in this book. Formerly called the Hands-On Java seminar,
this is our main introductory seminar that provides the foundation for our more advanced
seminars. Selected material from each chapter represents a lesson, which is followed by a
monitored exercise period so that each student receives personal attention. You can find
schedule and location information, testimonials, and details at www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ25.04 Hands-On Java seminar-on-CD
The Hands-On Java CD contains an extended version of the material from the Thinking in
Java seminar and is based on this book. It provides at least some of the experience of the live
seminar without the travel and expense. There is an audio lecture and slides corresponding
to every chapter in the book. I created the seminar and I narrate the material on the CD. The
material is in Flash format, so it should run on any platform that supports the Flash Player.
The Hands-On Java CD is for sale at www.MindView.net, where you can find trial demos of
the product.

## üçÄ25.05 Thinking in Objects seminar
This seminar introduces the ideas of object-oriented programming from the standpoint of
the designer. It explores the process of developing and building a system, primarily focusing
on socalled ‚ÄúAgile Methods‚Äù or ‚ÄúLightweight Methodologies,‚Äù especially Extreme
Programming (XP). I introduce methodologies in general, small tools like the ‚Äúindex-card‚Äù
planning techniques described in Planning Extreme Programming by Beck and Fowler
(Addison-Wesley, 2001), CRC cards for object design, pair programming, iteration planning,
unit testing, automated building, source-code control, and similar topics. The course includes
an XP project that will be developed throughout the week.

If you are starting a project and would like to begin using object-oriented design techniques,
we can use your project as the example and produce a first-cut design by the end of the week.
Visit www.MindView.net for schedule and location information, testimonials, and details.

## üçÄ25.06 Thinking in Enterprise Java
This book has been spawned from some of the more advanced chapters in earlier editions of
Thinking in Java. This book isn't a second volume of Thinking in Java, but rather focused
coverage of the more advanced topic of enterprise programming. It is currently available (in
some form, likely still in development) as a free download from www.MindView.net.
Because it is a separate book, it can expand to fit the necessary topics. The goal, like Thinking
in Java, is to produce a very understandable introduction to the basics of the enterprise
programming technologies so that the reader is prepared for more advanced coverage of
those topics.

The list of topics will include, but is not limited to:
‚Ä¢ Introduction to Enterprise Programming
‚Ä¢ Network Programming with Sockets and Channels
‚Ä¢ Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
‚Ä¢ Connecting to Databases
‚Ä¢ Naming and Directory Services
‚Ä¢ Servlets
‚Ä¢ Java Server Pages
‚Ä¢ Tags, JSP Fragments and Expression Language
‚Ä¢ Automating the Creation of User Interfaces
‚Ä¢ Enterprise JavaBeans
‚Ä¢ XML
‚Ä¢ Web Services
‚Ä¢ Automated Testing

You can find the current state of Thinking in Enterprise Java at www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ25.07 Thinking in Patterns (with Java)
One of the most important steps forward in object-oriented design is the ‚Äúdesign patterns‚Äù
movement, chronicled in Design Patterns, by Gamma, Helm, Johnson & Vlissides (Addison-
Wesley, 1995). That book shows 23 general classes of problems and their solutions, primarily
written in C++. The Design Patterns book is a source of what has now become an essential,
almost mandatory, vocabulary for OOP programmers. Thinking in Patterns introduces the
basic concepts of design patterns along with examples in Java. The book is not intended to be
a simple translation of Design Patterns, but rather a new perspective with a Java mindset. It
is not limited to the traditional 23 patterns, but also includes other ideas and problem-
solving techniques as appropriate.

This book began as the last chapter in Thinking in Java, 1 st Edition, and as ideas continued to
develop, it became clear that it needed to be its own book. At the time of this writing, it is still
in development, but the material has been worked and reworked through numerous
presentations of the Objects & Patterns seminar (which has now been split into the
Designing Objects & Systems and Thinking in Patterns seminars).
You can find out more about this book at www.MindView.net.

## üçÄ25.08 Thinking in Patterns seminar
This seminar has evolved from the Objects & Patterns seminar that Bill Venners and I gave
for the past several years. That seminar grew too full, so we've split it into two seminars: this
one, and the Designing Objects & Systems seminar, described earlier in this appendix.
The seminar strongly follows the material and presentation in the Thinking in Patterns book,
so the best way to find out what's in the seminar is to learn about the book from
www.MindView.net.

Much of the presentation emphasizes the design evolution process, starting with an initial
solution and moving through the logic and process of evolving the solution to more
appropriate designs. The last project shown (a trash recycling simulation) has evolved over
time, and you can look at that evolution as a prototype for the way your own design can start
as an adequate solution to a particular problem and evolve into a flexible approach to a class
of problems.

This seminar will help you:
‚Ä¢ Dramatically increase the flexibility of your designs.
‚Ä¢ Build in extensibility and reusability.
‚Ä¢ Create denser communications about designs using the language of patterns.

Following each lecture there will be a set of patterns exercises for you to solve, where you are
guided to write code to apply particular patterns to the solution of programming problems.
Visit www.MindView.net for schedule and location information, testimonials, and details.

## üçÄ25.09 Design consulting and reviews
My company also provides consulting, mentoring, design reviews and implementation
reviews to help guide your project through its development cycle, including your company's
first Java project. Visit www.MindView.net for availability and details.

# üìú 26. B: Resources

## üçÄ26.01 Software
The JDK from http://java.sun.com. Even if you choose to use a third-party development
environment, it's always a good idea to have the JDK on hand in case you come up against
what might be a compiler error. The JDK is the touchstone, and if there is a bug in it, chances
are it will be well known.

The JDK documentation from http://java.sun.com, in HTML. I have never found a
reference book on the standard Java libraries that wasn't out of date or missing information.
Although the JDK documentation from Sun is shot through with small bugs and is
sometimes unusably terse, all the classes and methods are at least there. Sometimes people
are initially uncomfortable using an online resource rather than a printed book, but it's worth
your while to get over this and open the HTML docs so you can at least get the big picture. If
you can't figure it out at that point, then reach for the printed books.

## üçÄ26.02 Editors & IDEs
There is a healthy competition in this arena. Many offerings are free (and the non-free ones
usually have free trials), so your best bet is to simply try them out yourself and see which one
fits your needs. Here are a few:

JEdit, Slava Pestov's free editor, is written in Java, so you get the bonus of seeing a desktop
Java application in action. This editor is based heavily on plug-ins, many of which have been
written by the active community. Download from www.jedit.org.

NetBeans, a free IDE from Sun, at www.netbeans.org. Designed for drag-and-drop GUI
building, code editing, debugging, and more.

Eclipse, an open-source project backed by IBM, among others. The Eclipse platform is also
designed to be an extensible foundation, so you can build your own standalone applications
on top of Eclipse. This project created the SWT described in the Graphical User Interfaces
chapter. Download from www.Eclipse.org.

IntelliJ IDEA, the payware favorite of a large faction of Java programmers, many of whom
claim that IDEA is always a step or two ahead of Eclipse, possibly because IntelliJ is not
creating both an IDE and a development platform, but just sticking to creating an IDE. You
can download a free trial from www.jetbrains.com.

## üçÄ26.03 Books
Core Java TM 2, 7 th Edition, Volumes I & II, by Horstmann & Cornell (Prentice Hall,
2005). Huge, comprehensive, and the first place I go when I'm hunting for answers. The
book I recommend when you've completed Thinking in Java and need to cast a bigger net.

The Java TM Class Libraries: An Annotated Reference, by Patrick Chan and Rosanna
Lee (Addison-Wesley, 1997). Although sadly out of date, this is what the JDK reference
should have been: enough description to make it usable. One of the technical reviewers for
Thinking in Java said, ‚ÄúIf I had only one Java book, this would be it (well, in addition to
yours, of course).‚Äù I'm not as thrilled with it as he is. It's big, it's expensive, and the quality of
the examples doesn't satisfy me. But it's a place to look when you're stuck, and it seems to
have more depth (and sheer size) than most alternatives. However, Core Java 2 has more
recent coverage of many of the library components.

Java Network Programming, 2 nd Edition, by Elliotte Rusty Harold (O'Reilly, 2000). I
didn't begin to understand Java networking (or networking in general, for that matter) until I
found this book. I also find his Web site, Caf√© au Lait, to be a stimulating, opinionated, and
upto-date perspective on Java developments, unencumbered by allegiances to any vendors.
His regular updates keep up with fast-changing news about Java. See www.cafeaulait.org.
Design Patterns, by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides (Addison-Wesley, 1995). The
seminal book that started the patterns movement in programming, mentioned numerous
places in this book.

Refactoring to Patterns, by Joshua Kerievsky (Addison-Wesley, 2005). Marries
refactoring and design patterns. The most valuable thing about this book is that it shows you
how to evolve a design by folding in patterns as they are needed.

The Art of UNIX Programming, by Eric Raymond (Addison-Wesley, 2004). Although
Java is a cross-platform language, the prevalence of Java on the server has made knowledge
of Unix/Linux important. Eric's book is an excellent introduction to the history and
philosophy of this operating system, and is a fascinating read if you just want to understand
some of the roots of computing.

## üçÄ26.04 Analysis & design
Extreme Programming Explained, 2 nd Edition, by Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres.
(Addison-Wesley, 2005). I've always felt that there might be a much different, much better
program development process, and I think XP comes pretty darn close. The only book that
has had a similar impact on me was Peopleware (described later), which talks primarily
about the environment and dealing with corporate culture. Extreme Programming
Explained talks about programming and turns most things, even recent ‚Äúfindings,‚Äù on their
ear. They even go so far as to say that pictures are OK as long as you don't spend too much
time on them and are willing to throw them away. (You'll notice that the book does not have
the ‚ÄúUML stamp of approval‚Äù on its cover.) I could see deciding to work for a company based
solely on whether they used XP. Small book, small chapters, effortless to read, exciting to
think about. You start imagining yourself working in such an atmosphere, and it brings
visions of a whole new world.

UML Distilled, 2 nd Edition, by Martin Fowler (Addison-Wesley, 2000). When you first
encounter UML, it is daunting because there are so many diagrams and details. According to
Fowler, most of this stuff is unnecessary, so he cuts through to the essentials. For most
projects, you only need to know a few diagramming tools, and Fowler's goal is to come up
with a good design rather than worry about all the artifacts of getting there. In fact, the first
half of the book is all that most people will need. A nice, thin, readable book; the first one you
should get if you need to understand UML.

Domain-Driven Design, by Eric Evans (Addison-Wesley, 2004). This book focuses on the
domain model as the primary artifact of the design process. I have found this to be an
important shift in emphasis that helps keep designers at the right level of abstraction.
The Unified Software Development Process, by Ivar Jacobsen, Grady Booch, and
James Rumbaugh (Addison-Wesley, 1999). I went in fully prepared to dislike this book. It
seemed to have all the makings of a boring college text. I was pleasantly surprised‚Äîalthough
there are a few parts that have explanations that seem as if those concepts aren't clear to the
authors. The bulk of the book is not only clear, but enjoyable. And best of all, the process
makes a lot of practical sense. It's not Extreme Programming (and does not have their clarity

about testing), but it's also part of the UML juggernaut; even if you can't get XP through the
door, most people have climbed aboard the ‚ÄúUML is good‚Äù bandwagon (regardless of their
actual level of experience with it), so you can probably get it adopted. I think this book
should be the flagship of UML, and the one you can read after Fowler's UML Distilled when
you want more detail.

Before you choose any method, it's helpful to gain perspective from those who are not trying
to sell you one. It's easy to adopt a method without really understanding what you want out
of it or what it will do for you. Others are using it, which seems a compelling reason.
However, humans have a strange little psychological quirk: If they want to believe something
will solve their problems, they'll try it. (This is experimentation, which is good.) But if it
doesn't solve their problems, they may redouble their efforts and begin to announce loudly
what a great thing they've discovered. (This is denial, which is not good.) The assumption
here may be that if you can get other people in the same boat, you won't be lonely, even if it's
going nowhere (or sinking).

This is not to suggest that all methodologies go nowhere, but that you should be armed to the
teeth with mental tools that help you stay in experimentation mode (‚ÄúIt's not working; let's
try something else‚Äù) and out of denial mode (‚ÄúNo, that's not really a problem. Everything's
wonderful, we don't need to change‚Äù). I think the following books, read before you choose a
method, will provide you with these tools.

Software Creativity, by Robert L. Glass (Prentice Hall, 1995). This is the best book I've
seen that discusses perspective on the whole methodology issue. It's a collection of short
essays and papers that Glass has written and sometimes acquired (P.J. Plauger is one
contributor), reflecting his many years of thinking and study on the subject. They're
entertaining and only long enough to say what's necessary; he doesn't ramble and bore you.
He's not just blowing smoke, either; there are hundreds of references to other papers and
studies. All programmers and managers should read this book before wading into the
methodology mire.

Software Runaways: Monumental Software Disasters, by Robert L. Glass (Prentice
Hall, 1998). The great thing about this book is that it brings to the forefront what we don't
talk about: the number of projects that not only fail, but fail spectacularly. I find that most of
us still think, ‚ÄúThat can't happen to me‚Äù (or ‚ÄúThat can't happen again‚Äù), and I think this puts
us at a disadvantage. By keeping in mind that things can always go wrong, you're in a much
better position to make them go right.

Peopleware, 2 nd Edition, by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister (Dorset House, 1999).
You must read this book. It's not only fun, it rocks your world and destroys your
assumptions. Although DeMarco and Lister have backgrounds in software development, this
book is about projects and teams in general. But the focus is on the people and their needs,
rather than the technology and its needs. They talk about creating an environment where
people will be happy and productive, rather than deciding what rules those people should
follow to be adequate components of a machine. This latter attitude, I think, is the biggest
contributor to programmers smiling and nodding when XYZ method is adopted, and then
quietly doing whatever they've always done.

Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving & Getting Advice Successfully, by
Gerald M. Weinberg (Dorset House, 1985). A superb book, one of my all-time favorites. It's
perfect if you are trying to be a consultant or if you're using consultants and trying to do a
better job. Short chapters, filled with stories and anecdotes that teach you how to get to the
core of the issue with minimal struggle. Also see More Secrets of Consulting, published in
2002, or most any other Weinberg book.

Complexity, by M. Mitchell Waldrop (Simon & Schuster, 1992). This chronicles the coming
together in Santa Fe, New Mexico, of a group of scientists from different disciplines to
discuss real problems that their individual disciplines couldn't solve (the stock market in
economics, the initial formation of life in biology, why people do what they do in sociology,
etc.). By crossing physics, economics, chemistry, math, computer science, sociology, and
others, a multidisciplinary approach to these problems is developing. But more important, a
different way of thinking about these ultra-complex problems is emerging: away from
mathematical determinism and the illusion that you can write an equation that predicts all
behavior, and toward first observing and looking for a pattern and trying to emulate that
pattern by any means possible. (The book chronicles, for example, the emergence of genetic
algorithms.) This kind of thinking, I believe, is useful as we observe ways to manage more
and more complex software projects.

## üçÄ26.05 Python
Learning Python, 2 nd Edition, by Mark Lutz and David Ascher (O'Reilly, 2003). A nice
programmer's introduction to my favorite language, an excellent companion to Java. The
book includes an introduction to Jython, which allows you to combine Java and Python in a
single program (the Jython interpreter is compiled to pure Java bytecodes, so there is
nothing special you need to add to accomplish this). This language union promises great
possibilities.

## üçÄ26.06 My own list of books
Not all of these are currently available, but some can be found through used-book outlets.
Computer Interfacing with Pascal & C (self-published under the Eisys imprint, 1988.
Available for sale only from www.MindView.net). An introduction to electronics from back
when CP/M was still king and DOS was an upstart. I used high-level languages and often the
parallel port of the computer to drive various electronic projects. Adapted from my columns
in the first and best magazine I wrote for, Micro Cornucopia. Alas, Micro C was lost long
before the Internet appeared. Creating this book was an extremely satisfying publishing
experience.

Using C++ (Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1989). One of the first books out on C++. This is out of
print and replaced by its 2 nd edition, the renamed C++ Inside & Out.

C++ Inside & Out (Osborne/McGraw-Hill, 1993). As noted, actually the 2 nd edition of
Using C++. The C++ in this book is reasonably accurate, but it's circa 1992 and Thinking in
C++ is intended to replace it. You can find out more about this book and download the
source code at www.MindView.net.

Thinking in C++, 1 st Edition (Prentice Hall, 1995). This won the Software Development
Magazine Jolt Award for best book of the year.

Thinking in C++, 2 nd Edition, Volume 1 (Prentice Hall, 2000). Downloadable from
www.MindView.net. Updated to follow the finalized language standard.

Thinking in C++, 2 nd Edition, Volume 2, coauthored with Chuck Allison (Prentice Hall,
2003). Downloadable from www.MindView.net.

Black Belt C++: The Master's Collection, Bruce Eckel, editor (M&T Books, 1994). Out
of print. A collection of chapters by various C++ luminaries based on their presentations in
the C++ track at the Software Development Conference, which I chaired. The cover on this
book stimulated me to gain control over all future cover designs.

Thinking in Java, 1 st Edition (Prentice Hall, 1998). The 1 st edition of this book won the
Software Development Magazine Productivity Award, the Java Developer's Journal Editor's

Choice Award, and the JavaWorld Reader's Choice Award for best book. Downloadable from
www.MindView.net.

Thinking in Java, 2 nd Edition (Prentice Hall, 2000). This edition won the JavaWorld
Editor's Choice Award for best book. Downloadable from www.MindView.net.

Thinking in Java, 3 rd Edition, (Prentice Hall, 2003). This edition won the Software
Development Magazine Jolt Award for best book of the year, along with other awards listed
on the back cover. Downloadable from www.MindView.net.
