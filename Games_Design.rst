   玩家动机模型是 Nick Yee 和 Nicolas Ducheneaut 合作研究的关于玩家类型的游戏理论模型，此模型
   对全球 165 万独立玩家进行采样调查，归纳 6 种玩家群体：Action (动作)、Social (社交)、Mastery 
   (掌控)、Achievement (成就)、Immersion (沉浸式)、Creativity (创意)，每一大类分为两个小类，
   分别为：破坏与刺激、竞争与社区、挑战与策略、完成与权力、幻想与故事、设计与发现，共12类。

   研究发现，前三大玩家群体是 Strategy (59%)、Fantasy (60%)、Story (58%)。

   Nick Yee 通过对 2000 名中国玩家进行了动机侧写，与美国玩家进行比较后总结出了一套很有意思的统计数值。
   相较于美国玩家而言，中国玩家在竞争与完成度上尤为突出，但在幻想与故事、发现与设计也就是沉浸动机与创造
   动机上较低。相较于美国玩家而言中国 75% 的玩家更喜欢竞争。在性别条件上并无明显差异，男性玩家相较女性
   更关注于破坏且各年龄段下男女动机变化非常小。

   为什么中国游戏市场和玩家呈现出这类趋势？Nick Yee 做出了一系列猜测。

   第一，中国崇尚集体主义，而美国则更崇尚个人主义。竞争动机分析中 Nick Yee 认为，崇尚个人主义玩家
   竞争性应该更高，然而结果却恰恰相反。

   第二，因为中国游戏市场因政府管制呈现隔离状态。这就是为什么中国游戏市场如此庞大，游戏产品众
   多且火热，但向海外输出后会“水土不服”，“因为这两种玩家从一开始就不是玩的同一类型的游戏”。

   A Quick Primer On Interpreting

      ============== ==========
      Class          Percentile
      ============== ==========
      Community      44%
      Competition    39%
      Excitement     39%
      Destruction    43%
      Completion     46%
      Power          35%
      Strategy       59%
      Challenger     39%
      Fantasy        60%
      Story          58%
      Discovery      48%
      Designy        47%
      ============== ==========
   
      Percentile Ranks

      Imagine if we went to a school of 1,000 students and arranged
      everyone in a row by height. Every student would have a
      percentile rank—the % of students they are taller than.
      So the student right in the middle would be 50th %-tile (the
      average). And a student at the 10th %-tile is taller than 10% of the
      student body, but shorter than 90% of the student body.

      The Motivation Chart
   
      The chart in each audience report provides the percentile rank for
      each motivation for the target game audience--i.e., if this game
      audience were an individual gamer, where would they fall in the
      full data set?

      The line in the middle represents the average gamer (the 50th %-
      tile) in our full data set.

      Thus a Power score of 35% is moderately below average. If this
      game audience were an individual gamer, they would score higher
      than 35% of gamers on Power, but lower than 65% of gamers.

      As a whole, the chart visualizes the motivations that are
      disproportionately important and unimportant for this audience,
      relative to other gamers.

   Detail Action Cluster

   *  Destruction 

      Gamers who score high on this component are agents of chaos and
      destruction. They love having many tools at their disposal to blow things up
      and cause relentless mayhem. They enjoy games with lots of guns and
      explosives.

      They gravitate towards titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. And if they
      accidentally find themselves in games like The Sims, they are the ones who
      figure out innovative ways to get their Sims killed.

   *  Excitement

      Gamers who score high on this component enjoy games that are fastpaced, 
      intense, and provide a constant adrenaline rush. They want to be
      surprised. They want gameplay that is full of action and thrills, and rewards
      them for rapid reaction times.

      While this style of gameplay can be found in first-person shooters like Halo,
      it can also be found in games like Street Fighter and Injustice, as well as
      energetic platformers like BIT.TRIP RUNNER.

   Detail Social Cluster

   *  Competition

      Gamers who score high on this component enjoy competing with other
      players, often in duels, matches, or team-vs-team scenarios.

      Competitive gameplay can be found in titles like Starcraft, League of Legends, or
      the PvP Battlegrounds in World of Warcraft. But competition isn’t always
      overtly combative; competitive players may care about being acknowledged as
      the best healer in a guild, or having a high ranking/level on a Facebook
      farming game relative to their friends.

   *  Community

      Gamers who score high on Community enjoy socializing and collaborating with
      other people while gaming. They like chatting and grouping up with other
      players.

      This might be playing Portal 2 with a friend, playing Mario Kart at a party, or
      being part of a large guild/clan in an online game. They enjoy being part of a
      team working towards a common goal. For them, games are an integral part of
      maintaining their social network.

   Detail Mastery Cluster

   *  Challenge

      Gamers who score high on Challenge enjoy playing games that rely heavily
      on skill and ability. They are persistent and take the time to practice and hone
      their gameplay so they can take on the most difficult missions and bosses that
      the game can offer.

      These gamers play at the highest difficulty settings and don’t mind failing
      missions repeatedly in games like Dark Souls because they know it’s the only
      way they’ll master the game. They want gameplay that constantly challenges
      them.

   *  Strategy

      Gamers who score high on this component enjoy games that require
      careful decision-making and planning. They like to think through their options
      and likely outcomes. These may be decisions related to balancing
      resources and competing goals, managing foreign diplomacy, or finding
      optimal long-term strategies.

      They tend to enjoy both the tactical combat in games like XCOM or Fire
      Emblem, as well as seeing their carefully-devised plans come to fruition
      in games like Civilization, Cities: Skylines, or Europa Universalis.

   Detail Achievement Cluster

   *  Completion

      Gamers with high Completion scores want to finish everything the game has
      to offer. They try to complete every mission, find every collectible, and
      discover every hidden location.

      For some players, this may mean completing every listed achievement or
      unlocking every possible character/move in a game. For gamers
      who score high on Design, this may mean collecting costumes and mounts
      in games like World of Warcraft.

   *  Power

      Gamers who score high on this component strive for power in the
      context of the game world. They want to become as powerful as possible,
      seeking out the tools and equipment needed to make this happen.

      This may mean maxing stats or acquiring the most powerful weapons.
      Power and Completion often together, but some players enjoy collecting
      cosmetic items without caring about power, and some players prefer
      attaining power through strategic optimization rather than grinding.

   Detail Immersion Cluster

   *  Fantasy

      Gamers who score high on Fantasy want their gaming experiences to allow
      them to become someone else, somewhere else. They enjoy the sense
      of being immersed in an alter ego in a believable alternate world, and enjoy
      exploring a game world just for the sake of exploring it.

      These gamers enjoy games like Skyrim, Fallout, and Mass Effect for their fully
      imagined alternate settings. Gamers who score high on Story want
      games with elaborate storylines and a cast of multidimensional characters
      with interesting back-stories and personalities.

   *  Story

      They take the time to delve into the back-stories of characters in games
      like Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and enjoy the elaborate and thoughtful
      narratives in games like The Last of Us and BioShock. Gamers who score
      low on Story tend to find dialogue and quest descriptions to be distracting and
      skip through them if possible.


   Detail Creativity Cluster

   *  Discovery

      Gamers who score high on Discovery are constantly asking “What if?” For
      them, game worlds are fascinating contraptions to open up and tinker
      with.

      In an MMO, they might swim out to the edge of the ocean to see what
      happens. In MineCraft, they might experiment with whether crafting
      outcomes differ by the time of day or proximity to zombies. They “play”
      games in the broadest sense of the word, often in ways not intended or
      imagined by the game’s developers.

   *  Design

      Gamers who score high on this component want to actively express
      their individuality in the game worlds they find themselves in.

      In games like Mass Effect, they put a lot of time and effort in the character
      creation process. In city-building games or space strategy games, they take the
      time to design and customize exactly how their city or spaceships look. To
      this end, they prefer games that provide the tools and assets necessary
      to make this possible and easy to do.



🟡 独立游戏开发方法论
===================

   游戏（Games）的一个流行的概念是“第九艺术”，文学、绘画、音乐、舞蹈、雕塑、戏剧、建筑、电影所有 8 
   种艺术形式之后的又一种艺术形式。电子游戏又是可以集合文学、绘画、音乐等等所有艺术形式的，具有交互、
   娱乐功能的艺术载体。游戏除了基本的娱乐性，还可以具有挑战、社交、教育、训练等潜在属性。

   游戏有多种分类形式，就其玩法而言，可分为玩家对战（PvP）和玩家对战环境（PvE）两种形式。根据是否可
   联网，又可以分为单机游戏（Offline Games）和联机游戏（Online Games）。

   还可以根据玩家在游戏中的功能来划分：

   *  即时策略游戏（RTS，Real-Time Strategy Game）；
      *  多人在线战术竞技游戏（MOBA，Multiplayer online battle arena）
   *  角色扮演游戏（RPG，Role Playing Game）；
   *  冒险游戏（AVG，Adventure Game）；
   *  模拟游戏（SLG，Simulation Game）；
   *  动作类游戏（ACT，Action Game）；
      *  射击游戏（STG，Shooting Game）；

   除了电子游戏外，还有传统的游戏项目或者体育（游戏）项目，这里不作过多讨论。

   在游戏分类上，有一种非常特殊的“游戏”，甚至可以不看作是游戏，而是“交互式广告阅读器”，这就是
   超休闲游戏（Hypercasual game）。

   超休闲游戏的核心在流媒体推广，也就是将传统广告互动化。这类游戏属于小品级产品，操作简单、安装包极小，
   一般还都是竖版，方便手机上单手操作，还是免费类型。游戏核心就是每局游戏时间特别短，操作失败观看激励
   视频即可复活继续，游戏内 ad 广告跑过推广类流媒体，这款游戏就算制作成功。

   这类游戏的目标用户是碎片化都市人群，主打一个碎片化互动看广告，因此目标用户并非一般意义上的游戏玩家。
   其推广看平台看渠道，大推还是小推，是不是发推海，每个平台渠道获客价都不同，启推金也不同。综合来看，
   以人民币结算，想小推一下临时引个流，最低两千块启冲，小手一抖眨眼就没，想玩个大的进榜三，准备好十万，
   一月之内全能给你造完。当然你下载量也会剧增。至于用户量增多少？就看产品的本事了，几万到几千万不等。

   独立游戏开发（Indie game developers）并非单独一人的开发，独立的意义在于游戏开发主导权的独立。
   即使有团队，有外部资金支持，只要游戏主导权不受外部干扰，那么就是独立游戏开发。Indie /ˈɪndɪ/ 一词
   源自唱片工业，独立音乐（Independent music）或称硬地音乐（Indie music），是指有别于主流商业
   唱片厂牌制作的音乐。顾名思义，独立音乐的制作过程独立自主，从录音到出版都由音乐家独立完成，核心思想
   在于独立自主。

   独立游戏开发者在选择启动项目之前需要做的一些工作：

   *  理解游戏开发的工作：一个创造软件产品的工作；
   *  深入理解游戏开发成本：从游戏项目启动，持续迭代，到完成作品、发布，最终流向目标用户手上；

   游戏项目立项时选择的游戏类型决定了这份工作的难度或者完成游戏制作所涉及的技术，一般来说，以下是一般
   2D/3D 游戏项目制作过程会涉及到的技术或工序：

   *  确定游戏运行平台环境与目标用户：主机（Console）、PC、掌机、手机；
   *  游戏创意与玩法设计，策划、文案、游戏世界观的构建，选择故事叙述模式；
   *  配乐、音效设计，如有必要，还可能需要配音、与多语言支持，可能会需要使用到 Musecore 这类软件；
   *  根据游戏类型来选择合适的游戏引擎，比如 UnrealEngine 或者 Godot，适合的引擎可以降低游戏实现的复杂度；
   *  根据游戏引擎选择使用的编程语言，原型阶段使用脚本快速实现 DEMO，成熟后再使用静态编译语言改写；
   *  根据游戏玩法、机制设计场景、角色、UI，这需要 Krita/Blender 这些图形设计或建模软件；
   *  无论 2D 还是 3D 游戏，角色动画是必不可少的内容，这部分对艺术基础要求较高；
   *  使用着色器（GPU 编程）实现特效，一般游戏都会使用着色器提升画面效果，同时还能降低 CPU 负担；
   *  为游戏搭建场景，将角色、动画、配乐，或者语音融合到游戏场景中，制作关卡。如果有点追求，将电影镜头语言加入游戏中；
   *  建立版本管理系统，明确游戏的功能列表（Features）、原型阶段和产品阶段，避免功能频繁变更带导致工作量在无意间增加；
   *  不断迭代完善，如果可以，招募原始测试玩家，并建立反馈机制，适时综合测试反馈意见，对游戏加以提升；
   *  选择好游戏发售平台，比如 store.steampowered.com，store.epicgames.com 或者 itch.io 等等。
   *  预发布期热身，如果不签发行商，那么自己就需要想办法在发布前期增加曝光量，和更多的潜在用户建立联系；

   不同公司在岗位设置上差别较大，大公司可能为了方便管理，岗位分工更细致，比如，美术部分可能就有原画、
   动画设计、角色设计；程序部分可能细分前端开发（游戏客户端）、服务端开发、引擎开发；技术与美术结合
   部分可能设置渲染工程师、技术美术（TA）、动画师、环境设计师等等。此外，还有管理、策划、推广等岗位。

   Digital Content Creation (DCC) 数字内容创作工具是最现代的生产力工具，包括但不仅限于 2D/3D、
   音频/视频剪辑合成、动态/互动内容创作、图像编辑等等。

   例如，用于视频游戏制作的 UE5、U3D，完全免费开源的 Godot，建模与动画工具 Blender 等等。2D 动画制作
   工作如 Spine、OpenToonz 等等。程序化贴图 SubstanceDesigner，数字化布料 Style3D (国产之光)、
   VStitcher、MarvelousDesigner，雕刻建模工具 ZBrush，电影特效魔术师 Houdini，工业设计和建筑设计
   Rhino，以及传统的收费 3D 工具，如 3Dmax、Maya 等等。

   UnrealEngine 作为一款优秀的大型游戏引擎，其效果非常棒，最新的国产 AAA 大作《黑悟空：神话》就是
   最好的广告。Godot 作为一个新秀，也完全开源，易学易用，并且具有适量的源代码，不会像 UE5 那样宏大。

   把产品做好并不等同于完成整个游戏的生命周期，完成游戏产品制作只是这个工作中的一个工序。后续将产品装
   到用户的设备中依然要花费很多成本，这个过程一般涉及与发行商打交道， 这个过程中的交易成本甚至可能大于
   游戏软件本身的开发成本。也就是说，把产品分发到用户设备里，远远要难于把产品开发出来。和发行商合作也许
   是一个不错的选择，但是这里面可能有坑，选择信誉好的合作伙伴可以最大程度避免自己的损失，还可以避免自己
   被卖身。和发行商签订分成合同时需要注意，按毛利（Gross Avenue）分成或者是按净利润（Net Avenue）
   分成，后者会在发行商扣除一切成本（不排除巧立名目榨取利润）后的额度进行分成。发行商作为合作伙伴，他们
   可能提供的服务包括：

   *  联系媒体、新闻资源对游戏进行宣传；
   *  游戏话题事件制造，炒作游戏热度；
   *  游戏宣传视频制作与直播，带游戏去参展；
   *  替换开发者维护游戏社区；
   *  向平方索取资源；
   *  发售前支付开发者版权费用，或者预付款（此款项要在利润中扣除）；

   游戏通过 Steam 这些电子交易平台出售后，售货款扣除分成后，在打回国内。不过这之前还会涉及一个
   预提所得税（Withholding income tax）。主要是对游戏在美区的销售收入征收一个 10% ~ 30%
   的预提税。这笔预提税无论多少，都可以抵免国内所得税，记得申报纳税的时候带着 Steam 的税单和报告
   去税务局申请抵免。

   预提所得税，简称预提税，是指预先扣缴的所得税。它不是一个税种，而是世界上对这种源泉扣缴的所得税的
   习惯叫法。我国税法第三条和实施条例第九十一条规定，外国企业在中国境内未设立机构、场所，而有取得的
   来源于中国境内的利润（股息、红利）、利息、租金、特许权使用费和其他所得，或者虽设立机构、场所，但
   上述所得与其机构、场所没有实际联系的，都应当缴纳百分之十的所得税。

🟡 我的游戏计划种子
================


- ✨Seeding 种子能有什么用呢？对啊，播种能收获什么呢？是什么未知的世界呢？对啊，能和它们交流吧？
- ✨千年农夫
- ✨游戏三国
- ✨毒壤 (Toxicant Soil)

   在一个古老的世界，有一群原住人，它们靠土地而生，靠土地而繁衍，靠土地而文明。直到一天，地里的
   作物慢慢枯萎而死，所有人都慌乱了，用不了多久，他们都会饿死在这片祖祖辈辈生活的家园……

   玩家有两种玩法：毒狼模式、统筹模式。在毒狼模式下，玩家扮演一个原住民，并且要探索出，正在这片
   土地上发生的现象背后的原因。统筹模式下，玩家将以酋长的视角，联合一切力量打败这股未知的力量。

- ✨百业
   
   如果认真起来，世间行业何止百业，每个时代都有各自适配的行业，从古至今，有的行业消失了，
   有的行业又不断的衍生创造出来以适应新的时代需要，甚至一些黑暗的职业。百业将从有限的视角出发，
   让你从微观的个 视角出发，去深入了一个社会的整体。通过一个个缩影，去概括这个世界的本质。
   通过一个个职业，让你认清人类的本质。

- ✨危机 

   我自认为有深刻的危机意识，几乎每天活在危机意思之下，假定我明天就死掉，现在的我会选择做什么？
   人类是有认识局限的，从出生的完全局部，再经过学习不断减少局限，但这个过程必定只是一个逐步靠近
   完全无局限，并且永远不可达。一个包装危机的游戏体量有限，也许只能去反映一个社会现象，比如历史中
   下岗潮，或者是新冠疫情后时代的经济危机，都是不错的故事题材。

- ✨Next 次世代

   新世界大潮袭来，人们还沉浸在充满诱惑的生活中，为了满足无止境的物质追求，都不愿意为高仰的
   育儿成本买单，全球各国都出现的断崖式的人口下跌。

   而科技也你像极贪婪的人类，把触角伸展到了各个角落。元宇宙、基因编辑、人造物种、人工智能……

   然而，随着时间不断推进，人类在最有希望的人工智能的实践中遇阻，并且被证明不可行，满足不了
   未来世界对科技的需要，实现不了在全世界进行更大规模的劳动力解放。

   从原始社会茹毛饮血，到农业社会的耕作，到工业社会的机器化，再到电气化信息化，持续的社会进步
   看似给人类带来了无尽的享受和无限的可能。但其实，DNA里埋藏的阴暗面即有一个巨大的缺陷，图谋
   不轨的叛变者不再满足于利用原始的畜力、或者是新的能源动力，他们谋划着终极能源——大脑智力！

   而就在一家名为 Next Metaverse 的科技公司内，一场阴谋正在萌芽，它将会彻底改变人类的世界。

   元宇宙这个词源于 1992 年尼尔·斯蒂芬森的《雪崩》，这本书描述了一个平行于现实世界的虚拟世界，
   Metaverse，所有现实生活中的人都有一个网络分身 Avatar。

🌟六角战士（Mighty warrior）
================================================================================

   相比上世纪 40 年代漂亮国的经济崩盘，亲自经历当下经济危机的过程中，更能对人生道路产生感悟。

   你将与所有理想成为六角战士（Mighty warrior）的同志结成最牢固的、人类最先进的群体，
   向消灭工作制度这一初级目标进击。婚姻制度将回归原始，人类需要的只是一种联系而不是枷锁。
   当人类的后代与父代的强联系打破后，人类出生就开始公平的生存环境，也许这才是终极社会制度。

   在未来，人类将全面普及大学教育，所有人都强制完成大学教育，并且根据自己的兴趣选择专业方向。
   这将成为每一个人生命之中第二个最重要的事，这标志了一个人成为真正的人！

   一些既不产出物质文明、又不产出精神文明的行业将完全失去存在的土壤，人类从这些行业中完全解放。
   因此，生产力将不会再被这些毫无作用的行业固化，而是作用于更有意义的行业，满足更多的物质与精神需求。
   得益于经济结构的变革与完善，人尽其才物尽其用，人类已经不需要被强制工作，取而代之的是大量的时间自由，
   可以更专注于各自的理想人生，长期存在的工作制度也将由此瓦解，人类社会终于在不久的将来深刻地涌现。

   在成为六角战士之前，天降大任必劳其筋骨，将经历一场足以让你脱胎换骨的斗争，并终将成为人类史上
   第一批六角战士，他们拥有同一个称呼 —— 地上星！他们终将地带领人类走出太阳系文明，向更广袤的星际进发。

   著名制作人 Raphaël Colantonio 开发。

   游戏给人印象中的既视感，更像是一种游戏设计底层的理念带来的“共鸣”，例如游戏非常强调环境
   互动元素的逻辑关系，在游戏刚开始就指引玩家学会如何用投掷油灯来点燃油桶并借此消灭敌人，
   后续还会有在下雨天对湿身的敌人投掷电击手雷，和把毒瓦斯桶踢到篝火上引爆等进阶技巧。

   游戏甚至在一些小细节上有着莫名的执着，例如一个空的木桶只要摆正了，而天上正在下雨，
   那么木桶就一定会被重新装满水。也可以攻击 NPC 人物，他们都有朋友圈，也会与你结仇。

   其理念仍然暗合了“沉浸模拟”类游戏的核心做法——在游戏机制和技术允许的前提下，尽量让玩家
   能够把现实当中的事物互动逻辑套用到游戏当中。

   这是一款继承了 Colantonio 所钟情的“沉浸模拟”设计理念，却又采用了古典的俯视角呈现的动作冒险游戏。

   A game about friendship, love and technology in a place where bits have replaced atoms.
   
   Intro
   Sebastian has just landed his first job in the distant city of Dorisburg. He moves 
   there to start his adult life and figure out who he really wants to be. Among 
   a strange collection of people, hackers and activists he finds some true friends – 
   perhaps even love. But can they stop the terrible deeds of the people ruling the 
   city? And who will get their heart broken in the end?”

   Else Heart.Break() is a reimagination of the adventure game: a fantastic story

   Games, and Level Ex. He has had graphics work featured in SIGGRAPH. This will be 
   his first independent release.

   Mystralia, and Chasm to market. He's facilitated the launch of hundreds of

   2024 年各大平台诞生了不少热门游戏，包括《FF7RB》《小丑牌》《P3R》《圣兽之王》《龙之信条2》...

   《动物井》是一款「类银河恶魔城」游戏，但有别于市面上常见的作品，本作采用了「无战斗」的设计，主打解密和探索。
   此外，不同于大多数同类作品采用的偏线性路线设计，本作几乎是完全的开放世界，能力的获取并没有先后次序。

   本作一个非常不可思议的地方就是它的容量，PC 版仅有 30MB，Switch 版也只有 70MB。这么小的体积，
   其视觉效果却是一点也不落后。由于本作并未像现代游戏那样采用大量的贴图和模型，避免了大量的数据文件。
   而是采用程序化纹理、实时着色的像素，使用 GPU 着色器程序实时渲染特效，因此做到了极小体积的同时，
   让游戏的像素效果非常惊艳。

   除了画面表现外，本作的音效也非常出色，特别是场景音效，极大地提升了游戏的临场感和代入感。另外，本作的
   NS 版支持 HD 震动，触感极佳。无论是主角移动还是使用悠悠球等操作，操作反馈都非常舒适！

   「银河城」的老祖宗《密特罗德》早就有「破序」的玩法，指脱离开发者最初设计好的路线，提前进入后期区域、
   或是提前拿到后期的能力。但无论是《密特罗德》还是目前市面上大多数同类游戏，它们的「破序」要求都很高，
   是属于「开发者意图以外」的路线。

   但《动物井》却从一开始，就采用了开放世界的设计思路。就好像《旷野之息》中的神兽完全不用按固定顺序一样，
   《动物井》中的4个主线目标同样没有固定顺序，玩家可以根据自己的节奏进行。

   当然，作为「银河恶魔城」设计最重要的一环，「获得新能力」在本作中也一样是开放的，并没有先后次序之分。
   大家应该可以想象到，如果一款游戏一味地追求开放、无脑给玩家自由，那样只会适得其反，让游戏体验变得
   一团糟。这也是《动物井》最让人惊叹的设计之一，本作虽然给了玩家极高的自由度，却并没有因为关键能力
   获取状况导致卡关，游戏总能让玩家发现接下来最合适的道路。

   游戏中大量存在的、甚至可以说是多到离谱的隐藏路线，也让本作的探索过程充满未知，总有惊喜等待着玩家。

   无战斗但也不简单，不同于《空洞骑士》等作品，《动物井》中完全没有战斗内容——毕竟主角是连手都没有的
   一颗果冻球，如果让没玩过游戏的玩家来看下面这张图，或许都找不到主角在哪...

   游戏也有一些缺点，虽然整体来看无伤大雅，但在某些时刻确实可能让人烦躁。

   游戏虽然有血量（心心）的概念，但也存在一些即死的关卡，比如被移动的石板直接压死。死亡后会立即在
   上一个存档点复活，但游戏的存档点不多，很多时候需要跑不少路。但如果只是复活跑图，其实对体验的影响
   还没有那么大，因为死亡前的进度还是会保留。但地图中存在一些复活后需要重新开启的机关，玩家在从复活
   点再次前往的过程中，需要经历一个非常繁琐的重开机关的过程。如果在关卡死多几次，着实会让人抓狂。

      the psychological stresses of adventuring.

      Recruit, train, and lead a team of flawed heroes through twisted forests,

   一款有着浓郁克苏鲁风格的、手绘哥特式钢笔画风的“恐怖”游戏，玩家需要全程围绕角色的压力来保持
   角色的正常不至于崩溃。考验玩家的不仅仅知识战力的提升，还有协作搭配。

   故事讲述了一名贵族领主挖掘出一个隐藏在领土中的邪恶存在，并因此引发了一连串惨剧。玩家将扮演
   领主的远亲，受邀前往祖先故土重振家族荣誉，收复故土，因此卷入怪异且不可名状的恐怖事件中。

   先祖在古老的、被谣言阴影包围的家族宅邸中度过了一生。在享尽一切奢华与糜烂的生活后，他开始厌倦了
   那几乎不变的灯红酒绿。就在那时，奇特而令人不安的传言暗示着家族庄园本身可能是通往某个不可名状、
   难以置信力量的大门。先祖开始耗尽全力去发掘和复原，将家族所有财富花在了黝黑的工人与结实的铁锹上。
   透过在最深处的地基下浸着盐的岩层中的传送门接触到了远古的邪恶。祖先等人的脚步惊扰了远古的生物，
   并就此陷入死亡与癫狂的领域之中。最终，只有祖先独自一人狂奔逃离那远古拱廊，直至他失去意识。
   在他醒来后，他参悟了这里面的一种神秘力量，然后着手写信请求远亲回来，将家族从那贪婪吞噬家族荣光
   的魔影中解救出来……

   游戏玩法设计上以“耐压性”为中心，玩家需要通过各种技能压制压力或者降低压力怪的攻击，角色属性设计
   主要分为三类，一般属性（Stats）和技能（Abilities）属于游戏基本配置，决定了角色的基本能力，
   持续元素（Persistent elements）会在游戏过程中不断获得、替换、清除，它们会影响一般属性。角色
   死亡是永久的，不可复活。游戏战斗场景中使用了亮度（light level），角色使用的各种饰品特性一般
   与光亮程度有关：

   1	Stats

      1. 精度修正 Accuracy Modifier
      2. 暴击机率 Critical Chance
      3. 伤害输出 Damage
      4. 躲避受击 Dodge
      5. 队友保护 Protection
      6. 进攻速度 Speed

   2	Persistent elements

      1.	特质 Quirks
      2.	疾病 Diseases
      3.	压力 Stress
      4. 死亡 Death

   3	Abilities

      1.	对战技能 Combat skills，所有技能都有角色站位要求，并且可攻击的位置也有限制。
      2.	扎营技能 Camping skills，在中途点击木柴扎营，扎营时间 12，施放技能要消耗时间。

   速度（SPD）决定了英雄在战斗中相对于其他角色和敌人的优先级。在每一轮战斗开始时，为每个角色分配
   一个从 1 ~ 8 的随机数，并将角色的 SPD 值加到这个数上；角色轮流出现的可能性顺序基于这个数字，
   从最高开始，以最低结束。速度为 8 的英雄/怪物更有可能先于速度为 5 的之前行动，但这并不能保证。
   每个英雄都有一个速度基值，该基值取决于职业和武器级别，可通过适用的饰品、增益、疾病和怪癖修饰。

   怪物种族一共有四种，每种与特定角色都克制关系：
   ::

      种族           位置     克制
      人类 Human     废墟     
      野兽 Beast     兽窟、海湾  、海怪。
      异魔 Unholy    废墟     死灵法师、先知。十字军对异魔有明显的 +15% 优势（升级到最高 +35% 的伤害）。
      邪秽 Eldritch  旷野     大部分小怪，叫鸦骷髅食尸鬼，流血抗性高，适合使用训犬师（狗哥）。

   暗黑地牢 I 共有 16 个角色，DLC 补充两个，角色有各自职业类型，不同类型有不同专长，通过决心等级
   升级能力。决心等级分为七级：0 旅者、1 学徒、2 勇者、3 精英、4 大师、5 冠军、6 传奇。分别是：

   === ============== ======================
   1.  Abomination    咒缚者（狼人）
   2.  Antiquarian    古董商人（商人/古商）
   3.  Arbalest       弩手（箭手）
   4.  Bounty Hunter  赏金猎人（赏金）
   5.  Crusader       十字军
   6.  Grave Robber   盗墓贼（盗墓）
   7.  Hellion        蛮族战士（恶女）
   8.  Highwayman     强盗
   9.  Houndmaster    训犬师（狗哥）
   10. Jester         小丑
   11. Leper          麻风剑客（麻风）
   12. Man-at-Arms    老兵
   13. Musketeer      火枪手（枪手）
   14. Occultist      神秘学者（阿三）
   15. Plague Doctor  瘟疫医生（疫医/医生）
   16. Vestal         修女
   17. Flagellant     苦修者（苦修）DLC 专属角色
   18. Shieldbreaker  破盾者（破盾）DLC 专属角色
   === ============== ======================

   游戏策略中控制压力是一个非常重要的内容，可以有主动出击和被动降压（例如小丑自带的降压技能），
   主动出击则是通过眩晕、移位技能控制、降低敌方输出，其中以狗哥、老兵、阿三、疫医最为优秀，眩晕
   技能附带伤害输出、或者像疫医可以双后位同时控制住。饰品选择根据角色功能来考虑，做控的尽量提高
   眩晕的概率。总体来说，属性优先级：速度、精准、暴击三者最为重要，缺一不可。饰品会在每周开始时
   根据当前拥有的英雄等级更新的任务中出来，选择难度合适的进行挑战。比如，阿三可以搭配一个恶魔
   坩埚，它拥有 +30% 眩晕和 +40% 减益技能概率加成，还有 +3 暴击。这个饰品会和出现 Hag 巫婆
   一起出现，它会用坩埚将英雄煮到濒死状态才倒出来。这个小 Bose 的属性数据如下，弱点在于放血：

   玩家需要通过驿站马车进行英雄的招募以组成探险队，进行各区域任务的执行与探索。招募后的英雄将以
   人物卡的形式整编为名册显示在城镇界面的右侧，通过点击人物卡可了解相应英雄的技能、属性、状态的
   信息，建筑可以使用祖产进行升级，可以将提高英雄名册的上限人数。出发时可将招募英雄组成 4人小队。
   已经招募的英雄可以解雇，除非是因为新英雄有非常强力的加成特质和能力，或者原有英雄能力差，且有
   非常麻烦的负面物质（锁定），这时候才会考虑把原来的开除。开除英雄意味着升级装备、技能和其它资金
   花销全部付诸东流，所以一定要谨慎考虑。

   组队探险时注意，地图区有不同难度选择，尽量保持与英雄等级在 1 个级别内。英雄等级过低增加了难度，
   过高时会禁止参加。虽然可以利用 BUG 在点击开始时快速点过低难度的地图来让高级别英雄进入低级别
   地图，俗称“锁车门”。地图分为无 Boss 的训练区，还有 1 或者 2 个 Boss 的地图，在选择时会提示。

   祖产是用于升级建筑的特殊宝物，有四种祖产宝物：雕像、地契、画像和纹章。其中地契最为难得，它与
   日志看起来有点相似，日志用于回顾每周的活动，包括执行的任务、英雄的升级和死亡、触发的城镇事件、
   英雄治疗情况、遭遇的建筑事件等等，还可以查看管家目标。

   出发前可以补充消耗性资源，部分资源可以和随机生成的战场中的交互物品作用产生不同的效果。部分物品
   不需要互动物（如包裹，木箱等），需要互动时会出现提示框，此时使用相应的资源。比如以下常用的情境：
   
   *  草药：可以清洗动物尸体、铁处女、酒桶、拼凑的餐桌等以获得各种资源。
   *  钥匙、铁锹：可以开宝箱、锁住的展柜，如果直接上手，则会导致英雄损伤。
   *  铁锹：可以挖浅坟、藤壶箱、牡蛎贝壳、浮雕。
   *  血清：洗丢下的行李、老树获取资源，洗盐水池加血降压力。
   *  圣水：在光之圣坛、喷泉、雕像、忏悔室、诅咒喷泉使用可以降低英雄的压力。洗骨堆获取资源。
      洗可怕圣坛、旧神祭坛除负面特质，洗令人不安的雕像可以获得正面特质，草药洗珊瑚也可以获得正面特质。
      洗装饰瓮可以获得宝石、饰物，如果使用铁锹则会获得负面特质。
   *  火炬或草药：用在炼金桌上获取光照或资源。
   *  火把照跛行者祭坛会出一个 boss，类似章鱼的怪物，俗称爬爬，出场必定随机打乱角色顺序。
   *  点火把看书就不要了，压力暴增 100，书柜也没有好东西。但是看卷轴堆可以清除英雄的负面特质。
   *  盔甲：不需要物品交互，高概率获得 buff，低概率获得正向特质。
   *  火把照蠕动虫卵减压、草药洗酒箱可以减 30 压力。
   *  献祭石碑不用互动物，50 压力对赌移除负面特质或者获得正面特质。
   *  骨之祭坛不用互动物，获得正向 buff：伤害 +15%，精准 +10%，暴击 +5%。

   队伍中有某些英雄会免费提供一些补给品，例如瘟疫医生自带一件解毒剂，训犬师带的狗粮等等。此外修建
   区域建筑“粮仓”后，每次任务开始前将免费提供一定量食物。还会根据副本大小自动装备对应数量的木柴
   （大型副本2个，中型副本1个，小型副本无），同时会根据任务目标给予某些特殊任务物品。任务物品不可
   返售或丢弃。

   碎片尘埃可用于恢复英雄某些限次数的技能，但会增加压力，该效果自下个回合生效，同时获得一些战斗
   增益效果，可能加速度/精准/伤害等。同时获得两个持续一次任务的debuff：降低 10% 美德几率，
   增加 10% 受到压力伤害。多次使用时，受到的压力也会大幅增加。

   在房间中使用木柴就可以扎营，可以通过扎营技能降压力，但会消耗与剩余人数相同的食物量，若食物不足
   则会减血并且增加压力。每次扎营会有 12 点的时间，使用扎营技能会消耗相应的时间，技能只能使用一次。

   压力值极限为 200，压力极限会导致英雄直接暴毙，到达 100 压力时会随机出现折磨（高概率）/美德。
   折磨状态会加速队伍的解体，折磨会持续增加压力，这些折磨包括：

   1. 袭击队友，伤害队友。
   2. 英雄胡言乱语，导致所有队友压力提升。
   3. 不受控制，不可以控制英雄所用技能，不可以给该名英雄加血。

   触发折磨的英雄可能会自主行动并且受到能力值降低的惩罚，会不时说些负能量话语给队友加压（揶揄），
   让折磨状态英雄在小镇上进行任何压力释放活动后，折磨状态就会解除，如未处理英雄的折磨状态，这一
   状态将一直存续。如果通过降压技能或者通过暴击将压力降回 0 就可以解除折磨状态。

   食物和火把是探险时的必需品，没有它们，英雄的压力值会快速增长。火把提供的亮度是非常重要的因素，
   开始亮度是 100，亮度会随着移动不断降低，怪物能力会增强。使用火把、使用技能、与某些奇物互动
   可以提升亮度，扎营后亮度会恢复到 100。亮度从高到低分为五个等级，每点燃一个火把增加 25 亮度。
   可以使用有侦查才能的英雄来提前发现陷阱，否则陷阱触发时将对随机一位英雄造成伤害。侦查出的陷阱
   可以在队伍位靠近陷阱时，可以选择一位成功率高的英雄解除陷阱。障碍会阻挡英雄在走廊上行进的道路，
   可以选择使用铁铲清理，选择徒手清理则会给全队英雄造成大量血量和压力伤害，消耗时间导致亮度降低。

   如果将英雄当作消耗品，那么他们就像是蚂蚁一样的存在。蚂蚁之于人，就如人之于神，万物皆为刍狗。
   捎上一个古董商人负责开包开箱，他能够发现更多宝贝，然后在你认为最极限的时候退出任务，把所有的
   资源带出来。通过升级导师水平、武器工匠、护具工匠，就可以在驿站招募熟手英雄，而不必逐步磨练。

   克苏鲁神话（Cthulhu Mythos）是以美国作家霍华德·菲利普·洛夫克拉夫特的小说世界观为基础，
   由奥古斯特·威廉·德雷斯等人整理完善，并由诸多作者所共同创作的一系列文学作品中构建的世界观，
   是一种虚构的神话，在克苏鲁小说中则是以神话体系的身份出现。作品的共同主题是人类在宇宙中的渺小
   和以灾难性结局告终的知识探索。从这层意义上，游戏中的英雄就是先祖通过请求信召唤而来的消耗品。

   战斗是回合制设计，每回合开始时，每个英雄和怪物会随机获得正负 4 的速度，加上他们的速度修正后，
   按速度从高到低决定英雄和怪物本回合进行行动的顺序。

   英雄决心等级，通过完成任务获得砺炼值以达成等级的提升。高决心等级的英雄能够更好的抵抗压力，
   学习高等级的技能、使用高等级的装备。但与此同时也会拒绝参与低等级的任务。低决心等级的英雄在较
   高等级的区域探险中会遭遇更高的压力。

   英雄特质可分为积极与消极，随着探险也将获得更多的特质。通过疗养院可进行特质的移除或锁定。
   当英雄获得5个正面特质后，如再获得正面特质，会随机替换原有的正面特质。被锁定的特质不被替换，
   锁定正面怪癖的数量最高为 3。特殊正面特质（带有八芒星标记，每个名册一名英雄）可以被清除，
   无需锁定，也不会被顶替，拥有特殊正面特质的英雄死亡后，身上该特质会消失，重新进入天赋池，
   其他英雄可能在战斗中重新获得该特质。

   负面特质可以被清除不可被手动锁定（估计是防止笨蛋手滑锁定负面特质），如果负面怪癖在数次探险
   过程中未得到处理，它也有可能被自动锁定。就像锁定的正面怪癖一样，当获得新的负面怪癖时，已锁定
   的负面怪癖将不会被替换。被锁定的负面特质可以在疗养院清除，只需要一周时间，与处理未锁定负面
   特质时间相同，但是价格将变得更昂贵得多。

   `暗黑地牢基础常识-特质与疾病 <https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv16355365/>`__

   英雄存在战斗技能与扎营技能，通过工会、生存大师可以查看相应的技能升级、解锁技能选项。每个英雄
   在同一时间内只可以拥有 4 个可用的战斗技能（咒缚者除外）与扎营技能，在城镇可随时进行已学习的
   战斗技能与扎营技能的切换激活；在未遭遇怪物的探险路途中，则仅可进行英雄战斗技能的切换激活。

   每个英雄存在其相应的默认武器和护甲，武器和护甲不能被卸下，但可以根据英雄的决心等级在铁匠铺进行
   升级。此外每个英雄可至多佩带 2 种饰品，通过探险及游牧民货车购买可获取饰品。饰品根据其稀有度，
   分为普通（白）、优良（绿）、稀有（蓝）、非常稀有（红）、先祖（红）、猎获（金）、猩红庭院（金）、
   水晶（蓝绿）。部分饰品存在职业需求，仅可由相应的英雄佩带。英雄无法佩带两个相同的饰品。猩红庭院
   的饰品存在套装效果，通过装备两种存在套装效果的饰品，就会得到额外的属性奖励。

   游戏总共发布了 5 个 DLC 拓展包，完全体约 7GB。

   1. 猩红庭院（The Crimson Court）

      *  新英雄职业：苦修者及其饰品体系，所有英雄新增饰品套装，并带套装属性；
      *  区域建筑：10 种新建筑用以升级城镇；
      *  新地牢区域：庭院，采用最复杂、最迂回的机制设计而成
      *  新的敌人派系：5 个新 Boss。全新游荡 Boss：狂信者

   2. 星之彩（The Color Of Madness）

      *  新英雄招募方式：雇佣兵。所有英雄新增饰品套装，并带套装属性（在战斗中收集彗星碎片，兑换饰品）
      *  区域建筑：4 种新建筑用以扩建你的小镇
      *  新地牢区域：农庄。无尽任务，尽可能久地活下去，对付来袭的一波又一波敌人
      *  新的敌人派系：磨坊主和他忠诚的工人已经变成了行尸走肉。
      *  3 个新 Boss：磨坊主、星空怪，以及彗星本身
      *  新游戏机制：具有独特、强大效果的特质（代替光亮度玩法）

      农庄便是这个游戏的无尽模式，但想要开启无尽模式，还需要完成两个前置任务，分别是天中之光和
      收回农庄。这两个任务类似普通地牢任务，一个是杀死所有敌人，另一个是击杀BOSS。

      收回农庄任务中，最后直面BOSS农场主前固定刷新营火，下一个房间就是农场主，因此需抓住机会
      调整状态。农场主一回合两动，且会不断召唤瘪壳怪，难度中等。

      击败农场主后，即可开始无尽收获任务，也就是无尽模式。无尽模式下，怪物会一波又一波不断袭来，
      无穷无尽。怪物遗骸会变成畸变水晶，英雄击破水晶可以恢复血量，否则水晶将在一回合后自动爆炸
      并对所有英雄造成压力和血量伤害。每次探索农庄将花费一周时间，在农庄撤退不会有任何惩罚。
      农庄越到后面越吃力，因此发现情况不妙时及时点击左上角撤退，团灭将失去所有战利品。

   3、破盾者（The Shieldbreaker）

      *  新英雄职业：破盾者（及其饰品体系）
      *  3个新怪物——源自破盾者本体的可怕幻影，蜿蜒滑行在领地出没
      *  新的消耗品——御盾鳞片，在英雄需要时提供最后的防护堡垒

   4. 火枪手（The Musketeer）免费

      *  新英雄职业：火枪手（及其饰品体系）
      *  火枪手各方面与弩手一致，可以理解为官方出的弩手皮肤mod

   5. 屠夫马戏团（The Butcher's Circus）免费
   
   *  全新哈姆雷特地点：屠夫马戏团
   *  用 4 名英雄组成的战队进行无阻碍的 PvP 战斗（不要拿你的战役英雄冒险）
   *  冲击排行榜来展现你对英雄的指挥能力以及抵御不幸和暴力的能力
   *  解锁旗帜组件，用你的创造力来组装你自己的决斗纹章
   *  用新的角斗士小饰品来制定战略，在激战中战胜其他英雄
   
   屠夫马戏团 "The Butcher's Circus" 是暗黑地牢最后的扩展包，这个扩展包增加了一个全新的用户
   对战模式（PVP），让玩家能够与其他玩家进行对战。玩家可以使用由 4 名英雄组成的战队进行无阻碍的
   战斗，通过冲击排行榜来展现玩家对英雄的作战指挥能力，以及抵御不幸和暴力的能力。


🌟Oxygen Not included
================================================================================

   *  缺氧官方 https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included
   *  【缺氧流体学】 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1YV4y1L7mu/

   《缺氧》是开发《饥荒》Klei Entertainment 公司制作并发行的一款太空殖民模拟游戏（space-colony），
   其美术风格也一脉相承，并同样采用了横版 2D 布局。游戏背景设定为一批被派的复制人去挖掘、建立和维护一个
   小行星的地下基地，玩家帮助复制人获得需要的水、食物、氧气、适当的生存压力和适宜的温度来维持他们生命。

   游戏前期就是建立小行星基地，后期研发出火箭就可以开始星际探索。星图标记了宇宙中的小行星方位，使用火箭
   可以造访这些小行星。需要建造望远镜来解锁星图。可以使用望远镜来分析小行星，只有被分析过的小行星才能被
   火箭造访。即使已经完成了所有星球的分析任务，也不能拆除望远镜，因为殖民地中存在望远镜时才能获取星图信息。

   生态（Biome）是构成小行星的区域。不同的小行星包含不同的生态，其中冰霜星体具有 10 个不同的生态，其他
   小行星为 8 个。游戏中共有 11 种不同的生态，每个生态有各自的特定资源、背景色和初始温度。应当注意：
   初始温度只是游戏生成时的生态温度，生态温度本身并不具有恢复力。不同的生态间一般由深渊晶石隔开。

   在该游戏中，玩家需要采集一系列种类的资源，建造各种供复制人生存的东西，并且可能会遇到一些能攻击
   复制人的生物（一般不用担心）。该游戏没有目标，只要能长久的生存下去就行。

   游戏发行日期2019年7月31日，售价 58.00 元。

   2021 年，Klei Entertainment 公司同意腾讯收购股权，表示“工作室的各个方面完全的创意和运营自主权”。
   公司的华裔创始人 Jamie Cheng 在一篇论坛帖子中表示，Klei 将保留“完全自主权”，人员配备、项目或其他
   运营不会发生变化，公司目前规模在 50 人左右。


   游戏主界面采用与 Sierra 开发的 Caesar III《恺撒大帝Ⅲ》类似的分层信息地图来向玩家展示基地
   中的各项数据指标 [Overlays](https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Overlays)：

   游戏的“房间”概念是使用砖块、气闸围成的一个区域，内置不同的物品可以形成营房、卧室、餐厅、高级餐厅、
   公园、按摩诊所、医院、娱乐、发电厂、温室、畜舍、公共厕所、卫生间，不符全条件的则是杂物房，没有加成。
   有些房间类型对装饰度有要求，比如高级餐厅需要一个装饰度 20+ 的饰物，使用花盘种上一两棵安宁芷、极乐刺、
   雀跃掌，诱人荆棘、锦醇菇等就可以。参考： https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Room_Overlay

   孢子兰是一种会散发僵尸孢子的装饰性植物，装饰度虽然最高，80（范围：7 格），但是一般不用于装饰高级餐厅，
   它常自然生成于油质生态，开启了故事特质/生机组构仪后，可利用僵尸孢子制作生物机器人，每个生物机器人制作
   需要：300kg 钢 + 9,850,000 个僵尸孢子病菌（病菌分散于气体中通入）。


   游戏涉及物理、化学、生物等知识，拥有上百种物质元素，玩家需要通过种植获取食物、可以设计种植、养殖
   场所、设计逻辑电路实现自动化、建设矿厂精练厂生产基础建设需要的材料，可玩元素非常丰富。

   游戏中共包含了四种元素：固体、液体、气体以及特殊品（复合物 • 真空 • 虚空）。

   和现实相似的，一种物质可以通过加热与冷却在固、液、汽之间转换。当然有些转变是单向进行的。
   例如：沙子融化变成熔融玻璃，藻类加热会得到泥土。大多数的转化都是不需要借助其他设备的。
   原油可以经复杂的过程变成天然气：原油 → 石油 → 高硫天然气 → 液态甲烷 (+ 硫) → 天然气。
   要注意的是各种物质在游戏中的性质是不一定与现实相同的！
   https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Elements

   真空（Vacuum）是一个没有任何固体、液体或气体占据的区域，真空是完全不导热的绝热体。

   自然状态下，真空可以由以下几种方式产生：

   *  在砂岩生态中被铜矿和煤炭包围的地方自然生成
   *  在油质生态中，充满二氧化碳的空间可能会被浮油生物吸为真空
   *  太空生态（太空暴露）可以制造真空
   *  虚空（The Void）可以制造真空。

   人工制造真空主要有两种方法：

   *  用气泵抽走封闭空间内的所有气体；
   *  将某一空间填满砖块，再使用水门等结构，使复制人得以进出而气体不能流入空间内部，之后逐一拆除砖块。

   虚空（The Void）是一种特殊的元素，可由调试模式生成，也可以在高旋星体（需修改游戏文件）中见到。
   虚空与太空暴露的方格类似，会吞噬流入的气体和液体。不同之处在于，虚空还会吞噬落入其中的不稳定固体
   （如雪、碎冰等），不会被流入的物质替代（与真空不同），而且不可通过修建干板墙来避免吞噬。
   与真空类似，复制人无法和虚空交互。但可以通过在方格中建造砖块来消灭虚空。


   由于游戏的性质及其高度复杂性，有许多机制不符合真实世界，但玩家可以使用。对于这些行为中有多少
   被视为“公平游戏”存在争议，但最终由玩家决定。一般来说，这些机制分为两大类：

   * 异常行为（Unusual Behaviors），是开发人员为了简单或易于使用而故意设置的，
   * 漏洞利用（Exploits），它利用了系统中的怪癖或错误（或系统之间的交互）。

Debug Mode
----------

   游戏中的物体元素、建筑、水管、气管、电路、逻辑信号线路等等按层计算，并遵守“一格一物”原则进行有
   限的计算模拟游戏世界。为了方便学习各种游戏对象的使用，可以使用游戏提供的高调试命令，自由地摆弄。

   临时秘籍代码：此方法可在不创建文件且不重新启动游戏的情况下临时开启调试模式，并持续到游戏结束。

   *  进入主菜单（加载游戏且跳过抢鲜体验提示后出现的界面，或者在游戏中选择退出到主菜单）
   *  按顺序输入字母 KLEIPLAY（直接输入小写字母不需要按回车键）
   *  生效后，屏幕左下方显示的内部版本号后会附上一个“D”，比如 “正式版：APP-399948-D”
   *  调试模式现已激活，直到玩家退出游戏

   开启调试模式可解锁一系列特殊建筑，包括开发者发电机、开发者气泵、开发者液泵、开发者固体泵、开发者

Tutorial - Tech
----------------

   游戏使用科技树来管理各种建筑设备，只有通过拥有科技技能的复制人通过相关的研究后才能解锁相应的建筑，
   研究性建筑有三个，依次排序如下，具体参考科学建筑 `Science Buildings`_ ：
   
   *  研究站 `Research Station`_可以解锁基础设备建筑，需要电力支持；
   *  超级计算机 `Super Computer`_可以解锁高级科技，包括后期的航天科技，需要电力、净水资源支持；
   *  虚拟形象仪 `Virtual Planetarium`_可以解锁高级航天科技，需要在发射火箭后获取到的数据磁盘；

   具有天文学或数据分析研究技能的复制人能够使用虚拟天象仪，将数据磁盘以 1:1 比例转换成星际研究
   （数据分析研究）点数。装载了研究舱的火箭在完成一次太空任务后会在返回时掉落数据磁盘。每个研究舱
   每次可以带回 10 单位数据磁盘。此外，星图中每个目的地都有 5 项一次性的研究任务，每个研究舱每次
   最多可完成 1 项研究任务，并额外带回 50 单位数据磁盘。

   缺氧游戏的总体路线是：

   1. 建立一个小行星基地，先满足基地中复制人的日常生活：主要是温度管理、水资源利用、食品工业；
   2. 进行科技研究升级，发掘小星球资源，并为后期的航天探索工作提供支持；
   2. 建设航天工业设施，制造探索星图的火箭，并通过发射火箭来获取邻近小星球的资源。

   游戏中的资源是有限的，应该尽量循环使用，再生资源来自各种间歇泉（Geysers_）。

   为了方便在各种极端环境下工具，应该尽早研究、制造出太空服 `Atmo Suit`_。气压服（俗称太空服），
   它可为穿戴者提供氧气，隔绝病菌和液体，并为穿戴者提供隔热保护，但同时也会降低复制人的运动属性。
   气压服可以储存 75 千克的氧气（可供常规复制人呼吸 750 秒，即 1.25 周期），并只能通过气压服
   存放柜补充氧气。当气压服中存有氧气时，穿戴它的复制人会吸入内部的氧气，并将呼出的二氧化碳存储在
   气压服内，并且在复制人脱下气压服时释放到环境中（比如在检查站处脱下时释放在检查站的判定格）。
   太空服需要储存在专用柜中，并且添加使用气泵填充氧气。同时配合单向通行的太空服检查站来使用，复制人
   经过检查站时才会穿上太空服，所以检查站和存放柜一般设置在基地出口、复制人房间门口。由于太空服储氧
   量大，使用气泵充氧速度比较慢，每秒才 500g，需要 2:30 完成。假设有 10 个复制人，可以使用双气泵
   充氧，并且可以准备 15 ~ 20 套气压服，随时备用在储存柜中。检查站有两种通行模式，允许或者不允许
   在储存柜没有空位是回归通行，如果允许，则复制人返回检查柜时，会在储存柜满时将太空服丢在地上。地上
   的气压服如果没有人收拾放置到储存柜，可以选择它并指派给一位没有穿太空服务的复制人，这样他就会拣起来。
   气压服存放柜可以储存 200kg 氧气，并且以 1.875kg/s 的速率向气压服内充入氧气，40 秒可以充满一件
   75kg 氧气的气压服。而一个复制人的基准呼吸速率是 100g/s。每个周期 600s 只需要 60kg 氧气。每个
   储放柜 120 W，一直穿着每周期还不到平均 40 秒工作时间，平台功率消耗 6.67W。

   穿戴气压服的复制人不会消耗外部空气，磨损的气压服经太空服锻造台消耗 1 单位芦苇纤维修复后重复使用。
   气压服需要 300kg 精练金属和 2 单位芦苇纤维，铝、铁、钴都可以，可以通过金属精练厂生产，或者养殖
   光滑哈奇获得。芦苇纤维（Reed Fiber）可以通过采收野生的或种植的顶针芦苇 `Thimble Reed`_ 
   或者修剪训养好的毛鳞壁虎 `Drecko`_ 鳞片获得。注意，采收野外芦苇不要挖掉根，这样还可以继续长，
   并且不需要花费额外的人力养护，不像种植需要大量的污染水浇灌。

   养殖毛鳞壁虎时，需要设置具有照料站、修剪站的畜舍，分别用于驯化毛鳞壁虎和修剪毛鳞获取芦苇纤维。
   养殖环境最好是氢气以加速毛鳞生长，毛鳞壁虎吃活的火椒藤、芳香百合和米虱木。如果种植芳香百合，
   就需要在有氯气的环境中种植。可以使用小动物放生点来转移受捆绑的小动物，运送受捆绑的小动物的复制人
   不需要具备小动物养殖技能。通过将小动物放生到指定的适合生长的位置来提高产出。注意，小动物放置点
   受到当前房间内的小动物数量限制，只能放生最高 20 只，超出这个数量时无效。

   金、钨、铜、铁是游戏中重要的精练金属，各种高级建筑设备都需要，可以直接使用精练厂将相应的矿石一比
   一转化，也可以通过养殖光滑哈奇、黄金哈奇获得。碎石机和金属精炼器都能将金属矿精炼成铜，但是前者是
   粗炼，效率低下。铜矿等金属于矿物可以作为石壳哈奇和光滑哈奇的饲料。进食铜矿（或其它金属矿石）时，
   石壳哈奇会排泄出煤炭，并提高产下光滑哈奇蛋的概率，光滑哈奇则会排泄出相应的精练金属，转化效率介于
   碎石机、精练厂之间，转化质量为消化矿物质量的 75%。养殖可以获取所有工厂可以提炼的资源，比如木料，
   可以通过种植乔木树（Arbor Tree）收获，它也可以通过养殖木壳蟹来获得。

   电路和自动化会始终伴随着游戏，电力系统在一开始就需要进行设计，游戏提供了低功率电路使用的电线、导线，
   以及高负荷电线（Heavi-Watt Wire）、高负荷导线。高负荷电缆造价相对高，应该配合变压器和低等造价
   的电线、导线来给设备供电，它们的造价及功率数据如下：

   =================================== ======== ==================
   Wire                                    1kw       25 Matals Ore
   Wire Bridge                             1kw       25 Matals Ore
   Heavi-Watt Wire                        20kw      100 Matals Ore
   Heavi-Watt Joint Plate                 20kw      200 Matals Ore
   Power Transformer                       4kw      200 Matals Ore

   Conductive Wire                         2kw       25 Matals
   Conductive Wire Bridge                  2kw       25 Matals
   Heavi-Watt Conductive Wire             50kw      100 Matals
   Heavi-Watt Conductive Joint Plate      50kw      100 Matals
   Large Power Transformer                 1kw      200 Matals
   =================================== ======== ==================

   比如要在 20 格的距离铺设电路给一组 1kw 之内的设备供电，如果全用高负荷电线就需要 2000 的金属矿物，
   如果使用高负荷导线就需要 2000 精练金属。但是使用变压器和低造价的电线、导线铺设就只需要 200 + 25 * 20
   总共 700 金属矿物或者精练金属，是高负荷电缆的 1/3 左右。变压器用于隔断不同的电路，电路铺设需要
   按电路所有工作中的设备总功率来设计，即使高功率的用电器没有线索相应的线路，游戏逻辑上也是按线路的
   工作中的设备总功率来随机地破坏电路。拆除正常使用的建筑、电路会返还 100% 材料，过热损坏会有损失。

   变压器本身可以通过自动化信息启用、禁用，相应于一个电路开关，配合智能电池，可以在主电路缺电时关闭
   支路上的用电器，以保障主电路的设备用电安全。注意，电池或者智能电池本身会消耗电量，分别为 2kj 和
   400j，所以电池不是越多越好，留有备用电池足够支持添加发电原料的这段时间就可以了。

   电路的一大作用就是实现自动化，自动清扫器不仅可以收拾各种零散的资源并归集到储物箱，还可以给其它
   建造供应需要的原料，是自动化的运输系统的基础工具之一。这种系统的运作不需要复制人的劳动力来维持
   运转，从而解放他们的劳动力，使他们专注于其他任务。自动清扫器可以在以其自身为中心的 9x9 的区域内
   搬运固体的物品。比如，将食物原材料装入电动烤炉中，然后将其烹饪完成并掉落在地的食物装入其运作范围
   内的其他容器，比如说冰箱。自动清扫器的运作会遵循优先级系统的逻辑，这也就意味着它会将低优先级的
   容器中的物品转移到高优先级的容器之中。

   自动清扫器本身可以浸没在液体中工作，除了可以配合轨道运输，还可以给作物施肥。典型的是冰霜小麦的
   种植，这种植物不仅需要低温（生长温度 -55°C ↔ 5°C）、净水浇灌，还要施肥。可以使用冰息萝卜获得
   低温环境，或者使用液温调节器和导热液体管道来制冷。肥料可以通过肥料合成器制造，需要污水、磷矿和
   泥土等原料。灌溉可以使用水泵、水管、液培砖。施肥可以自动清扫器配合储物箱完成，储物箱存放肥料供
   自动清扫器使用。但是，自动清扫器无法完成其他任务，尤其是“耕作”、“收割”。要么人工收获，要么等待
   作物的挂留期结束后自然掉落，冰霜小麦果实的挂留时间 4 周期，这是多数作物的默认值。只要种植的作物
   足够多，是可以省下收获的工作时间，让作物自然成熟掉落果实。

   注意，清扫器的有效工作区域需要覆盖目标建筑的判定格，并且目标建筑优先级高于储物箱时，才会从储物箱
   获取相应的资源补充到目标建筑中。煤炭发电机、储物箱组合的测试中，即使发电机的优先级低于储物箱，也
   会从储物箱中获取煤炭补充到发电机中。建筑判定格 `Cell of Interest`_ 通常位于其蓝图最底一行中间
   一格（宽度为偶数则偏左一格）。一般来说，建筑判定格规则如下：

   *  复制人使用建筑的位置（不适用多个使用对象的建筑）
   *  向建筑供应物品的位置
   *  建筑以物品形式输出产物的位置
   *  电力接口所在的位置
   *  建筑蓝图的鼠标抓取点和旋转中心点
   *  内容物与外界进行热交换的位置
   *  内容物会与判定格位置的环境及其下方一格的固体砖块（除透气砖、网格砖）进行热交换。
   *  不过，对于一些建筑来说，上述位置可能不重合在一个方格上。

Tutorial - Water and Oxygen
---------------------------

   *  Oni Database https://oni-assistant.com/database/index
   *  ONI Food Calculator https://oni-assistant.com/tools/foodcalculator

   如游戏名字暗示，氧气是最为重要的生存资源，它与水有紧密的联系，掌握水循环原理以持续地利用污染水、
   浓盐水或纯净水，净化、分流或者水解产生氧气，或者直接使用污水种植。厕所用水，需要净水 5kg/人次，
   并且排出 11.7kg 污水，浴室用水则是恒量输入净水 1000g/s、输出 1000g/s 污水。在设计卫生系统时，
   可以将多余的污水过滤后循环使用，并且在末端排放多余的净水。

   净水器水消耗 120 瓦电力、过滤介质 1000 克/秒、污染水 5 千克/秒，就可以产生净水 5 千克/秒，
   污染土 200 克/秒。污染水等量转化为净水，过滤介质（沙子或者浮土）转化为 1/5 的污染土。浮土是
   可再生的资源，在地表的流星雨会带来大量的浮土。所以，基本的水循环中会按每周期每复制人 6.7kg 产生
   额外的水资源。

   污染水处理只需使用净水器过滤一下就只可以变净水，如果污染水中还有大量细菌，那么就可以利用氯气来杀菌，
   但是不能直接使用氯气来杀灭大量的细菌，每周期对细菌产生 29% 的致死率。要完全杀干净，就需将带菌污水
   少量注入在氯气中的储水罐中，稀释细菌密度后再杀干净。可以先将储水罐注满净水，再慢慢注带菌水。可以在
   储水罐入水口前加装液体流量阀以控制流量。当然，杀菌并不是紧要的事，因为复制人只要不喝带菌水，就不会
   有感染问题。同样，只要氧气不带细菌，复制人也不会吸入其它气体，细菌也有不会感染问题。细菌存活的条件
   是污染物，包括污染水、污染氧，使用空气净化器可以将污染氧净化为氧气，其实环境下细菌会因为替代率不足
   而逐渐消亡，而高温、氯气等会加速细菌的消亡。另外，使用好气闸的自动关闭功能可以很好地避免细菌的传播。

   电解器消耗 120 瓦电力、水 1000 克/秒，可以产生氧气 888 克/秒和氢气 112 克/秒，资源转化 100%，
   只是单纯消耗电力，输入的气体为 70+°C。每个复制人消耗氧气 100g/s，一台电解器就足以支持 8 个复制人
   的呼吸需要。每周期 600 秒，每个复制人每同期需要 60kg 氧气，如果完全靠水解供氧，那么水的损耗就是
   53.3kg 每周期。

   电解器产生氢气 113g/s，这足以供应一台氢气发电机 800w 满负荷发电，只需要 100g/s 氢气的量，另外
   再配合电控站芯片加持，可以实现1200w 发电量，足以供三几台气泵和一台电解器共 600w 满负荷运行，还有
   余量供应其它用电设备。比如，低温蒸气泉的蒸气降温需要额外的电来冷凝到常温，这就是一个很好供电模块。

   要解决的另一个基本需求就是复制人的食物，每个复制人每周期需要 1000k cal 的能量。如果只种植米虱木
   （Mealwood），这可以说是最好种植的食用植物，只要在氧气/污染氧/二氧化碳 环境中保持 10~30°C 的
   环境温度，仅消耗泥土 10 kg/cycle，无需灌溉、光照就可以在 3 周期收获 600kcal 的米虱 1 单位。
   大概种植 5 棵米虱木就可以养活一个复制人，同时消耗泥土 50 kg/cycle。泥土可以从污染土转化而来，
   使用沙子、浮土过滤污染水后可以产生污染土，每个复制人大概可以产生污染土 468 g/cycle。


   由于游戏的逻辑实现基于“一格一物”原则，在电解水时排出的氧、氢两种气体会在一定条件下出现违反真实物理
   的“分离”现象，因为少量的氢气排出时也需要占据一格子，如果周围有其它氢或者真空的格子，就合并。类似地
   还有使用电动气闸的推动实现的高压气体，也是利用一格一物基本逻辑实现的。一格一物原理还可以用于分流，
   当气体管道中充满一种气体时，并且持续注入这种气体，那么就会堵塞其它气体，因为只有低密度的同类型气体
   才能合并到管道中。利用好流量控制阀就很容易实现这种违反真实物理的玩法。

   水泵、气泵可以作为抽真空的工具，并且在输出口也可能形成高压环境，输出端的环境处于高压状态时，会引起
   管道内的气体压力也在积蓄，在高于输出端环境压力时输出高压力气体。这点本身符合真实物理，但是高压气体
   的扩散过程与真实物理不同，它依然按“一格一物”的逻辑进行处理，所以是一个缓慢的扩散过程。气体、液体
   是“一格一物”原则的典型用法是用于造高压水库、气库。在同一个密闭空间中一种气体，会慢慢扩散开来，随着
   继续注入同样的气体，其密度就会增高，气压也就随之增加。高压液库也类似，只需要排液口所在格子被气体
   占据，那么液体就可以不断地排出，如果排液处于密封空间，这就会形成高压液库。

   “一格一物”是对同一概览图层中的游戏对象来说的，比如建筑各气体、液体等元素就分属不同的概览图层，它们
   可以在同一格中交叠。而砖块或者闸门等等与各种元素同层，因此机械闸门在一些缺氧模块设计中，利用来制造
   高压液库、气库。由于一格一物的约束，以及气体、液体按照密度高低分层堆叠的基本物理性质，可以用来在
   气泵所在位置制造“水门”以占据空间，避免其它气体跑到气泵本体所在的空间中。只需要两种不同密度的液体、
   并且少量不至于淹没气泵，就可以让气泵只能抽到没有被液体占据的其它公位置上的气体。同样的原理，也用
   在水解制氧的模块设计中，使用“水馒头”完全占据电解器的底部两格以及上面两格的部分，通过气推实现无需
   气体过滤器的氢、氧分离。

   电解器的判定格是水桶侧两格，如果这两格气体压力超过 1.8kg 就不会进行水解，并提示“已达最大气压”。
   但是如果使用“水馒头”覆盖这两格，就会判断气压正常，这应该是一个 BUG。只需要通过清瓶器滴两种液体，
   各 50g 少量即可以形成“水馒头”，它占据了电解器这个建筑所在的四格，又不使它牌淹没状态。只所以使用
   两种密度不同的液体，就是因为不同的液体占据不同格子，这样就可以分层完全占据电解器建筑所在的格子，
   最主要的是占据了释放气体的格子。在电解器工作时，释放的气体会在水立瓶的侧的瓶口所在格子出现，因为
   已经被液体占据，所以就会在四周查找可以使用的格子，这就是“液推”的功能。由于真空的格子有一个特性：
   连成片的真空，会被第一种气体完全占据。只需要给电解器的周边提供两个真空空间，它工作时释放的两种气体
   就会占据各自的空间，并且后续也会保持这种逻辑，自然地分离。由于稀疏的液体的存在，电解器在判定时，
   总是以为气体还没有到达最大气压，所以就可以持续不断地水解出氧气和氢气，从而形成高压气库。气库可以
   给太空服充氧，效率相当高。真空可以通过水池、水门、气泵等不同形式建立。真空空间一般使用透气砖分隔，
   并且将透气砖放置到电解器的出气格的水平方向或者上方。如不使用透气砖，那么“水馒头”的头部就会被气体
   推开，导致失效。


   气压是非常重要的游戏参数，对于复制人们而言，气压会在两方面上影响他们。一种是高气压造成的鼓膜破裂效果，
   另一种是可呼吸气体（氧气 氧气和污染氧 污染氧）的气压决定的可以呼吸度。可以呼吸度与可以呼吸气体气压的
   对应关系及其对复制人的影响如下表。

   气压的大小和气体的扩散会相互影响。一般来说，同种气体会从气压大的位置扩散到气压小的位置，而一种
   高压气体会“挤占”其附近的不同种低压气体的位置。当一种元素侵占原有元素所在的空间时，比如排气口、
   排液口，理解原来的元素如何扩散是制造气体、液体自动分离的基本原理。固体占据气体空间的情形对应电气闸，
   气体会按下、上、左、右次序逃逸，如果四周被固体围住，气体就会消失。电闸会先关闭电源端的一格，然后是
   另一格。利用这一特点就可以用电闸制作“吞气门”。

   如果使用液体围住气体的下、上、左、右，当使用其它元素占据气体所在格，气体就会向左上、右上两格逃逸，
   但不会向下侧方。可以使用游戏提供的调试模式测试，电解器在制氧时，会在水桶上方依次排出氧气、氢气。
   结合“气推”原理，就可以制作出不需要气体过滤器的氢氧自动分离模块。以上内容都是基于计算机数理逻辑
   进行的推演，是从游戏代码逻辑“一格一物”角度的分析。

   Thermal Conductivity https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Thermal_Conductivity

   本小节内容关于液体与气体，它们和固体最大的不同就是具有流动性，因此程序逻辑上的模拟也使用不同的
   算法。主要涉及热量交换、物质交换。游戏循环中最小热量交换计算时间单位为 tick = 0.2 秒，每秒钟
   5 ticks，这几个关键点用于计算各种物质的热交互。

   热量交换发生在所有相邻的物质之间，除了真空、虚空。物质交换只发生在液体、气体，固体是肯定不会发生。
   真空的温度是绝对零度，但它不能用作为冷却方法。因为真空没有物质，所以完全不导热，可以作为绝热体。

   所有物质的属性可以在游戏安装目录下的配置文件找到：

   *  气体属性文件： OxygenNotIncluded_Data/StreamingAssets/elements/gas.yaml
   *  液体属性文件： OxygenNotIncluded_Data/StreamingAssets/elements/liquid.yaml
   *  固体属性文件： OxygenNotIncluded_Data/StreamingAssets/elements/solid.yaml
   *  物质名称中英文对照： OxygenNotIncluded_Data/StreamingAssets/strings/strings_preinstalled_zh_klei.po

   游戏中的特殊元素：

        #. `复合物 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/zh/wiki/复合物>`__
        #. `真空 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum>`__
        #. `虚空 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Void>`__

   虚空是一种特殊的元素，可由调试模式生成，也可以在高旋星体（需修改游戏文件）中见到。虚空与太空暴露
   的方格类似，会吞噬流入的气体和液体。不同之处在于，虚空还会吞噬落入其中的不稳定固体（如雪、碎冰等），
   不会被流入的物质替代（与真空不同），而且不可通过修建干板墙来避免吞噬。与真空类似，复制人无法和虚空
   交互，但可以建造砖块覆盖它来消灭虚空。

   真空是一个没有任何固体、液体或气体占据的区域。显而易见，复制人无法在真空中呼吸。真空会被进入其中
   的气体、液体或固体方块替代。胃肠胀气或是穿着氧气面罩、喷气服的复制人很可能会破坏玩家构造的真空环境。
   自然状态下，真空可以由以下几种方式产生，包括自然形成和人工制造：

   *  在油质生态中，充满二氧化碳的空间可能会被浮油生物吸为真空；
   *  在砂岩生态中被铜矿和煤炭包围的地方自然生成；
   *  太空生态（太空暴露）可以制造真空；
   *  虚空可以制造真空；
   *  用气泵抽走封闭空间内的所有气体；
   *  将某一空间填满砖块，再使用水门等结构密封，复制人通过水门进入空间内部逐一拆除砖块。
   *  使用滴液大法，通过一格一物的“液推”原理，将所有气体往上推出将要制造真空的空间。

   发生物质交换时有几种情况：

   *  相邻格子有相同物质，相同气体或者相同液体，这种情况是一格一物的原则下的扩散/合并行为；

   *  相邻格子有不同的物质，但是可以被推开，与它相邻的同物质进行合并。这种情况需要满足物质容量
      上限条件才会发生。比如，配置文件设置水的单格最大容量是 1000kg，流动速度上限是 125kg。

   *  固体下落过程，会直接将下方的液体、气体相交换位置。

   物质的量是物理量，表示含有一定数目粒子的集合体，符号为 n。物质的量的单位为摩尔（mol）。科学上
   把含有阿伏伽德罗常数（约 6.02×10²³）个粒子的集体作为一个单位，叫摩尔。1 mol 不同物质中所含
   的粒子数是相同的，但由于不同粒子的质量不同，1mol不同物质的质量也不同。一般来说，不论什么物质，
   也不管它处于什么状态，随着温度、压力的变化，体积或密度也会发生相应的变化。

   游戏算法上，液体与固体、气体两者的明显区别是明显的分层流动现象，摩尔质量（molarMass）属性来决定
   液体的分层，当不同的液体位于相邻的上下位置时，摩尔质量高的物体会直接与交换到下格位置。液体交换直接
   生效，不像气体那样有一个缓慢的扩散过程，游戏中的气体流动系数（flow）都设置在 0.1 ~ 0.12。所以，
   气体只在较长的时间后才会出现明显分层，并且不同气体之间的边界不像液体那样有明显边界。

   液体滴落时就明显地发生上下格物质交换，利用液体这种算法就可以设计出“液滴泵”，可以用来给大空间抽真空，
   效率比气泵还高，也可以极低成本抽液体，甚至是用抽岩浆！液滴进入其它不同密度的液体时，会直接穿过比其
   密度小的液体，就像是固体一样往下沉。液体的密度远高于气体，不像气体那样在空间中扩散并且慢慢分出层次。
   游戏处理多种不同密度的液体时，更重的液体可以直接滴入并穿过密度较轻的液体，液体的分层速度大大快于气体。

   真空环境中，气体进入后会占满整个真空区域，而液体则不同，只占足够容纳液体本身的空间。但是液体蒸发
   形成蒸汽时就像一般的气体那样可以占据整个真空区域。

   液体的流动可以发生在竖直方向（VerticalFlow），也可以发生在水平方向（HorizontalFlow）。液体
   本身具有极小的可压缩性，一般情况下，最大质量（maxMass）参数决定了每格可以存放多少重量的液体，
   在受其它不同液体的挤压时，就按照压缩率（Compression）参数合并，比如受压的水每格可以在存放 1010kg。

   净水的流动速度（speed）最高为 125kg，只需要不到 40g 就可以形成一个“水馒头”（占据一格），达到 40g
   就会向两边扩散，达到 50g 就可以扩散到 3 格，扩散程度取决于环境。污染水密度比水重 2g，大概 80g 可以
   扩散 3 格左右。一般来讲，当一格液体的质量比某个方向向上不同的且相连的两格液体质量要大时，就会挤压并
   迫使这两格液体进行合并。液体、气体都存在挤压行为。

   游戏中原油（Crude Oil）是最重的液体，密度达到 500g/mol，它可以挂在顶壁上形成固态原油，也可以滴入
   水中变动液态原油。由于原油流动性较水差，需要 500g 左右才能向两边扩散到 3 格，如果油水混合，300g
   左右也可以。同样体积下，原油可能比水还轻。

   温度管理也是一个重要的内容，在游戏前期，由于没有热源，环境温度偏凉爽，但是后期随着各种电器、工厂
   的运行，热量会慢慢累积，如果管理不好，最直接的影响就是食物会停止生长，导致严重的后果。如果温度过高
   或过低，复制人会生病受伤、植物会停止生长并枯萎，其他物品则会损坏。环境会因为一些物品散发热量而变暖；
   热量会穿过墙，会在物资搬运中被逐步交换；就连复制人的存在都会产生并散发热量。同样地，寒意也可以通过
   热量的扩散和气体交换蔓延。掌握环境在游戏中至关重要。

   通俗地说，游戏中的“热量”是为了平衡两个物体的热能所传递的热的数量。使用“复制热每秒”单位衡量热的传递，
   Duplicant Temperature Unit per second，它和物理学中的焦耳每秒或者说瓦特是等价的，尽管它在游
   戏中不应和电能的瓦特混为一谈。游戏中并没有什么摩擦生热和电热的说法，所以对于热量的讨论应依附于特定的
   建筑进行。


   游戏中的部分热源：

   *  空间加热器 120 瓦电能产出 18k dtu/s 热量，但是它通常不值得利用，它唯一的增益是 +10 装饰。
   *  液体加热器 960 瓦电能产出 4064k dtu/s 热量，速度较慢，功率效率更高，可以作为中央加热系统的核心。
   *  电池、巨型电池在充电时产生 1.25k dtu/s 热量。它们体积较小、干净，产热时间也较短，是提供额外热量的好方法。
   *  低温蒸汽喷孔喷出 110°C 的蒸汽，它可以被冷却成水并泵到殖民地内，比如淋浴隔间（复制人不在意近乎烧开的洗澡水）。
   *  附近的生态可以提供或者吸收大量热量，生态在星球生成后不会维持自身的温度，所以这是一次性的热源。
   *  液温调节器和温度调节器可以往环境中释放大量热量并冷却其中的液/气体，将它们送往更热的地方吧！

   制冷中使用的冷却剂，如下，除了常见的水、污染水等，还有原油，通过蒸馏获取石油。另外超冷需要发射
   火箭后获取外星的稀有资源富勒烯，再通过分子熔炉（Molecular Forge）合成：

      90 kg Graphite + 5 kg Sulfur + 5 kg Aluminum       = 100 kg Fullerene
      1 kg Fullerene + 49.5 kg Gold + 49.5 kg Petroleum  = 100 kg Super Coolant

   设计管道热交换线路时注意，通风管和水管都有普通型、隔热型、导热热型，需要根据场合使用。特别是导热管，
   通常使用贵金属，成本比较高，只用在关键位置。注意，使用导热管用于获取冷量可能会导致冻坏爆管，这与造管
   使用什么材料无关，即使使用金制作的温度敏感形导热管道也一样会在液体产生想变时损坏，液体凝结、或气化。
   但是使用石油作为冷却剂，因为石油凝点是 -40 度，这样就可以获得水作为冷却剂时无法获得的零下温度。如果
   用于冷却冰霜小麦的灌溉用水，就需要使用石油作为冷却剂。使用金制造的高敏感温度传感器来控制液温调节器的
   工作状态。一个取巧的方法是让准备进入液温调节器的水刚好升温到 14°C，这样调节后的温度刚好是 0°C。

   管道模拟系统每秒使管道中的液体移动 1 格，单格液体管道的容量上限为 10 千克液体。换言之，单根管道的
   最大流速为 10 kg/s。液体在管道内流动不受重力影响。如果液体在管道内发生相变，液体管道会损坏（除非
   该格液体管道中的液体质量小于 1 千克）。气体管道类似，不过每秒流量为 1000 g/s。

   有多种方法可以直接利用热量：

   *  蒸汽涡轮机可以将 125°C 以上的蒸汽以每秒 2 千克的速度转化为电力，并冷却为 95°C 的水。
      假定温差为 100°C，吸热速度为 748.2k dut/s。能创造足够温差的情况下，这是最佳方式。
   *  复制人使用冰来运作冰冷风扇，以 32k dut/s 的速度冷却周围的空气。
   *  制冰机会移除原料水的 20% 的热量（并将其他热量释放至环境中）重新加热冰便可吸收热量。
   *  冰息萝卜在大多数气体环境下降温缓慢，而且不能大量生产，但是它不消耗任何能量。在理想条件下（高压纯氢环境）吸热速度为 12k dut/s
   *  将氢气通入反熵热量中和器可以达到 80k dut/s 的降温效果。

   控温设备基本使用：

   *  空间加热器：直接将环境中的气体加热到目标温度 70°C；
   *  液体加热器：直接将环境中的液体加热到目标温度 85°C，使用脉冲信号控制可以加热超过 100°C；
   *  温度调节器：输入任何气体并按冷却因子 -14°C 降温后输出，调节器自身升温并向环境散热；
   *  液温调节器：输入任何液体并按冷却因子 -14°C 降温后输出，调节器自身升温并向环境散热；

   使用一般材料制作的液温调节器过热温度为 125°C，如果使用钢制作就可以获得 200°C 的高过热温度。
   如果使用铌、导热质制作，那么还可以获得更高的过热温度，500°C 或者 900°C。利用高过热温度就可以
   用来加热水产生蒸汽来驱动蒸汽涡轮机发电。低温蒸汽喷孔是可持续的净水来源，它会喷出 110°C 的蒸汽，
   只要环境最大压力在 5 千克以内就可以在活跃周期持续喷发。低温蒸汽不能直接驱动蒸汽涡轮机，需要温度
   高于 125°C 的蒸汽。蒸汽涡轮机需要的蒸汽热量一般来自于岩浆或者液温调节器。蒸汽涡轮机作为十分有效
   的吞热设备，可以将高温蒸汽冷却为 95°C 的水。常用液温调节器的冷凝水去和低温蒸汽换热，一方面将热能
   转移到液温调节器的环境中用于生成高温蒸汽，另一方面将低温蒸汽冷凝为水，以降低温蒸汽喷孔的环境气压。
   温差越大发电功率越大，最大发电功率 850 瓦，配合电厂的电控站产生的增效芯片，可以提高到 1275 瓦。
   除了蒸汽喷孔的能量，一些高温的环境，也可以利用这样的方法利用热能，当然液体的比热容大、能量也更多。

   蒸汽涡轮机的发电功率方程，单位为瓦特：

      Power = Min( (85 / 21) * 蒸汽质量 * (蒸汽温度 - 95), 850) 

   蒸汽涡轮机的蒸汽吸入口可以被部分堵塞，不同情况下，为达到功率上限，所需要的蒸汽温度分别是：

   物质的热交互。当蒸汽涡轮机只有一个蒸汽吸入口时，该吸入口每 tick（0.2 秒）吸入 0.08 千克蒸汽。
   但蒸汽涡轮机需要储存 0.1 千克蒸汽才能开始工作，因而它每两个 tick 才会工作一个 tick，所以它的
   功率上限降为 425 瓦。为达到该功率上限，所需要的蒸汽温度是 357.5°C 不变。堵口不会影响到蒸汽涡
   轮机的产热和吞热。它们依旧会每秒吞掉 0.4 千克蒸汽的热量，并按照所吞热量的 10% + 4 千复制热/秒
   的效率产热。

   低温蒸汽泉 110℃ 的蒸汽，降温到 95℃ 和升温到 125℃，温度差都是 15℃，显然升温方案更节省能量。
   降温方案中，使用常温水通过水管交换热量就可以让 110°C 蒸气凝结为 65°C 以下的液态水。升温方案中，
   假定喷口蒸汽量 4kg/s 多一点，那么本身就支持大约 4 * 4 * 15 = 240w 的发电功率，再经过电控站
   加持就可以达到 360w 的发电功率。再加上一台液温调节器的换能，在蒸汽充足的情况下，完全可以做到 
   1000w 以上的发电功率。这需要使用两台蒸汽涡轮机，因为每台吸收蒸汽的速率是 2kg/s，需要两台才能及
   时消化喷口的蒸气，否则就会积压导致喷口效率下降。蒸汽本身提供热能回收后再用于冷却经过蒸汽涡轮机初步
   降温后的温水，可以降到 50°C 左右，至于要降低到多少度，取决于投入的电力。
   
   升温方案设计，使用两个蒸汽涡轮机和一个液温调节器处理一个 4kg/s 的低温蒸汽泉，喷孔上面放液温调节器，
   并且使用隔热砖围住作为蒸汽室，防止与外部换热降低蒸汽能量。最上面放置两个蒸汽涡轮机，两者路线正文摆放
   液温调节器，这样可以同时使用高温蒸汽驱动涡轮机。液体循环系统可以按三部分：

   *  集液部分：将蒸汽涡轮机的输出液与蒸汽室底部的液体收集（水泵抽取）到集液箱，集液箱可以通过信号输出
      控制抽到什么液位暂停；

   *  冷却循环：液温调节器对集液进行降温处理，产生热能升温喷出的蒸汽以达到蒸汽涡轮机的要求。使用水管
      温度传感判断液温是否冷却到合适温度，如果是就通过信号线控制液体开关阀将其放出到常温水池中。如果
      温度还太高，就通过液体管桥回流到液温调节器的输入端再次降温。使用液体管道温度传感器控制开关阀时，
      应该将传感器与开关阀串联，否则就应该在传感器所在的下一格设置开关阀，这样才能刚才让判定的液体流过。
      如果并联使用液体开关阀，那么就应该让管道经过其端点。否则即使在关闭状态，它也会缓冲一部分液体。
      在循环管道中，管桥起着限制液体流动方向的同时，还相当于驱动器，可以美其名称“永动机”。另外，管桥的
      主要作用是明确流向，程序算法需要它来为节点管道网络节点提供方向信息。对于在一段管道流动的物质，
      当它遇到管道桥的入口时就会进入管道桥所指引的方向，只有在这条路径堵塞后，才会流向后面的管道。多个
      管道桥出口接入到一段方向明确的主管道时，只有在主管道有空的管道时才能进入主管道。

   *  补水：当冷却循环中缺水（已经冷却好排出），就将集液箱中的水补充到冷却循环中。使用液体
      元素传感器、非门、液体开关阀控制，传感器检测液温调节器的输出端口大概 2~3 节点的水管处检测水是
      否存在。如果缺水，就会出现传感器检测不到水，输出红色信号，经非门反转为绿信号并打开开关阀给冷却
      循环补水。
   
   *  过热保护：当蒸汽不足，蒸汽室会被抽至接近真空，并且液温调节器会在缺少水蒸汽的情况下加热到超过
      过热温度。因此需要在其邻近处放置一个温度传感器，使用金元素制作以提高灵敏度，设备一个保护温度，
      比如 180℃。液温调节器应该使用钢以上的元素制造，以获得超过 300℃ 的过热温度。当然使用金汞齐
      制造也能获得 175℃ 的过热温度，但非常容易烧坏。另外，在无水可处理时，蒸气室会被抽到相当真空，
      这时温度传感器也不好用了，需要搭配气压传感器，通过与门与温度传感器一同控制液温调节器，以确定
      完全关闭液温调节器。
   
   *  喷孔休眠：喷孔喷发时会产生大量的热水，如果不能及时降温到合适温度，可以先使用储液罐临时保存。
      当喷孔进入休眠期再取出来浇到高温的液温调节器上制造蒸气，并继续冷却其它待处理的温水。这部分
      可以使用一个时间传感器来控制排水口定时地向液温调节器排水制造蒸汽。

   开关阀的两端其实就等价于两节水管，这是与液冷机这些设备不同之处。开关阀用好了，还可以当作低功耗的
   过滤器（Element Detector Filter），利用流量控制阀环流也可以实现过滤器功能。利用一格一物原理，
   可以使用砖块在竖直方向建立一个单格宽度的液体槽，两在横向上左右错开地开辟单格高的分流槽，就可以实现
   不同液体的分流。气体的分层不明显，由于程序算法上不同于液体，有扰动的现象，所以不能实现类似的分流。

   降温方案中，蒸汽发电系统主要是隔热砖包围的蒸汽室，它内部放置用于制造蒸汽的液温调节器，另外，为了防止
   热能流失，蒸汽喷孔和初步冷凝后的水（温度也较高）也需要使用隔热砖围起来。整个热交互流程为：液温调节器
   产生低温水，先给蒸汽涡轮机降温，再给喷口的蒸汽降温并使用蒸汽初步凝结为热水形成水池，然后冷凝水再与
   水池交换热量，最后回流到液温调节器。为了避免爆管问题，可以使用一般液体管道给喷口蒸汽降温，避免吸热
   过量导致管内发生气化相变，从而导致爆管。但是，蒸汽涡轮机和水池的冷却可以使用高导热的金属管。同时可以
   给水池放置一个温度传感器，水温降到正常温度时就可以关闭液温调节器，关闭整个蒸汽发电系统。蒸气涡轮机
   所发的电能只是回收一部分液冷机的消耗。除非通过电控站给蒸气涡轮机升级，否则整个系统没有富余电力输出，
   还要输入电力用于生产高温蒸汽。

   金属导热管在正常流速 10kg/s 下只需要 10 节就有非常好的热交换效果，但是使用液体桥和管道组成环流
   可以让导热管内的水与外界完成充分的换热，可以达到完全与环境温度一致。普通水管由于在高温环境，换热也快。
   并且主要是给喷孔处的蒸汽降温，使喷气周围压力降到 5kg 水平以下，这样才会有更多的蒸汽喷出。另外，
   蒸汽室中注入的水也不需要太多，太多只收的能量也多。考虑到蒸汽涡轮机 5 个孔总吸入速率为 2 千克/秒，
   只需要保证蒸汽室的平均每 5 格蒸汽密度大于这个值就可以。


   使用温度调节器可以利用气体快速让环境温度降到冰点，但是不不会像液温调节器那样需要考虑水的冰点，除非
   使用低凝固点的石油作为冷却剂。如果单用空气降温，考虑到建筑本身开始就含有一定的热量，所有需要一定的
   时间来降温。如果配合液温调节器，则会更快速达到冰霜小麦的种植环境要求。

   冰霜小麦的生长温度范围是 -55°C ~ 5°C，气压范围是 150g ~ 10kg，需要氧气、污染氧或者二氧化碳
   环境。野生冰霜小麦的生长周期是 72 周期。人工种植的冰霜小麦的生长周期是 18 周期，需要每周期灌溉
   20 千克水，并且施肥 5 千克泥土。

   冰霜小麦每次成长时可以收获 18 份冰霜麦粒，它不能直接食用，可以作为种子使用，也可以进一步加工
   成高价值食品：

   *  冰霜面包，标准[+2]，1200 千卡能量，需要 3 单位 冰霜麦粒 在 电动烤炉 中制作而成。燃气灶可深加工为冰霜汉堡。
   *  浆果糕， 良好[+3]，4000 千卡能量，好处是永不腐烂，需要 5 单位 冰霜麦粒 和 1 单位 毛刺浆果 在食物压制器制作。
   *  火椒面包，杰出[+5]，4000 千卡能量，需要 10 单位 冰霜麦粒 和 1 单位 火椒粒 在 燃气灶 中制作而成。
   *  混合浆果派，杰出[+5]，4200 千卡能量，需要 3 单位 冰霜麦粒 + 4 单位 虫果 + 1 单位 炙烤刺果 在 燃气灶 制作。
   *  冰霜汉堡，极佳[+6]，6000 千卡能量，这是最高级的食品之一，需要冰霜面包、海生菜、烤肉串各 1 单位 在 燃气灶 制作。
   *  作为对比，制作 1 单位 海陆双拼 Surf'n'Turf，优秀[+4]，6000 千卡能量，
      需要 1 单位 烤海鲜（帕库鱼片或生蟹肉 1600 千卡）+ 1 单位烤肉串（2 单位的肉 4000 千卡）在 电动烤炉 制作。

   复制人标准热量消耗为 1000 千卡每周期，所以平均每种值三株冰霜小麦就可以养好一个复制人。

   冰霜小麦的种植十分讲究环境温度控制，建议使用液培砖种植冰霜小麦。冰霜小麦需要灌溉的水会在 -3.65°C 
   结冰，其最高生长温度为 5°C，常用的方法有三种：

   *  使用液温调节器等方案降温输入的水，确保其在 0-5°C 之间，使用液温调节器较难实现。
   *  让低温泥浆喷泉/低温盐泥间歇泉的低温水经过铺设在冰霜小麦所在格的导热液体管道以实现降温。
   *  上一方案的进阶版本：冷却液循环流动，循环中加入液温调节器转移多余的热量（通常配合蒸汽室和蒸汽涡轮机使用）。
      此方案不必计算，理论上可以输入开水。冷却液建议使用污染水或盐水，浓盐水比热容下降而水有爆管风险故相对不推荐

   用气温调节器配合绝热水管浇灌，只要气温和液培砖保持在 5°C 以下，冰霜小麦就可以生长，水温要求就不高，
   使用常温净水就可以，它基本不会将热量传递给液培砖。另外，需要使用隔热砖建造的温室保护起来，防止与外部
   热量交换。另外，内部的气体密度会随着作物的生长面减小，需要及时补充空气。同时，高密度的空气也能提高
   温度调节器的制冷效率。

   使用隔热砖可以避免热量传递，在游戏早期，最好把热排放到不会引起麻烦的地方。较冷的生态（苔原、铁锈）
   可以用来排热，或者通过液体的热交换来达到冷却效果，也可以在较冷的生态处取水、气等资源。游戏中还设计
   了一种“冰息萝卜”物体，它吸热维护生命，保持自身低温。不可通过收获额外获取种子，可拔除后移栽。野生
   冰息萝卜冷却 250 克/秒的气体，人工种植的冰息萝卜冷却 1kg/s 的气体，将其温度降低 5°C 后顶部排出。
   冰息萝卜自重 400 千克，它可能会显著地减缓降温速率。存活温度 -90°C ↔ 190°C，生长温度 -60°C ↔ 95°C。
   https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/zh/wiki/冰息萝卜
   
   为了获取冰原中的冷量，也可以使用净水，但有前提是使用流量阀限制管道流量为总量的 10% 也就是 1kg/s
   的流量，这样即使管道中的水变成冰点以下，也不会爆管。

   使用液温调节器可以给液体降温，但是冰霜小麦需要净水，它的冰点在 -0.65°C，如果直接使用液温调节器，
   不能很好地控制输出 -5°C 以下的水温。因为净水经过液冷就会降温 14°C 左右，除非输入液体的温度刚好
   比这个温度高几度以内。如果不需严格的净水温度，可以使用储液箱和液体开关阀做一个小水池，通过储液箱
   的信号控制储水量。然后使用液温调节器给水池的水做循环降温处理，只能将水温控制在 0°C ~ 14°C 左右。
   液温调节器的两端并联一个液体管道桥，并且绿色的输出口对齐连接，且由管道桥引管到储液池和种植冰霜小麦
   的液培箱。这样就可以为液温调节器的绿色输出端提供一节管道的缓冲区、为管道桥的白色入口提供多节管道的
   缓冲区，防止堵管造成温度传感器的失效、误判，导致液温调节器输出冰点的液体引起焊管，也避免了因为液温
   调节器的输出拥堵而导致其它未进行降温处理的液体走向管道桥的旁路。

   另一个更好的方案是使用 -20.65°C 冷点的污染水，这样只需要建一个污水池，并且使用污染水作为冷却剂，
   可以将水池降温到冰点以下，使用金来制作管道在水池中交换热量，根据种植使得的用水量来设置水管的与水池
   中低温水的接触面，然后将降温后的净水引入温室灌溉作物。这个方法最方便做温度管理，不会因为净水作为
   冷却液时经常爆管且温度不达不到冰霜小麦的环境温度要求。液温调节器需要在入口处设置一个液体管道温度
   传感器，检测到低于 0°C 的污染水时就关闭液冷机，让冷却剂走并联的液体管道桥。这不仅是最节省材料，
   使用隔热砖建造冷水池又节能。这种方案只需要将低温水引入温室作为灌溉之用，只需要使用一个水管温度传感器
   和液体开关阀来保证灌溉水的温度即可，也可以方便地使用导热管来降低温室的空气温度。只不过前期需要消耗
   大量电来给水池降温，这些转换热能可以考虑使用蒸汽涡轮机收回，以名释放到空间导致空气被加热。还可以
   通过冰息萝卜所在的冰原采集低温的冰、污染冰，这样就可以减少电能的消耗。当然，制冷产生的热也可以用来
   种植火椒藤，或者生长在温盐水中的水草，它们需要高温环境，产出火椒粒、海生菜是高级食品原料，正好可以
   互补做成阴阳农场。

   因为水的比较容较大（TC = 4.179），越多的水热量就越多，为了尽量减少要进行降温处理的液体，可以考虑
   使用双液体分层结构，只需要在两格高的区间放入少量的密度不同的两种液体，就会按照一格一物原理自动形成
   水帘。然后液温调节器、灌溉水分别走一边，这样就可以快速达到目标制冷效果。
   
   使用隔热砖注意材料，普通砂石隔热效果比起沉积岩、陶瓷等材料肯定是有差别的。隔热质制作的普通砖并没有
   隔热效果，另外还可以抽真空绝热。游戏中最隔热、最坚硬的物质就是绝热体中子质（Neutronium，TC = 0）。
   隔热砖使用的材料依隔热效果从高到低为：

   隔热质 > 陶瓷 > 火成岩 > 砂岩、镁铁质岩 > 花岗岩 > 沉积、黑曜石 > 深渊晶石

   草率地用水管灌溉植物来排放多余热量并不好——不要用热水灌溉喜温凉作物（毛刺花等）。如果没有别的选择，
   使用隔热液体管道或通过阀门控制流量。（滞留在管道内的水会让你的基地迅速升温，它的比热相当高）或者
   你可以用导热液体管道通过较冷的区域预冷。在发展出液温调节器、暖通空调科技以后，就可以使用液温调节器
   和温度调节器来给液体、气体降温。注意，液温调节器需要在冷凝剂中运行，无法通过空气排出大量的热量，
   当其温度高于 125℃ 时就会损坏。

   液温调节器从流过的液体中吸收热量，使得液体流出液温调节器时，温度总会降低一定度数，除非其温度已经达到
   -272.15°C（1K）这一下限。此过程是热中性的（即液温调节器所获得的热量等于液体失去的热量），但液温
   调节器的耗电功率恒定为 1.2 千瓦，无论转移了多少热量——即便输入液体温度已经达到 -272.15°C。液温调
   节器散发的热量可以复利用，用来为蒸汽发电机烧水，熔炉产品或者金属精练排出液的温度也可以利用起来。

   液温调节器冷却因子 -14°C，这个值对于水的冷却来说，就是流出时的温度比流入的温度低 14°C。但是对于
   其实导热、比热容系数不同的液体来说，就有所差别，原油大概可以降低 10°C。虽然原油的导热好，但是比热容
   比水低太多。正常环境温度下使用，只需要用水淹没机器的底部两格就可以持续工作。

   因为管道中的物质出现相变时会导致爆管，比如典型的就是水变成冰，所以为了避免这种问题，可以配合温度
   传感器检测输出口的液体温度，确保其不出超出凝固点、升华点温度。

   另外，液温调节器本身工作温度也需要限制在 125°C，这需要将它放在可以速度吸引热量的环境中（冷却剂），
   直接放在地砖上或者用砖住就不是很好操作，因为空气、砂子的导热效率太低，如果机械持续地工作，其温度会
   很快地升高并超出工作温度，散热速度在几度每秒，但是升温可达 10°C 以上，所以很快就会烧坏机器。至少
   应该使用水作为冷却剂，那怕 10kg 垫底，也胜过用空气，虽然这么少的水不足以高效地吸机器的热量，但它
   至少起提高了与环境换热的效率，只要环境温度不是特别高，机器就可以控制在一个平衡的温度水平。稳妥点
   还需要在冷却剂中设置一个温度传感器来控制液温调节器的工作。


   另外，在种植、养殖场中，还可以使用液温调节器来获得合适的生物最佳生长温度环境。

   在吞热设施正常运行前，不建造“聚合物压塑器”或“金属精炼器”等高产热机器，而是喂养对应的小动物来获得产物。
   这在游戏早期没有时间和资源建造合适的房间、设备和其他隔热物前很重要。绝大部分材料都可以通过小动物获得。
   游戏早中期使用火成岩建设隔热的砖块和液/气体管道来运送/储存热流体，在后期则换用陶瓷和隔热质等材料，它们
   具有最低的热导率，可以有效隔绝温度传导。


Tutorial - Metal Volcano
------------------------

   铜火山是一座大型火山，定期喷发熔融铜，是典型的金属火山。与间歇泉类型，它也是可再生资源的一种，游戏中
   不同金属都有对应的火山喷发相应的液态金属物质。要开发好金属岩浆，最基本的方法就是将岩浆的热能与水交换
   产生蒸气驱动蒸汽涡轮机，用它来将热能转换为电能，同时获得降温后的固态精练金属。这就需要计算火山所喷发
   的岩浆流量、所蕴含的能量总量，然后再根据这些数据使用相应质量的水来建造蒸汽室，并驱动相应的蒸汽涡轮机。
   还可以配套使用轨道运输、清扫器，自动运输冷却好的金属块。

   高温火山开发的一般需要使用液温调节器来给

   比热容、导热率是物体做热交换时的重要参数，比热容影响获得、失去同一份热量时的温度变化。为了有热量管理
   有个基本认识，需要了解一些基本物质的热能相关属性：

   *  氧气的比热容 1.005 dtu/g/℃，
   *  沙子的比热容 0.830 dtu/g/℃，
   *  冰的比热容 2.050 dtu/g/℃，
   *  水的比热容 4.179 dtu/g/℃，
   *  水的比热容 1.005 dtu/g/℃，
   *  巨型电池 1.25dtu/s，
   *  智能电池 500 dtu/s，
   *  冰箱 500 dtu/s，
   *  金属精炼器 16k dtu/s，
   *  熔炉 20k dtu/s。

   瞬间相变（flaking）是一种让 5 千克的小质量固体或液体瞬间发生相变的机制。它需要在两个互相接触的
   砖块有足够高的温度差时实现，而且无需考虑各自的热传导机制。它由两种不完全相同但非常相似的机制构成：
   **闪熔**（固体瞬间融化为流体）和 **闪蒸**（液体瞬间蒸发为其它流体，包括液体和气体）。

   *  施体（Donor）：为瞬间相变提供热量的高温格。
   *  母体（Parent）：发生瞬间相变的一格物质。相变发生时物质会损失部分质量。
   *  子体（Child）：由母体相变而来的新的一格物质。

   对于闪熔和闪蒸，瞬间相变的发生有两种稍有区别的前置条件。不过对二者通用且最重要的条件是：

   *  在新计算出来的子体位置出现后，母体与施体的格子必须仍相邻。
   *  母体质量须大于 5 千克。
   *  母体的温度至少要低于相变温度 3°C。
   *  施体的温度至少要高于相变温度 3°C。结合上一条，这意味着施体至少要高于母体 6°C 的温度才能发生瞬间相变。

   子体将会以一个质量为 5 千克、温度恰比母体的相变温度（若母体为固体则是熔点，母体为液体则是沸点）高 3°C 的新方块出现。
   瞬间相变会在每个游戏刻内发生一次（一个游戏刻为 0.2 秒），这意味着你可以在任何一格上以 25 千克/秒的速度进行瞬间相变。

   相变包括物态变化，但同样物态的物质的互相转化也可称为相变，常见的有正常液态氦（氦Ⅰ）与超流氦（氦Ⅱ）
   之间的转变，奥氏体钢和马氏体钢的转变等。石油和原油的变化在实际生活中并非相变，不过在缺氧星球观内
   姑且可以理解为相变。参考 https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Flaking


   蒸汽涡轮机可以通过蒸汽将热能转化为电力。热量一般来自于岩浆或者液温调节器。蒸汽涡轮机是一种十分有效的
   吞热设备，能够持续从环境中将大量的热量转变为电力。蒸汽涡轮机在大多数的冷却装置中都十分重要。

   蒸汽涡轮机必须建筑在砖块之上，它的蒸汽吸入口穿过下方的砖块，吸入地基下方的蒸汽。每个蒸汽吸入口可以
   吸入 0.4 千克/秒蒸汽，当 5 个口全部工作时，总吸入量为 2 千克/秒蒸汽。蒸汽涡轮机输出的水量等同于
   吸入的蒸汽量，温度固定为 95°C。

   *  蒸汽涡轮机需要蒸汽温度达到 125°C。如果蒸汽温度不达标，蒸汽涡轮机会停止工作。
   *  蒸汽涡轮机本身温度必须小于 100°C，否则会停止工作。此特性和过热无关，也和材料无关。

   蒸汽涡轮机本身也是一个热源，它本身可承受过热温度 1000°C，氢气发电机、煤炭发电机过热温度是 75°C。
   所以，如果要这些发电设备共用同一个电厂中的电控站（加 50% 发电功率），那么就需要控制好降温措施。
   电厂内的发电机需要安装芯片来提升 50% 的功率，电厂内有未调整的发电机，则具有电气工程技能的复制人
   会前来制作微芯片，用于进行发电机的调整。每枚微芯片需要消耗 5 千克精炼金属。

   一个默认状态的复制人制作一枚微芯片需要 15 秒，用其调整发电机则需要 180 秒。施用时间受复制人的机械操作
   属性的影响，调整后的发电机会获得工程师的调整增益效果，发电功率提升 50%，持续时间 3 周期以上，有效时间
   随工程师的机械属性的增高而增加。


   火山或者间歇泉的基部一般是绝热的中子物质。为了使用热能不散失到环境中增加能量的管理难度（熵增），
   就需要使用隔热砖将火山开发模块包围起来。

   铜火山最大喷发压力 150 千克，熔岩累积超过这个量就会暂停喷发。熔岩产物为 2226.85°C 的熔融铜。
   多数铜火山喷发周期时长 556 ↔ 995 秒，喷发期产率 5 ↔ 19 千克/秒，单次喷发量 259 ↔ 538 千克，
   单周期喷发量 9011 ↔ 38969 千克，平均产率 200 ↔ 400 千克/周期。

   为了最大化获取资源，可以将熔岩引流到绝热池子，并通过耐高温物质将热量慢慢传递给水或者水蒸气，并利用
   合适数量的蒸汽涡轮机只收热能发电。

   假定铜火山单次喷发 300kg，那么从 2226.85°C 的熔融铜降温到 1083.85°C 的固态铜，再到常温，
   热能数量与物体的比热容有关，铜的比热容 SHC = 0.385，Specific Heat Capacity [(DTU/g)/°C]，
   每增减 1 (DTU/g)/°C 就需要 0.385j，每克超过 2000°C 多的温差就有超过 770j 的能量，那么对于
   流量为 400kg 的铜火山，每秒的喷发的熔岩所涉及的热能就有 308,000,000 焦耳，相当于 15400 个智能
   电池所存储的能量。

   水作为常用的热媒介，它的比热容 SHC = 4.179，相同的质量和温差参数下，热能是铜的 10.85 倍。因为
   水需要用来制造超出 125°C 的蒸汽，蒸汽涡轮机 5 个口全部工作时可以处理蒸汽为 2 千克/秒，只需要 200°C
   的蒸汽就可以达到最高发电功率 850w，输出相同质量的 95°C 液体，温差 200°C - 95°C = 105°C，消耗
   热量 877j/s。因此，假设将熔融铜每秒流量的熔岩降低到常温，就需要转换为 20 倍质量的水为 200°C 的
   蒸汽，假设熔岩流量为 400kg/s，也就是需要 8 吨水就可以一次处理完铜火山的热能。

   液体管道温度传感器常和液温调节器、液体开关阀配合，仅当液体加热完成、或冷却完成时允许液体通过。
   传感器能够检测当前所在格中液体管道内的液体温度，并输出自动化信号。玩家可以设定液体管道温度阈值，
   并选择在高于或是低于该温度时输出绿色信号。若液体管道没有内容物，那么检测的温度值保持为最后数据。

   要求开关阀后面的线路不堵，否则可能误判，误判还可能造成液温调节器输入的液体温度过度导致低温损害，
   液态水相变为固态的冰导致爆管。所以对于这种一般都是用管道桥实现白口循环接入绿口，白口同时再往外。
   注意，多个管道口的连接有串、并联两种接法：一个管道器通过管道连接到另一个管道口中就属于串连，如果
   管道都连接到某一管道上就是并联。首先需要明白，两种连接方式，当主管拥挤时，支管按液体流向从下游到
   上游支管进行排除运输，这是拥堵的基本处理逻辑。

   使用液体管道温度传感器和液温调节器配合做液冷时，传感器一定要紧接液冷机的白口的输入管道，用于及时
   在液温过低时关闭液温调节器，并让低温液体通过并联的管道桥跳过液冷机，保证液冷循环不堵死，同时为了
   防止因为管道拥塞造成误判，输入过冷液体到液温调节器造成爆管，管道桥在并联时，液冷机白口要经过两节
   管道再接管道桥的白口。这样就相当于有一个缓冲区，避免过冷液因为不能及时流向管道桥，导致后续常温的
   液体经过传感器时触发液冷机的启动动作，从而导致液冷机输入过冷液体引发误判的爆管。所以连接时，一般
   绿口对齐，并且从管道桥的绿口引出到循环管道，相当于给液冷机的输出提供了一节管道的缓冲，避免液冷机
   拥堵导致其它高温液体转而经过管道桥而错过降温处理。

   如果将管道桥这部分称为液冷循环的傍路，那么它相当于有 3 节管道缓冲空间，除了这部分，整个循环管道
   都可以注满液体，不会导致液冷循环管道的堵塞。



Tutorial - Foods
----------------


   游戏中复制人的食物来源很多，典型且易于获取的有：

   *  `米虱木 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Mealwood>`__
   *  `哈奇 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Hatch>`__
   *  `帕库鱼 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Pacu>`__
   *  训养 https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Ranching

   帕库鱼是一种水域小动物，不像哈奇那样具有攻击性，自然生成于湿地生态的污染水水域中。死亡后掉落 1000 千卡
   帕库鱼片。帕库鱼可以提升周围 1 格范围的装饰度。

   野生的帕库鱼遵循小动物行为模式，在不“拥挤”和“狭窄”的情况下会在死亡前下一个蛋。喂鱼器喂食约 10 周期
   内驯化。驯化后，帕库鱼的繁殖速率和代谢率都会提高，在快乐状态下每 1.5 周期产下一枚帕库鱼卵。

   *  野生、快乐的帕库鱼在 20 周期时会产卵，并在鱼卵刚好孵化时死亡。
   *  一只成年的野生帕库鱼可在 6.67 个周期后驯化，需要 45 千克的藻类或 6.67 份种子。
   *  通过使用自动化限制喂食器，可以使用更少的藻类驯化帕库鱼。
   *  鱼卵会保留上一代的野性。
   *  帕库鱼苗只会在只含种子的喂鱼器中进食一次。

   游戏存在 bug，点击水体中的帕库鱼并“显示可行路径”，可能没有任何白色线条指示可行路径，这种情况
   很常见，可以保存游戏进度再重新加载后，可以解决帕库鱼因为不能游动 bug 导致不能进食的问题。

   米虱木（Mealwood）可以说是最好种植的食用植物，基本上只要保持 10 °C ~ 30 °C 的环境温度，使用泥土
   而无需灌溉、光照就可以有收获，大范围的适应气压 150 克 ↔ 10 千克。对应好养的小动物是“好吃哈奇”，
   好吃哈奇是一种杂食性的陆生小动物，可以吃砂岩生态中的沙子、砂岩、粘土、碎岩、泥土等等一堆的东西，当然也
   包含复制人可以吃的食物。对应的产出物是煤炭，还有可食用的肉、蛋。舒适范围 10°C ~ 20°C，存活范围 
   -30°C ~ 70°C，需求空间 12 格。在生存难度（默认设置）下，复制人每周期需要 1000 千卡食物。无论何时
   或因何而死，好吃哈奇死亡时总会掉落 2000 克（即 3200 千卡）肉，可以烤成 4000 千卡烤肉串。哈奇现有
   4 个变种，习性和用途稍有差别：

   1. 好吃哈奇 Hatch
   2. 草质哈奇 Sage Hatch
   3. 石壳哈奇 Stone Hatch
   4. 光滑哈奇 Smooth Hatch
   5. 黄金哈奇 Gold Hatch

   其中好吃哈奇、草质哈奇、石壳哈奇进食后产出煤炭，是殖民地煤炭的主要来源之一；光滑哈奇、黄金进食后产出
   对应的精炼金属、金子或金矿，是一种通过非工业途径获取精炼金属的方式。所有好吃哈奇都会在其 1 格砖块范围
   内提供 +10 的装饰度加成。哈奇的基本行为模式：

   *  成年哈奇在受到攻击时会进行反击，而幼崽则不会。
   *  陆生动物，并且会因一定时间内持续处于溺水状态而死亡，此时提示为“这只小动物无法在液体中呼吸！”。
   *  幼崽跟成年后的习性恰好相反：幼崽白天活动，夜晚睡觉。而成年则昼伏夜出，白天钻入硬度小于或等于 20 的自然方块，
      夜晚出来活动。无法钻入人造砖块以及硬度大于 20 的自然方块，如果运动路径上没有可钻入点，它们也会一直保持活动。

   野生和放养是最原始的，虽然也可以有收获，但是使用照料站建立的畜舍进行自动化养殖才是最省事也最高效的方式。
   猎杀散养哈奇，可以先捆绑哈奇再攻击，就可以避免受到伤害。被捆绑的小动物是无法还击的。小动物被捆绑之后，
   超过一定时间没人来搬运他，会自己挣脱游戏中搬运物体的操作有点让人迷惑，搬运到指定位置需要使用储物箱和
   清理操作相配合，先设置储物箱可以接收的物体类型，再使“清理” 功能点击要搬运的物体，小动物的搬运则需要
   配合“小动物放生点”而不是储物箱。

   草质哈奇消化食物能产出与食物同等质量的煤炭，煤炭转换率高达 100%，而好吃哈奇消化食物时煤炭转换率为 75%。
   然而实际上由于食物的能量密度（每千克物质可提供的能量）很高，用食物饲喂时草质哈奇/好吃哈奇的食量会大大降低，
   导致每周期产出煤炭的量也随之大减，只有最大产量的 0.1% 到 1% 。以产出煤炭为目标的话，不应以食物为饲料。
   成年好吃哈奇可以跳 2 格高或跨过 1 格宽的间隔，但好吃哈奇幼崽却无法跳跃，所以好吃哈奇幼崽常常会淹死。
   而自动化养殖中，常使用 1 格深的液体来杀死哈奇以获可食用的肉。但是使用高温是更快速杀死哈奇的方式，只要
   体温超出存活范围时会马上死亡并掉落肉。比如，使用岩浆加热可以快速杀死好吃哈奇，速度是溺水 3 倍以上。当然，
   让小动物老死也是一个选择。

   光滑哈奇最坚硬，生命值高达 400，攻击它可能会使复制人受重伤。先捆绑光滑哈奇再攻击，就不会受到伤害。

   哈奇种群繁殖：

   *  哈奇蛋自然孵化需要 20 个周期，而使用孵化器孵化需要 5 个周期。
   *  畜舍最大 96 格，平均每只好吃哈奇 12 格才不会拥挤，否则会降低代谢和产蛋效率，最佳容纳 8 只。
   *  哈奇蛋也需要占用空间，为了避免畜舍中的好吃哈奇因狭窄而中止产蛋进度，产下的蛋需要及时转移到畜舍外。
   *  孵化后的好吃哈奇幼崽不需要照料，会在 5 个周期后成年。
   *  已驯化的好吃哈奇所产的后代必然是已驯化的。
   *  通常情况下 8 只好吃哈奇的产出可供 1 台煤炭发电机发电，并持续持续驱动 2 个孵化器有余。
      而且当复制人使用孵化器完成对蛋唱歌的任务后，还可以断开孵化器的电源而不影响好吃哈奇蛋的摇篮曲状态，
      因此在游戏早期可以通过手动开关孵化器来省电。
   *  年老（年龄大于 95 周期）的好吃哈奇往往不能在自然死亡前产蛋，可以提前屠宰获取肉。

Cycles 游戏周期
--------------



   **Cycles** are the term used for the day/night cycle in `Oxygen Not Included`_. 
   One cycle lasts 600 seconds in total, with 525 seconds of daytime and 75 seconds 
   of nighttime. The slowly rotating asteroid image in the top left of the UI represents 
   the clock.

Daytime
~~~~~~~

   The brighter side of the asteroid represents daytime. `Duplicants`_ will usually 
   perform jobs and other actions during daytime.

   The sun shining on the Asteroid starts with dawn at 0 Lux, decelerating the closer 
   it gets to midday and 79.999 Lux and past midday accelerates the closer it gets 
   to 0 Lux, reaching it when Nighttime starts.


Night-time
~~~~~~~~~~

   The darker side of the asteroid represents nighttime and is when `Duplicants`_ will 
   usually go to sleep. Red alert prevents Duplicants from sleeping.

   `Hatches`_ are night active creatures and will look for food. At the end of the night 
   they will try to find some natural tile to dig in.

   During night-time, a Duplicant with the Night Owl `trait`_ will find most of their 
   skills increase by 3.

   No sun shines on the asteroid during nighttime, `Solar Panels`_ will not work.


Sleep
~~~~~

   Sleeping restores Duplicant's stamina. Duplicants do not need a full night sleep to 
   restore full stamina. Hunger, `light`_ and full bladder cause "interrupted sleep". 
   `Flatulent`_ and `Loud Sleeper`_ Duplicants can wake others up, too. Sleep interruption 
   annoys Duplicants during the following daytime and adds to their `Stress`_, in addition 
   if their stamina runs out during the work-shift they might fall asleep right on the 
   spot, interrupting their duties and receiving all relevant `morale`_ penalties.


Schedule
~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/2/22/Schedule.png

      Schedule Table

   In the "Schedule" menu one can see the current Schedule of each Duplicant and modify 
   it, add and delete new Schedules, rename Schedules, toggle sound notifications and
   move Duplicants to Schedules by clicking on the arrow.

   There are 24 blocks with each block representing 25 seconds. Those can be switched 
   to Bathtime, Work, Downtime and Bedtime.

   The Default Schedule is 1 Block of Bathtime, starting at dawn, followed by 18 blocks 
   of Work and 2 Blocks of Downtime are scheduled before the 3 Blocks of Bedtime.

   -  During **Work**, Duplicants will focus on accomplishing their tasks, only eating 
      and using the bathroom when absolutely necessary.

   -  During **Bathtime**, Duplicants will prioritize Bathroom activities at >40% 
      Bladder and work otherwise.

      Duplicants will need to use bathroom at least once per cycle. If bathtime/downtime 
      is spaced out by 10 blocks it will increase to two times. Since sanitary buildings 
      are communal, Bathtime is the prime candidate for splitting schedules to normalize 
      peak load.

   -  During **Downtime**, Duplicants will prioritize visiting the bathroom (>40% Bladder), 
      eating (when below 3300 kcal) and leisure activities. Each bonus Downtime slot besides 
      the first one increases `Morale`_ by 1, up to +4. If the duplicant isn't hungry, has 
      an empty bladder, has no recreation tasks and has no recreation room or Printing Pod 
      to idle by, the duplicant will choose to work during their downtime.

   -  During **Bedtime**, Duplicants will sleep and nothing else matters, unless it is 
      `really really important`_. Namely only because of a bursting Bladder, low `Oxygen`_ 
      or due to Starvation (less than 1000 kcal) they will get up.

      Duplicants normally lose only 70% of stamina per cycle and recover 38.75-42.9% per 
      block while sleeping in a `cot`_ (~43-51% in a `Comfy Bed`_), and the Barracks or 
      Bedroom `rooms`_ further speed up the stamina recovery.

      If a duplicant hasn't reached 100% stamina by the end of Bedtime, they will continue 
      sleeping until they reach 100% stamina through Work and Bathtime blocks, but not 
      Downtime. So with a short Bedtime and Work or Bathtime after sleeping, as long as 
      duplicants reach their bed by the end of Bedtime, they will continue sleeping and 
      only wake up once stamina has recovered to 100%.

   The Schedule can be free adjusted to deal with Loud Sleepers, Night Owls, Early Birds, 
   objects with limited interaction slots, too limited downtime to do everything needed, 
   less than three blocks being needed for sleep and hunting for `Hatches`_.


Early Bird and Night Owl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   -  During 3 rightmost blocks duplicants with Night Owl `trait`_ gain +3 to all `attributes`_.
   -  During 5 leftmost blocks duplicants with Early Bird gain +2 to all attributes.
   -  The bonus productivity time can be lost while traveling to and from bedrooms, 
      so it may help to buffer these schedules with an additional work block on either side.


Timings
~~~~~~~

   The whole day in Oxygen Not Included lasts 10 minutes (600 seconds) at normal speed, 
   with 1 minute and 15 seconds being nighttime.

   From experiments with batteries, power consumers and timer sensors, the game engine 
   appears to evaluate 5 ticks per second.

   Speed controls switches are 1x, 2x, and 3x speed, and `debug`_ super-speed value is 10x.


Achievements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are two cycle-based `Achievements`_:

   -  Turn of the century: Unlocked at cycle 100
   -  One Year, to be Exact: Unlocked at cycle 365.25

   Some other achievements have cycles as one criterion, e.g. for the *Home Sweet Home* 
   achievement, at least 200 cycles need to pass, while the *Carnivore* achievement 
   needs to be reached before the 100th cycle.

   -  Pufts, Gassy Moos, and Grubgrubs (Spaced Out) all have the highest 
      Minimum Space Requirement (16 tiles), so fewer can fit in one room at a time.
   -  Cuddle Pips have the smallest Minimum Space Requirement (4 tiles, four times 
      less than a Puft), so many can comfortably live in the same room.

植物属性表
--------

   -  `植物 <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Plant>`__
   -  `Plant/Plant comparison <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Plant/Plant_comparison>`__

   植物按用途分为以下几类：

   -  2.1 Decorative Plants
   -  2.2 Food Plants
   -  2.3 Industrial Plants
   -  2.4 Utility Plants

   不同植物需要满足的生长条件不尽相同，只有当所有条件都满足时，植物才能正常生长，否则会暂停生长甚至死亡。
   人工栽培的作物往往还需要灌溉和施肥，各种条件说明如下：

   -  温度 **Temperature**: Plants only grow in a range of temperature which is 
      related to the biome where you find them. Whatever this range is, all plants 
      like the conditions which are acceptable for your duplicants and can be 
      tended without Exosuits. Plant temperature can be directly inspected and 
      may take some time to match the environment.
   -  空气 **Atmosphere**: Some plants can grow in any atmosphere while others 
      need specific gasses such as Carbon Dioxide or Chlorine.
   -  气压 **Pressure**: Most of the plants require at least 150g of pressure to grow.
   -  光照 **Illumination**: Some plants prefer a strong light source, while others enjoy soothing darkness.
   -  灌溉和施肥 **Fertilization**: Productive plants typically require some combination 
      of liquid or solid resources to continue growing. Hydroponic Farms and 
      Auto-Sweeper be useful for these tasks.

   Failure to meet any requirement will cause a plant to become *stifled* and 
   become wilted. Stifled plants will stop growing and consuming resources. They 
   are otherwise unharmed and will resume normal growth after their needs are met.

   Ripe plants will continue to draw resources before harvest. They will automatically 
   drop their product after four cycles and begin anew.

   特别地，掩埋的淤泥根 掩埋的淤泥根、六角根 六角根、沼泽甜菜 沼泽甜菜生成时已经是可以收获的状态，而
   收获时即被拔除（相当于死亡）。植物在砍掉或者连根拔除时，总是产生种子（包手块根），工业用途的植物在
   收获时还有至少 10% 机会掉落种子。具体概率为 10% + 3.3% × 复制人的农业属性值，可以做到 100%。

   Plants always produce a seed when uprooted or killed. For food and industrial 
   plants there is a base 10% chance that a seed is produced once every harvest, 
   though there is an additional 3.3% chance per level of Agriculture (attribute), 
   including skill bonuses, so with 20 Farming the chance is 76%. More bonus levels 
   of agriculture can increase the chance to 100%.

   Each seed weighs 1 kg.

   植株变异（Plant Mutation）是眼冒金星（Spaced Out!）DLC 引入了辐射机制后增加的功能。辐射会使
   原始（未变异）的植物在收获时掉落的种子以一定概率发生变异，且经过植物分析仪 植物分析仪分析辨明后这些
   变异种子长成的变异植株会具有额外的特质。

   已变异的植物需要一定量辐射维持正常生长，且均为不育个体，收获时不会再额外掉落种子。

   Radiation, introduced in the Spaced Out! DLC, can mutate *seeds* to give a plant 
   additional traits, yet mutated plants are themselves infertile and don't drop seeds. 
   The chance of getting mutated seeds is equal to (the radiation on the plant / max 
   radiation the plant can handle) \* 80%, and is checked only at the time of harvest. 
   Plants therefore only need radiation right before being harvested.

   These mutated Seeds need to be analyzed in a ``Botanical Analyzer`` before they 
   can be used, even if that type of mutation is already known.

   \*\ Mealwood can be Licey, therefore doubling its yield Juicyfruit is good for 
   automated farms, but is only fertilizer-efficient for plants that have a growth 
   period of less than 16 days, since regularly they need 16+4=20 days of fertilizer,
   but with Juicyfruit they need 16*1,25 = 20.

   -  Only Nosh Sprout and Sleet Wheat take longer to cultivate.

   Game Mechanics are the rules that govern how the game works. While some mechanics 
   are grounded in real-life physics, Oxygen Not Included is only a game with a 
   limited simulation. In particular, the simulation only loosely respects conservation 
   of energy.

   **This article may need cleanup to meet quality standards.**

   *Oxygen Not Included* makes heavy use of (approximated) physics; as a result, 
   the game involves a number of **units** that may be confusing to the layperson.

   Note: ONI does not fully ensure the conservation of energy or mass and runs 
   quite limited `simulations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simulation>`__ with 
   a lot of hard-coded transitions. For example, a `Space Heater`_ will consume 
   120 watts of electricity, but can generate 18 kDTU/s of heat - which is equivalent 
   to 18,000 watts! This humble heating coil is operating at 150x efficiency.

Base Units
~~~~~~~~~~


Energy
''''''


   **Energy** is the capacity to perform work. For example, `coal`_ contains a large 
   amount of energy, which can be released by burning it in a `coal generator`_.

   The standard unit of energy is the **Joule** (J).

Mass
''''


   **Mass** is a measure of how much matter something contains.

   The standard unit of mass is a **Kilogram** (kg) which is 1,000 **Grams** (g).

   -  **Ton** or *tonne* (t) is 1,000 kilograms, or 1 million grams.
   -  **Milligram** (mg) is 1/1000 of a gram.
   -  **Microgram** (mcg or μg) is 1/1000000 of a gram. Not to be confused with 
      millicentigram (an unofficial unit).

Temperature
'''''''''''


   **Temperature** is a measure of the thermal energy content of a medium. Adding 
   heat raises temperature; removing heat lowers temperature.

   The standard temperature scale is **Celsius** (°C), with 0 degrees set at about 
   the freezing point of water (in earth-normal conditions). **Kelvin** (K) is an 
   absolute temperature scale, meaning that 0 is the coldest temperature possible. 
   0°C = 273.15 kelvin. The game, however, accepts temperatures above but not equal 
   to 0 K. A temperature difference of 1°C is the same as that of 1 K. **Fahrenheit** 
   (°F) is an alternative scale where 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F, so temperature 
   differences of 1°C = 1.8°F.

   Formulas for temperature conversion are as follows:

      K − 273.15 = C (e.g. 0K − 273.15 = -273.1°C (absolute zero))

      (F − 32) × 5/9 = C (e.g. (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C 
      (freezing temperature of water at 1 atm (101.325 kPa)))

Volume
''''''


   **Volume** is a measure of how much space something takes up.

   The standard unit of volume is the **cubic meter** (m³).

Time
''''

   *ONI* makes use of two time units: the second (s) and the day-night `cycle`_ (600 seconds).


Derived Units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Density
'''''''


   **Density** is a measure of how much mass a given volume of something contains. 
   Denser materials are perceived as being heavier.

   Density is measured in **kilograms per meter cubed** (kg/m³).

   *ONI's* implementation of density is limited to `liquid`_ and `gas`_ layering, 
   and is not relevant to anything else. Items will not float regardless of involved densities.

Power
'''''


   **Power** is a measure of how much energy is being expended per second.

   The standard unit of power is the **watt** (W), which is one **joule per second** (J/s).

   A machine that consumes 100 watts will drain 100 joules from a `battery`_ per second, 
   so a fully charged battery (containing 10 kJ) will power that machine for 100 seconds.

Heat
''''


   **Heat** is a measure of thermal energy measured in **Duplicant Temperature Unit** (DTU). 
   Heat production is measured in DTU/s. In the game, we usually see it in increments of 
   1000 (i.e., kDTU/s).

   As implied by the Specific Heat and other materials data, the DTU is equivalent to 
   the Joule (J) above. However, the game does not care about the conservation of energy 
   between its heat, electrical, and food forms, so this knowledge has no in-game bearing.

Specific Heat / Heat Capacity
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


   **Specific heat** describes how much energy it takes to heat something up.

   Specific heat is measured in **DTU per gram per degree Celsius** ( (DTU/g) / °C ).

   `Water`_ has a relatively high specific heat of 4.179 (DTU/g)/°C, meaning that 
   heating one gram of water by one degree Celsius requires 4.179 DTU.


Thermal Conductivity
''''''''''''''''''''

   Main article: `Thermal Conductivity`_

   **Thermal conductivity** measures how effectively heat can move through a substance. 
   A low value indicates a good insulator; a high value indicates a good conductor.

   Thermal conductivity is measured in **DTU per meter-second per degree Celsius** 
   ( (DTU/(m*s)) / °C ). Since one DTU per second is a watt, this can also be written 
   as **watts per meter per degree Celsius** ( (W/m) / °C ).

   `Abyssalite`_ is an extremely good insulator, with a thermal conductivity of only 
   0.00001. Therefore, if there is a temperature differential of one degree Celsius 
   across one meter of abyssalite, only 0.00001 DTU will flow across it per second.


Food energy
'''''''''''

   The amount of food energy is measured in **Calories** (kcal). A Duplicant eats 
   1000 kcals per day by default. See Guide/Food and `Food (Resource)`_.

   A further derived unit is the energy density, **Calories per kilogram** (kcal/kg). 
   This measures how many Calories a food has per kilogram.

   As with the real-life unit, the uppercase C specifies the larger unit that is 1000 
   times of the smaller calorie (cal). A cal is the same as the energy required to 
   heat one gram of water by one degree Celsius (4.18 DTU or 4.18 real-life Joules), 
   but again this has no in-game meaning.

Radiation
'''''''''


   The amount of `Radiation`_ a Duplicant absorbed is measured in 
   `Rads <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad_(unit)>`__.

   The strength of a Radioactive Field is measured in **Rads per cycle**.

   Further derived, and besides other sources, such as space, Radiation is created 
   `Radioactive Contaminants`_ in an amount of 1 Rad per Cycle per 1000 Contaminants.


Implied Quantities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Pressure
''''''''


   *ONI* does not handle `Atmospheric Pressure`_ as a separate unit. Instead, 
   the mass of gases in a tile is given.

   For those curious about a real-life equivalent, the only unknown needed is 
   the volume of a tile. Using a cubic meter yields reasonable results, such as 
   showing that the 1800g limit is about 5 atmospheric pressures of oxygen under 
   "room" temperature.


Trivia
''''''


   -  Watts per meter per degree Celcius ((W/m)/°C) was the unit of thermal 
      conductivity before the thermal unit was changed from watts to DTU/s.

   -  Heat power used to be measured in watts, but the units have changed to 
      DTU/s. 1 watt is equal to 1 DTU/s.

   Due to the nature of the game and its high complexity, there are many mechanics
   that were not intended by the developers but may be used by the player. Many of
   these behaviors are debated as to how much is considered "fair game", but it is
   ultimately up to the player to decide.

   Generally, these mechanics are broken down into two main categories: Unusual
   Behaviors and were put there intentionally by developers for simplicity or
   easy-of-use, and the other is Exploits, which utilize a quirk or bug in a 
   system (or interactions between systems).

Unusual Behaviors
-----------------

   Many systems in the game are designed with certain simplifications, either for
   the player or the developers. Some of these simplifications can be practical if
   intentionally utilized.

Heat Deletion/Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Many buildings in game have either a minimum or fixed temperature for outputs,
   meaning the heat energy of the inputs can be changed without other outside
   energy.

   Some examples include:

   -  Composts`_ output `Dirt`_ at a fixed 75°C, no matter the temperature of the 
      `Polluted Dirt`_ that was used for the composting process. Since Polluted 
      Dirt can go up to 1712.85°C, the compost can theoretically delete 135.9 kDTU/s. 
      Like `Refrigerators`_, their internal temperature is at a fixed value that 
      exchanges heat with the stored items to help them destroy germs.

   -  Buildings like the `Water Sieve`_ and `Electrolyzer`_ (and many others) have 
      a minimum output temperature and will add free heat if inputs are below it.


10% of pipe capacity avoids state change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/9/9d/Supercooled_water.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 80px
      
      An example of a super-cooled 1kg water packet in a pipe.

   Packets of up to 10% of a pipe's capacity (1kg for liquids, 100g for gases) will
   not change state regardless of temperature.

   This can be used to transport liquid and gas without worrying about temperature,
   and super-cool or super-heat them in pipes. When exiting the pipe, the liquid or
   gas will change state according to its temperature without breaking anything.
   Special care should be taken not to merge super-cooled or super-heated packets
   packets with others, as this can break the pipes.

   This is an intended albeit surprising mechanic that was specifically coded.

Petroleum/Sour Gas from an Oil Well
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Original thread`_ • `Petroleum Well setup`_

   `Oil Wells`_ have a minimum output temperature of 90°C, but no maximum output 
   temperature.

   Common sense would dictate that you can only have up to 100°C `Water`_ temperature, 
   but by restricting pipes to 1kg/s input water to as high a temperature as you want. 
   The 10% pipe limit of 1kg/s exactly matches the Oil Well requirement.

   When fed super-heated water, the Oil Well's outputted `Crude Oil`_ will match its 
   temperature. If it is hot enough, it will immediately change into `Petroleum`_, 
   then into `Sour Gas`_, creating heat in the process due to the SHC difference
   between `Water`_ and `Crude Oil`_.

Steam Turbine cooling via its foundation tiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/f/f8/Water_cooler.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 79px

      A Water cooler via a Steam Turbine cooled with its foundation tiles.

   `Original thread`_

   A `Steam Turbines`_ exchanges its building temperature with its foundation tiles 
   (the tiles it's sitting on).

   Most of the time, those tiles should be `Insulated Tiles`_ to avoid exchanging 
   heat with the `Steam`_ below it.

   On the other hand, the left-most and/or right-most tiles can be made out of
   heat-conductive material (`Diamond`_ `Window Tile`_ or `Metal Tile`_), because 
   heat does not conduct diagonally.

   Since those materials' `Thermal Conductivity`_ is much higher than any gas, 
   one tile can be enough to cool a Turbine when using active cooling.

Building construction temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   With a few exceptions, a building's temperature is clamped between 15°C and 45°C
   when constructed. This means massive amounts of heat can be deleted by using
   materials well over 45°C and created by using materials well under 15°C, at the
   cost of player interaction and Duplicant labor.

   A notable exception is buildings made from frozen substances, in which case the
   lower 15°C temperature limit is not applied. This allows the `Ice Block`_ to be 
   built without immediately melting. This exception applies to nearly all materials 
   that are liquid in the 15-45 C range, except `Solid Visco-Gel`_, which will result 
   in the building immediately melting.

Building Heat Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Buildings, referring here to all buildings that are not some form of `Tile`_, 
   have only 1/5th the heat capacity of their materials. This is not indicated 
   anywhere in-game. Effectively, this means 1 DTU will change the temperature 
   of a building 5x more than it would the same mass of tile or debris.

   This has numerous ramifications. For example, an 800 kg `Tempshift Plate`_ 
   effectively only offers 160 kg of thermal mass, less than that of a `Tile`_. 
   It also means that buildings that produce large amounts of heat such as 
   Aquatuners and Polymer Presses heat up very quickly.

   This can be deliberately exploited by melting buildings or deconstructing them
   after they have changed temperature, as the resulting liquid or debris will
   retain the original building temperature. This effectively multiplies all heat
   inputted to the building by 5x. This is why `Ice Tempshift Plates`_ are a good 
   way to melt ice, but also a poor way to cool down an area. This also makes makes 
   `building melting exploits`_ dramatically more effective.

Debris formation manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/7/76/Debris_formation_locations.gif
      :width: 180px
      :height: 255px

      Debris formation cells priority


   When a liquid freezes into a debris, the debris will try to form in the cell the
   liquid froze in.

   By placing a `Mesh Tile`_ at that position, the debris will to
   try form on all 8 tiles around that tile, following the order: Up, Down, Right,
   Left, Up-right, Down-right, Up-left, Down-left. If none of those is available,
   the debris will be trapped into the Mesh Tile. Any solid tile, or other mesh
   tiles, can be used to prevent a debris from forming in those 8 locations.

   This allows separating liquid and debris thermally, as well as having the debris
   form in a different room than the liquid, making, for example,
   `Magma`_ and solidified `Igneous Rock`_ much
   easier to handle.

   *When a debris is melted into another solid, it does not follow the same rule and
   instead try to form a tile at the position it's melted, then try all cells
   upwards until the top of the map, without trying any other adjacent cell.*

Technical Exploits
------------------

   Many mechanics are derived from how systems in the game are implemented in a
   technical sense. These are generally stable and not likely to change.

Doors as floors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/a/ad/Door_as_floor.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 205px

      Debris falls through the door, but Duplicants and Critters can walk on it.

   `Pneumatic Doors`_ can serve as floors that `Duplicants`_ and `Critters`_ are able 
   to walk on, but let items and debris fall through, unlike `Airflow`_ or `Mesh Tiles`_. 
   However, buildings that require a foundation cannot be built on top of them.

   This is an unintended feature that arose through the related mechanics.

Airlock doors as foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Manual Airlock`_ and `Mechanized Airlock`_ can be used as a foundation for a building
   when closed, and disable it when open. This can be used to automate enabling and
   disabling a building with no automation input port by placing it on top of a
   Mechanized Airlock and controlling it via automation.

   For example:

   -  A `Wheezewort`_ in a `Planter Box`_ can be controlled via a `Thermo Sensor`_.
   -  An `Anti Entropy Thermo-Nullifier`_ can be controlled via a `Thermo Sensor`_ 
      for finer control than is possible by regulating incoming fuel.
   -  A `Liquid Reservoir`_ output can be automated.

Automatic Duplicant Regolith clearing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/b/bd/Crown_moulding_digging.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 171px

      Regolith-covered Crown Moulding being excavated

   Placing build orders for `Crown Moulding`_ on the surface
   allows to order Duplicants to dig `Regolith`_ when the tile is
   covered, instead of re-ordering whenever new regolith is created.

   Since it is an invalid building location, the Crown Mouldings will never be
   built, but Duplicants will still dig anything that falls on those cells.

Natural tile heat sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Most natural tiles have far more mass than built Tile, and far more thermal mass
   than any other building which makes them very effective and readily available
   heat sinks in the early game. Furthermore, they lose half their mass, and
   therefore half of their stored heat, when mined. This can be leveraged to keep
   your base cool in the early game and buy more time until you need to build an
   active cooling system.

   By building a heat-producing building such as a `Coal Generator`_ in a location 
   surrounded by natural tiles, you can effectively contain almost all of the heat 
   the building produces to the surrounding area, rather than primarily warming the 
   air around the building which will then heat up your entire base. When you later 
   mine out the natural tile after it has been heated significantly, almost half 
   the heat produced by that building is deleted.

   For the same reasons, natural tile is also very effective as a temporary
   insulator and heat sink to keep temperature-sensitive areas cool. Each Farm Tile
   in a Mealwood farm is made of 100kg of dirt, and might contain another 10kg of
   dirt on average during operation, for a total of 147 kDTU/C° heat capacity. By
   contrast, a 1200kg natural dirt tile has 1776 kDTU/C° heat capacity, and a 950kg
   natural sandstone tile has 760 kDTU/C° heat capacity. Leaving just one or two
   natural tiles per Farm Tile near a Mealwood farm can make it heat up several
   times more slowly than it would if all the surrounding natural tile were dug out
   immediately.

   Similarly, you may want to place a polluted water cistern/heat sink somewhere
   that it can have a wall of natural tile (ideally at least 2 cells thick or with
   an outer layer of constructed tile so it's easy to replace the natural tile
   without spilling), only digging out the natural tile after you have an active
   cooling system ready.

Kiln melting to refine Metal Ore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Since `Kilns`_ have no overheat temperature and can be built with
   `Metal Ore`_, operating them in vacuum will make them heat up
   with no limit, eventually reaching their material's melting point.

   When that point is reached, the Kiln will melt, and the resulting liquid metal
   will instantly freeze into a `Refined Metal`_ because of
   the hysteresis temperature loss.

   It will take a few cycles and a few tons of `Ceramic`_ or `Refined Carbon`_ 
   production to reach the melting point depending on the material SHC. Since 
   `Gold Amalgam`_ has the lowest SHC, it is the fastest to melt.

   This converts Metal Ore to Refined Metal 200kg at a time, at a 1:1 ratio.

Aquatuner melting to refine Metal Ore & produce Liquid Steel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Similar to Kilns, `Thermo Aquatuners`_ can be melted to refine `Metal Ore`_ by 
   operating them in vacuum: when running constantly, they will reach the material 
   melting point long before breaking from overheating.

   The process is much faster due to the massive amount of heat Aquatuners produce,
   but uses power and cools the input liquid, which can be counteracted with a
   `Liquid Tepidizer`_ or just used elsewhere.

   How much time and power is needed depends on the material SHC. Again, since 
   `Gold Amalgam`_ has the lowest SHC, it is the fastest to melt.

   This converts Metal Ore to Refined Metal 1200kg at a time, at a 1:1 ratio. It's
   also a very convenient way to produce `Liquid Steel`_ for
   very high temperature builds.

One element per cell rule applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The `One element per cell rule`_ has several applications that are considered 
   exploits by part of the playerbase, despite being an intended mechanic, like 
   Infinite Storage or Hydra.

   The one element per cell rule is a game performance (marketing) decision, not a
   original design (sci-fi) logical decision and as such this decision itself allows
   for exploits and may be mistaken with the original intent. Exploits may be
   intended for being fun by expanding the game possibilities, however they are not
   by definition originally intended, nor in sync with the game's original design
   dialectic, which is why they appear counter-intuitive and even disturbing to some
   players. The clearer argument is that the game allows e.g. for infinite storage
   the Cannister Filler / Cannister Emptier system, while the Infinite Storage
   exploit is an application of the one element per cell rule, which both makes use
   of the one element per cell rule, and of the fact there are no pressure
   calculations against the walls the storage, stepping away from the sci-fi feel
   (original design) of the game. In the same way, the Hydra exploit makes use one
   element per cell rule to bypass the electrolizer's over-pressure mechanism, which
   is an even clearer exploit, contradicting the design of existing game elements

Arbor Tree auto-harvesting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Original thread`_

   `Arbor Trees`_ branches cannot grow in liquids and will break
   after being submerged for too long.

   This can be used by making a Waterfall fall on branches once they are fully
   matured to harvest branches without Duplicant interaction.

   When doing so, `Lumber`_ will fall on the floor, ready to be
   swept by an `Auto-Sweeper`_ for a fully automated farm.

Boosted Arbor Acorns production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Original thread`_

   `Arbor Acorns`_ have a chance to be spawned when a new
   branch starts growing and there is a `Pip`_ in the same room.

   By submerging branches in liquid, either with waterfalls or liquid stacking,
   branches will automatically be destroyed a short time after starting growing,
   cycling through branches at a fast rate.

   As a consequence, there will be a much faster `Arbor Acorn`_
   production, but this won't produce any `Lumber`_ because branches
   are destroyed before being fully matured.

Beads upward teleportation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/9/9e/Condensation_Teleportation.gif
      :width: 180px
      :height: 255px

      A gas condensing in `Airflow Tile`_ being teleported upwards.

   `Pumping setup`_ • `Setup using condensation teleportation`_

   When a bead is trapped in a tile it shouldn't be in and it cannot be moved to any
   adjacent cell, it will be teleported upwards, in the first valid cell found.

   This can be used in two ways:

   -  By making liquids form a bead when falling and closing a `Mechanized Airlock`_ 
      over that bead, it will be teleported upwards. Since airlocks closing timing is 
      not exact, it's advised to have a way out for liquids that isn't trapped in time: 
      having airlocks close on liquids that have no way to move can destroy them instantly.

   -  By making a `Gas`_ condense in an `Airflow Tile`_, the resulting liquid forms as 
      a bead and is forced to teleport upwards.

   It's useful to teleport liquids in Infinite Storage without using a `Liquid Pump`_, 
   saving on power as well as being much faster. When using the condensation variant, 
   this also means you can insulate the gas from the resulting liquid, only cooling 
   the gas just enough to condense it while not cooling the resulting liquid.

   *This does not work when melting debris, as debris melting form droplets, not
   beads. The liquid will only attempt to form in directly adjacent cells (excluding
   diagonal cells) before being deleted.*

Liquid/gas diagonal swapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/8/8d/Liquid_gas_bypass.png

      A Liquid-gas bypass design.

   `Original thread`_

   Under some circumstances detailed in the original thread, a liquid and a gas can
   exchange places diagonally, with the gas going upward and the liquid downward.

   This teleportation happens through a drip Liquid Airlock and as such can be used
   in various ways, such as high pressure gas storage, making vacuums, deleting some
   liquid or gas without Space Exposure.

Pumping superhot liquids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/4/47/Pump_ranges_annotated.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 121px

      Pump ranges. Red=pumping; Blue=detection

   `Original thread`_ • `Setup example`_

   `Liquid Pump`_ and `Mini Liquid Pump`_ have different pumping range and liquid
   detection range, based on its foundation tile F. Two cells P1 and P2 that are in
   pumping range are not in direct contact with the Liquid Pump, and more on the
   Mini Liquid Pump depending on its orientation. This can be used to pump very hot
   liquids like `Magma`_ that would otherwise overheat or melt pumps
   without any thermal exchange. Since those two cells are not in the detection
   range, Pumps must be tricked into pumping by providing a liquid in its detection
   range. Since F is in direct contact of P1 and P2, it cannot be used, and the cell
   above cannot either because the liquid cannot be blocked above. This means T1 or
   T2 needs to be used to trick Pumps.

   To trick the pump:

   -  A droplet can be dropped on T2, which will be pumped by a Liquid Pump and
      re-ejected at the same place. This halves the hot liquid output to 5kg/s. Show
      in example (2)

      .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/2/2c/Magma_pumps_annotated_2.png
         :width: 180px
         :height: 171px

         3 examples of Magma Pumps

   -  With 3 of the 4 orientations of a Mini Liquid Pump, a tile can be placed on T2
      and a droplet left on T1, which will not be pumped, keeping the full 1kg/s hot
      liquid output. Shown in example (3)

   -  A Waterfall can be dropped on T1, and broken just before it reaches T2 (by
      having an empty cell right of T1), allowing to get the full 10kg/s output out
      of a Liquid Pump. Shown in example (1)

   To pump the hot liquid:

   -  It can be pumped from P1 by ensuring the liquid doesn't get above that level.
      Shown in example (2) and (3)

   -  A Liquid Blade can be used to have a liquid reach P2 but never exceed it,
      especially with a high viscosity liquid like `Magma`_. Shown in
      example (1), which also allows dripping some of that into P1 for added safety.

   -  A Waterfall can be dropped on P2.

   *Note that example (3) isn't cooled: the Mini Liquid Pump will eventually
   overheat from its own heat creation and will need to be repaired or replaced,
   dropping Plastic in the hot liquid pool and creating Sour Gas. The other 2
   examples can be cooled by the liquid used to trick the pump as depicted by*
   `Wheezeworts`_ *on the examples.*

Rover workforce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   After achieving space flight and the necessary technology, you can drop rovers on
   your home colony, increasing the workforce. Rovers are most useful for working in
   inhospitable areas. The technique is lossless because rovers and rover modules
   can be deconstructed, and the rocket exhaust recycled.

Starving farming (ranching)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Certain critters can lay an egg before starving when Tame, such as `Pacu`_ and 
   `Shine Bugs`_. As long as these critters are not overcrowded, they can provide 
   infinite food.

Quick Sink use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/5/50/Instant_Sink_use.png

   `Bug report`_ • `Original video`_

   The `Sink`_ performs the germ removal part of its action even if
   the action bar doesn't complete because of an interruption.

   By removing a Sink's foundation when a Dupe is using it, the Dupe will be cleared
   of germs in a fraction of the time. The amount of time required varies depending
   on the number of germs on the Dupe.

Refrigerator as a cooling device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/4/4b/Fridge_exploit_minimal_with_filters.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 89px

      Minimal setup to turn a Refrigerator into a cooling device.

   `Bug report`_ • `Exploit example`_ • `Original video (russian)`_

   A `Refrigerator`_ can be used as a cooling device because it outputs much less 
   heat than it removes from its contents, and those contents are not insulated 
   when the refrigerator is unpowered.

   This can be automated with a `Timer Sensor`_ and a `Power Shutoff`_. The Timer 
   Sensor optimal values depend on the atmosphere temperature, but does not need 
   to be pulsed very fast. 2s green / 2s red works reasonably well.

   To maximize the cooling potential, use as many different items as possible. These
   items are the most convenient: `Muckroot`_, `Nutrient Bar`_, `Allergy Medication`_,
   `Curative Tablet`_, `Immuno Booster`_, `Vitamin Chews`_. More items means more 
   cooling, but are either more difficult to produce (`Berry Sludge`_, `Serum Vial`_) 
   or can spoil and need to be replaced.

   The cooling is more effective at higher temperatures, so `Ceramic`_ is recommended 
   to raise the overheat temperature to 275°C.

   This can be exploited to cool a `Steam Turbine`_ or
   condense the Steam from a `Cool Steam Vent`_.

Bug-Driven Exploits
-------------------

   Some mechanics derive from a bug or similar in systems: they are generally
   unstable, may break games, and are liable to be fixed in future updates.

   When the underlying bugs are fixed, they will be moved to the `Obsolete Exploits`_ page.

Instant bottle/canister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/5/56/Bottle-empty-instant.gif
      :width: 180px
      :height: 135px

      Left: the full duration of the emptying errand. 
      Right: the emptying errand is canceled as soon as it's started, completing it instantly.

   When emptying a bottle or canister, a Dupe is locked into an errand of a few
   seconds. If you cancel the emptying errand during that invisible animation,
   instead of dropping on the floor, the bottle or canister is instantly emptied.

   This allows saving a few seconds for each emptying errand.

Natural Tile from Airlocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/d/d4/Natural_tile_wiki.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 73px

   When deconstructed while the bottom cell is surrounded by tiles (for a total of 7
   tiles as shown in the example), a `Manual Airlock`_ or `Mechanized Airlock`_ will 
   produce a natural tile rather than debris. Those tiles can be used for `Pip`_ planting.

   #. Build the Airlock surrounded by tiles.
   #. Deconstruct it.
   #. There is a natural tile with the Airlock where its bottom cell was.

Diagonal access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Duplicants can construct everything except buildings through diagonal access. It
   has been confirmed as an intended mechanism by `Game Update 463874`_ in `Spaced Out DLC`_.

   This allows deleting gas/liquid by trapping them with four tiles, constructing a
   fifth one in the center then deconstructing it, easily creating a vacuum.

   `Auto-sweepers`_ can access items diagonally, which can be
   used to have them access items that are in a different room.

   Duplicants can enter rooms under a locked door built at a diagonal, while the
   room retains liquid/gas contents, performing a climb animation

Plastic to Metal conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Some items are built from several materials, but when melted only converts to
   their main material for the sum of all their materials mass.

   The most interesting example is the `Liquid Pipe Germ Sensor`_, which is made 
   out of 25kg of `Refined Metal`_ and 50kg of `Plastic`_. When melted, it will 
   produce 75kg of `Refined Metal`_.

   This can be used to convert Plastic into Refined Metal using Magma to melt arrays
   of sensors, making Refined Metal renewable even without a Metal Volcano.

Buildings in tiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/c/cc/Tile_over_building_annotated.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 186px

      Example of exploits using building in tiles

   `Bug report`_ • `Original video`_

   By replacing a `Tile`_ with a tile of the same type but a different
   material just before it's deconstructed, you can build another building inside.
   Once built, the tile and the building will co-exist in the same cell, leading to
   some unusual behavior that can be exploited to build a few contraptions:

   #. A `Manual Airlock`_ or `Mechanized Airlock`_ set to "Open" inside tiles will create a
      perfect airlock that doesn't leak gases. A save and reload is needed after
      opening the door
   #. `Wall Pots`_ can be embedded in tiles to work correctly
      without the need for a floor compared to a `Flower Pot`_.
      This is especially useful when combined with the Pip planting in Flower pots
      exploit.
   #. It can be used to put a liquid over the trick cell of a `Liquid Pump`_ to `pump superhot
      liquids`_

   The same technique cannot be used with `Gas Pumps`_, as putting
   an insulated tile over its cell of interest (bottom left one) prevents heat
   transfer and allows it to start the pumping animation, but prevents it from
   actually pumping any gas.

Liquid germ deletion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/c/c7/Liquid_scrubber.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 132px

      Liquid Scrubber

   `Bug report`_ • `Exploit example`_

   By creating beads out of germy liquid (using a `Liquid Vent`_ with a `Mesh Tile`_ 
   just below it), a significant amount of germs will be deleted from it. Germy liquid 
   can quickly be sanitized by repeating this process.

   For practical purposes, there is little advantage to this exploit compared to the
   intended method of letting liquids sit in `Reservoirs`_ in a `Chlorine`_ environment.

Dupes recovering breath without consuming Oxygen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/3/3d/Dupe_gasping.png

      A duplicant recovering breath without consuming any Oxygen


   `Bug report`_

   By making a Duplicant wear an `Oxygen Mask`_ or `Atmo Suit`_ without refilling its 
   `Oxygen`_, they will stop to recover their breath but not actually consume any Oxygen.

   This can be exploited to remove the need to provide Oxygen to Duplicants at the
   cost of frequent gasping interruptions.

Buildings internal storage heat manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/e/e5/SieveOutputTempExploit2.gif
      :width: 180px
      :height: 66px

      Water temperature manipulation exploited on the Water Sieve.

   `Bug report`_ • `Original thread`_

   A building's internal storage temperature sometimes uses the wrong value for
   output elements, using the element's previous temperature rather than current
   temperature of the element being converted.

   For example, this can be exploited on the `Water Sieve`_ by feeding it a small 
   amount of cold `Water`_, then switching to hot `Polluted Water`_. The output 
   water for the converted polluted water will sometime have the previous cold 
   water temperature, deleting large amounts of heat.

   Other buildings known for exhibiting this issue are the
   `Desalinator`_ and `Oil Refinery`_.

Thermo Aquatuner/Regulator pulsing power-saving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/8/85/Liquid_gas_synchronized_timer.png

      Liquid/gas based timer sensor

   `Thermo Aquatuner`_ and `Thermo Regulator`_ only need to be enabled and consume 
   power when a liquid/gas packet pass through them to enable their cooling effect.

   By designing a special timer sensor that's based on liquid/gas flow rather than
   actual time (since liquid and gas flow change when building pipes), it's possible
   to enable both buildings only when a packet pass through, to save on power. Using
   this, it's possible to use only a third of their normal power, about 400W for the
   Aquatuner (versus 1200W in normal operation) and about 80W for the Regulator
   (versus 240W in normal operation).

   This special timer sensor is designed to work against a single liquid/gas packet
   being looped in a pipe with 3 pipe sections linking input and output of that
   pipe, with an Element or Temperature Sensor to detect when the packet is passing
   through, and only activate the Thermo Aquatuner/Regulator for a short time based
   on that.

   Since this exploit is dependent on precise timing, it might not work fully as
   expected depending on game performance.

Power supply pulsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A simpler variant that saves more power but reduces the throughput is to pulse
   the power supply (rather than the building itself) of a `Thermo Aquatuner`_ or 
   certain other buildings using a `Power Shutoff`_ and a `Timer Sensor`_ set
   to 0.2s/0.2s.

   Using that method, you can expect to see a 95-100% reduced power consumption,
   while still achieving 50% throughput.

   An Aquatuner on a 0.2s/0.2s pulsed power supply will rarely consume power, around
   5% of the time. It is unclear why this happens, as it can go for long series of
   ticks without consuming any power at all.

   Most buildings can be power-pulsed in this manner to eliminate nearly all their
   power consumption, however their throughput will always be reduced. Most buildings 
   that don't require Duplicant operation will maintain 50% throughput: a non-exhaustive 
   list includes `Thermo Aquatuner`_, `Thermo Regulator`_, `Liquid Tepidizer`_, 
   `Electrolyzer`_, `Oxylite Refinery`_, Filters and Lights (if you don't mind epilepsy).

   The main exceptions are Pumps, `Water Sieve`_ and `Desalinator`_, which lose 
   dramatically more throughput or even produce nothing, possibly due to long 
   "wind up" animations or complicated multi-tick sequences: these buildings still 
   consume nearly no power, they just perform little to no useful work, possibly 
   to the extent of making them less power efficient when 0.2s/0.2s power-pulsed.

   This exploit can come with downsides like intense rapid hammering sounds and
   blinking.

Left-to-right liquid/gas flow heat transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/b/b9/Left_to_right_exploit_annotated.png

      An example of left-to-right staircase exploit applied to a 
      Petroleum Boiler, compared to a right-to-left staircase 
      that behaves normally.

   `Bug report`_

   `Liquids`_ and `Gases`_ flowing from left to right don't properly calculate heat.

   This can be exploited with liquids with a staircase going from left to right- any
   heat difference gets amplified. This is less easy to exploit for gases.

   This can be exploited for both cooling or heating:

   -  For heating, input cold liquid at the top, and counter-flow something hot.
   -  For cooling, input hot liquid at the top, and counter-flow something cold.

   It can be exploited in a late-game Petroleum Boiler using `Thermium`_: by making 
   `Crude Oil`_ flow in a staircase counterflow heat exchanger, Crude Oil heating 
   is amplified, which allows massive savings in heat required to boil the Crude into
   `Petroleum`_.

   Due to the nature of the bug, the effect drops off exponentially as the
   staircase gets longer.

   A high difference in temperature at each step is the key to exploit this bug
   efficiently.

Lavatory use without emptying Dupe bladder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/0/04/LavatoryExploit.gif

      An example of a Lavatory exploit, producing 2kg/s of Polluted Water.

   `Bug report`_ • `Exploit example`_ • `Original video (chinese)`_

   When interrupting a Duplicant going to a `Lavatory`_, the Lavatory will be used, 
   outputting more water than it uses, but the Duplicant bladder won't be emptied.

   This can be exploited to spawn large amounts of `Polluted Water`_ by repeatedly 
   interrupting a Duplicant going to relieve itself.

Tepidizer target temperature bypass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/6/66/Tepidizer_minimal_exploit.png

      An example of a minimal power-positive exploit using the 
      target temperature zone check.

   `Bug report`_ • `Exploit example`_

   There are two ways to trick a `Liquid Tepidizer`_ into
   working above its target temperature:

   -  Rapidly pulse it on and off with a `Timer Sensor`_ or looped `NOT_Gate`_.
   -  Add a 400kg+ cell of liquid inside its target temperature zone check.

   By using either method, you can get a Liquid Tepidizer to heat up liquid to very
   high temperatures before a game reload.

   After a game reload, there is a soft limit of 125°C after which the Tepidizer
   will only heat at 64kDTU/s. The full 4064kDTU/s under 125°C can still be used
   to boil `Water`_ and extract a very small amount of power using
   a `Steam Turbine.`_

Liquid to debris heating and cooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/6/6b/Debris_freezer.png

      An example of a cooling exploit, initialized with a very cold Ice Debris

   `Bug report`_
   • `Power generation exploit example`_
   • `Cooling exploit example`_
   • `Abyssalite melter exploit example`_

   When a liquid solidifies on existing debris, the resulting debris is merged into
   it, but only the existing debris temperature is kept.

   This bug can be exploited for both heating and cooling.

Liquid duplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/4/49/Liquid_duplication_design.png

      Materials view of a liquid duplication design.

   `Bug report`_ • `Exploit example`_

   By dropping beads of a liquid on the same liquid with a small quantity of another
   liquid above blocking it, you can duplicate it.

   Using the exploit example, this can result in 2kg/s of liquid created for a power
   cost of 240W.

Enclosed Telescope Oxygen rationing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Enclosed Telescope requires a supply of oxygen in order to be used by a
   Duplicant. However, once they are inside the Enclosed Telescope, no oxygen is
   required, and the Duplicant's breath will not deplete even if it runs out. This
   exploit is most useful inside rockets, where oxygen supply may be more limited.
   An easy way to do this is to use a Gas Valve set to the smallest value to trickle
   oxygen into the Enclosed Telescope, keeping it active without consuming much
   oxygen.

Infinite copper ore farming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Building then deconstructing a `Solo Spacefarer Nosecone`_ drops an extra 100 kg 
   of copper ore from the free Rocket control station inside. This can be repeated 
   as a free source.

Skipping repair costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Repairing damaged wires costs 2.5 kg of metal. Replacing the damaged wire with
   one of a different metal type skips the 2,5Kg metal cost. Of course
   deconstructing and reconstructing would work too but requires two actions instead
   and interrupts the power flowing. Should work with buildings also by
   deconstructing / reconstructing, and is useful on low metal starts

Saving metal on wiring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Wires and wire bridges use the same amount of metal, but bridges are longer. 4
   tiles cost 100 kg metal with just wire, and 75 kg with a bridge and 2 wires.
   Repeating the latter saves 25 kg metal every 4 tiles.

Freshener Spice returns food to 100%
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Example`_

   If food spiced with `Spice Grinder`_ manages positive
   decay, it can go back up to 100% freshness. For example, spiced food under -18 °C
   and in a sterile atmosphere will gain 0.9% freshness per cycle.

Disabled building room requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   `Example`_

   Disabled, floating or otherwise non-functional buildings still count towards room
   requirements. This is useful to save on resources or floor space.

Dupliants 复制人
===============

   This article is considered `accurate`_ for the current version (`U51-600112`_).

      :height: 143px

   A **Duplicant** is one of the tiny, frustrating, but also endearing clones that 
   the player manages in `Oxygen Not Included`_. Each are printed with unique traits 
   and have needs that must be fulfilled so they can survive. New games begin with a 
   selection dialog where the player has to select three randomly generated Duplicants.

   As the game progresses, a player may get more of them from the `Printing Pod`_. 
   You can also get a Duplicant from a `Cryotank 3000`_ in the `Spaced Out!`_ DLC.

Duplicant Selection
-------------------

      :width: 200px
      :height: 143px

New Game Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   At the start of the game, as the last step of the `Game Settings`_, three Duplicants 
   are to be selected as the starting team. The player may reroll any Duplicants any 
   number of times. Players can also select one interest for a Duplicant to guarantee 
   they will have the selected interest when rerolling. The Duplicant can be renamed 
   in this menu.

Printing Pod Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/e/e3/Printing_selection.png
      :class: thumbimage
      :width: 180px
      :height: 108px

      The Duplicant selection dialog as it appears during the game.

   After the Printing Pod's cooldown timer is finished after 3 `Cycles`_, it will become 
   ready, giving the opportunity to either receive a new Duplicant or a `Care Package`_.
   Unlike the start of the game, the Duplicants cannot be rerolled `↑[1]`. If no Duplicants 
   are deemed suitable for the colony, you can reject all options. Exiting the dialogue 
   will not reject the printing options and can be re-entered at a later time. The cooldown 
   of the printing pod will not start until a Duplicant has been selected or rejected.

   #. `↑[1]` This can be bypassed by saving and reloading the game, which will regenerate all options.

Starting Bonuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/8/88/Example_duplicate_bonuses.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 383px

   When a Duplicant is rolled, one to three random interests will be chosen. Each interest 
   provides a starting bonus to the related attribute. The amount depends on the number 
   of interests that were chosen. One interest will result in a +7 bonus, two interests 
   a +3 bonus, and three interests a +1 bonus to each attribute.

   Extra points based on the Duplicant's traits may be applied. These can be found in the 
   `Traits`_ section under the "Interest Attribute Modifier" column. If a Duplicant has 
   more than one interest, the extra points are randomly divided across each of them.

   In this example, the Duplicant has three interests which gives +1 to their associated 
   attributes. The Unempathetic trait grants a +2 Interest Attribute Modifier. One of 
   those is added to the `Construction`_ attribute and the other is added to the 
   `Digging`_ attribute.

   Note that Supplying and Tidying have the same corresponding attribute `Strength`_. 
   The bonus to Strength does stack, but the UI incorrectly displays the total bonus 
   for both interests. If a Duplicant is rolled with both Supplying and Tidying, they 
   will receive a +3 bonus to Strength for Tidying and +3 bonus to Strength for Supplying. 
   This means the Duplicant will start with a Strength of 6. However, the UI will display 
   "+6 Strength" next to both interests implying the Duplicant will get a +12 bonus 
   which is not the case.

Duplicant Properties
--------------------

   Properties are aspects of Duplicants that aren't leveled and can't be intrinsically 
   changed (as opposed to `Skills`_). However, many Properties have positive and 
   negative Traits associated with them.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

   Each Duplicant has 11 different attributes. These attributes define how effectively Duplicants 
   will perform those errands. Upon creation, Duplicant attributes are determined by their 
   interests and certain traits. A negative Trait may lower a Duplicant attribute or prevent 
   them from performing a specific errand.

   All attributes can be trained by running related `errands`_. This can increase an attribute 
   by a maximum of 20 and is added on top of other modifiers.

Interests
~~~~~~~~~

   Each Duplicant can have between 1 and 3 interests. Interests give bonuses to their 
   related attributes, give a +1 Morale bonus for related Skills, and raise experience 
   gain from associated activities, enabling skill points to be earned faster.

   +--------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+

   | `Supplying`_ | `Tidying`_   | `Rocketry`_    |                |                 |
   +--------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+

Traits
~~~~~~

   Inborn traits (traits duplicants start with) give bonuses or penalties to duplicants 
   attributes. Negative traits may also make it impossible for a duplicant to perform 
   certain `Skills`_. Traits gained through certain skills mainly allow for the duplicant
   to use certain `stations`_ and perform certain `errands`_.

   Note that narcoleptic sleep can be interrupted by giving the Duplicant a movement command.

   Also note that changes to skill distribution via traits has no effect on the maximum 
   attribute level learnable, which is +20 not counting attribute or job modifiers.

Morale
~~~~~~

   `Morale`_ has an impact on how much `Stress`_ is incurred or reduced and is affected 
   by several factors. Generally, there are very few Morale Penalties.

   Required Morale depends on the amount of training a Duplicant has had. The more skills 
   they have been trained in, the greater the Morale they require to stave off stress. 
   Advanced skills increase the Morale requirement more than basic skills do.

   Duplicants have a perception of `Decor`_ and `Food`_. The higher the average Decor 
   during the last cycle and the higher the `Food Quality`_, the higher the Morale Boost 
   will be. Morale penalties will be incurred if below the individual's perception.

   Without a modifier, the Morale from Food ranges from -1 to +16 or is modified 0 to +16 
   with the Simple Tastes trait and -1 to +12 with Foodie. Duplicants will start eating 
   in their downtime when below 3.300 kcal and has the highest priority.

   Normal Decor Perception is at 0, exceeding it can yield up to +12 Morale when reaching 
   120 difference and failing to will decrease Morale by -1. The Morale Boost is not linear.

   Using `rooms`_, having downtime and interacting with certain buildings will confer 
   a Morale Boost. If there is a `Recreation Room`_ available with Oxygen on its floor, 
   duplicants will use certain furniture only if they do not yet have the Morale Boost 
   and they do so in the order of the most possible Morale gained.

   Depending on duplicant's `Interests`_, the highest Morale achievable is 94-105. 
   The lowest is -1.

Sress Responses
''''''''''''''''

   Each Duplicant has a different stress response. These responses trigger at 100% stress 
   (stress is reduced after the 100% response). All responses stop the current errand in 
   order to perform the response. These responses cannot be stopped by `Red Alert`_ or 
   commanding the Duplicant to move.

Overjoyed Responses
'''''''''''''''''''

   Overjoyed responses are positive effects that can occur when the morale of a duplicant 
   is higher than necessary for their morale requirements. Morale is checked when a 
   duplicant finishes sleeping. If morale exceeds expectation by over 8 points, there 
   is a 2% chance the Duplicant will awaken with an overjoyed response. This probability 
   rises linearly with morale up to a maximum of 5% chance with 20 excess morale.

Ownership
---------

   Individual duplicants can have ownership of certain structures: `Cots`_, `Comfy Bed`_, 
   `Mess Tables`_, `Massage Tables`_, `Med Beds`_, `Lavatory`_ and `Pharma Chambers`_. 
   Each Duplicant can only be assigned to one, and they can be reassigned by the player 
   at any time. They will automatically select them for themselves if left unassigned, 
   or the duplicant becomes sick.

Emotions
--------

   Duplicants occasionally express emotions or reactions to things around them. This 
   indicates their status in ways that the player can keep track of.

Established Duplicants
----------------------

   Duplicants have an assigned name, appearance, stress response and description 
   (attributes, traits, and interests are still randomly generated). Changing the 
   name of a Duplicant will alter the description as appropriate but will not change 
   the appearance of the Dupe.

   Most duplicants can appear when creating a new game, with the exception of:

   -  Ari, Mae, Ada, Meep, Liam, and Banhi can only be spawned from the Printing Pod after the start.
   -  Jorge can only be obtained by completing the `Mysterious Hermit`_ `story trait`_.

Radition 辐射
============

   https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation

   .. Note::

      核辐射是原子核从一种结构或一种能量状态转变为另一种结构或另一种能量状态过程中所释放出来的微观粒子流。
      核辐射主要是 α、β、γ 三种射线：

      *  α 射线是氦核（两个中子、两个质子），外照射穿透能力很弱，只要用一张纸就能挡住，但吸入体内危害大；
      *  β 射线是电子流，照射皮肤后烧伤明显。这两种射线由于穿透力小，影响距离比较近只要辐射源不进入体内，影响不会太大；
      *  γ 射线的穿透力很强，是一种波长很短的电磁波。γ辐射和X射线相似，能穿透人体和建筑物，危害较小。

      现代物理学从宏观到微观的物质构成模型有：分子（Molecule）、原子（Atom）、中子（Neutron）、
      质子（Proton）、夸克（quark）、弦（Strings）。弦理论的物理模型认为组成所有物质的最基本单位是
      一小段“能量弦线”，大至星际银河，小至电子、质子、夸克一类的基本粒子都是由这占有二维时空的“能量线”
      所组成。微观粒子之间仅存在四种相互作用力：

      *  万有引力（universal gravitation）
      *  电磁力（electromagnetic force）
      *  强相互作用力（strong interaction）
      *  弱相互作用力（weak interaction）

      弦论是最有希望将自然界的基本粒子和四种相互作用力统一起来的理论。在夸克理论提出后，人们认识到基本粒
      子也有复杂的结构。欧洲核子研究组织（Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire）
      建设于瑞士日内瓦的大型强子对撞机（Large Hadron Collider）通过加速到接近光速电子撞击质子后，
      发现了更小的夸克。夸克模型（Quark Model）中包含强子（强作用力），强子中最稳定的是质子和中子，
      它们是构成原子核的单元，它们都由三个夸克构成。夸克理论认为，夸克都是被囚禁在粒子内部的，不存在
      单独的夸克。
      
      1990 年建成的北京正负电子对撞机（Electron Positron Collider）参与粲夸克和 τ 轻子物理研究，
      并取得一定成果。1992 年，BEPC 给出了 τ 轻子质量的精准测量，精度比原来提高了 10 倍，更新了粒子
      物理学数据权威《粒子物理手册》（PDG），被认为是当年国际最好的粒子物理成果。

      粒子物理学建立的标准模型（Standard Model）是描述了强力、弱力及电磁力这三种基本力及组成所有物质的
      基本粒子的理论。粒子物理标准模型框架下，物质世界的基本粒子有夸克、轻子等 61 种基本粒子。粲夸克属于
      基本粒子标准模型中六类夸克之一（上夸克、下夸克、奇夸克、粲夸克、顶夸克、底夸克）。

      大统一理论（grand unified theories，GUTs），又称万物之理，理论上宇宙间所有现象都可以用这四种
      作用力来解释。通过进一步研究四种作用力之间联系与统一，寻找能统一说明四种相互作用力的理论或模型称为
      大统一理论。最晚发现也是最易被忽视的就是弱力，弱力并不是最弱的力，它至少比引力强。

      物理学家马克斯·普朗克于 1900 年发现，能量可以分为不可再分割的单位，并将其命名为“量子”。
      量子（quantum）是现代物理的重要概念，即一个物理量如果存在最小的不可分割的基本单位，则这个物理量
      是量子化的，这个最小单位称为量子。量子力学（Quantum Mechanics）是研究物质世界微观粒子运动规律
      的物理学分支，主要研究原子、分子、凝聚态物质，以及原子核和基本粒子的结构、性质的基础理论。

      现代物理学流行的名词是“量子化”，能量、动量、角动量等物理量都是量子化的。量子场论一次量子化还不够，
      再来个二次量子化。几十年来，物理学家提出各种版本的“万物之理”（统一场论）：弦论、圈论、旋子论、扭子论、
      时空非互易论等，绝大多数基于时空量子化，认为时间和空间都具有最小单元——普朗克时间（:math:`5.39 \times 10^-44` 秒）
      和普朗克长度（:math:`1.6 \times 10^-35` 米）。

      The Symbol for Radiation Buildings and the Radiation Overlay.


   **Radiation** is a game mechanic introduced in the `Spaced Out DLC`_. Certain 
   elements and buildings such as `Uranium Ore`_ and the `Research Reactor`_ generate 
   ambient radiation. Its strength is measured in Rads per cycle, which `Duplicants`_ 
   and `Plants`_ absorb in form of `Rads`_. Duplicants will release some amount of 
   rads when using the toilet. Duplicants can also be protected from radioactivity 
   by using `Lead Suits`_. If exposed to too much radiation, Duplicants will become 
   sick with `Radiation Sickness`_.

   Radiation usually refers to the Ambient Radiation that's measured in Rads per cycle.

Hazard Rating
-------------

   ==================  ========================================
   Hazard Rating       Radiation Strength
   Completely Safe     Exactly 0 rads per cycle
   Mostly Safe         Between more than 0 to 100 rad per cycle
   Barely Safe         Between 100 and 200 rads per cycle
   Slight Hazard       Between 200 and 400 rads per cycle
   Significant Hazard  Between 400 and 2000 rads per cycle
   Extreme Hazard      Between 2000 and 4000 rads per cycle
   Maximum Hazard      Above 4000 rads per cycle
   ==================  ========================================


Radiation Protection
--------------------

   Different Materials shield from Radiation, see the Page on `Radiation Absorption`_ 
   for a comprehensive list.

   Duplicants absorb Radiation according to the tile their feet occupy, and `Lead Suits`_ 
   protect them from 66% of it, so they only absorb 34% (not a full third, but 34% exactly).

   Having eaten Seafood (raw `Pacu Fillet`_, `Cooked Seafood`_, or `Surf'n'Turf`_) grants 
   **Radiation Resistance: Seafood** which decreases Radiation Absorption by 20% for 2 Cycles.

   These stack cumulative to only absorb 14% if a Duplicant both has eaten Seafood, and wears 
   a Lead Suit.

   The `Basic Rad Pill`_ grants Radiation Rejuvination of -100 Rads per Cycle for one cycle.

   Duplicants with the rad eater trait can transform up to 150 rads absorbed into calories.

   Using the bathroom (whether `Latrine`_, `Outhouse`_, or `Wall Toilet`_) reduces the absorbed 
   Rad Dose by 100. A duplicant will go to the bathroom when they have either a bathroom or 
   downtime break **and** their bladder is at 40% or higher, allowing for ~200 rads removed 
   per cycle when an additional bathroom break is added half-way through a schedule.

   A Duplicant that has absorbed too much Radiation may develop `Radiation Sickness`_.


Radiation Blocking
------------------

   Most things block radiation, including gases. Their ratings are shown in their documentation, 
   but the in-game blocking rating may be different. **The only things that do not block radiation 
   in any way are** `Airflow Tiles`_ **,** `Mesh Tiles`_ **and** `Solar Panels`_ **.**

Rockets 火箭发展超简史
======================

   19 世纪中叶，第二次工业革命开启人类社会进步的快进模式，1876 年内燃机正式登上了历史的舞台。
   人类开始了大规模的烧开水时代，通过高压蒸汽为机械提供驱动力。

   1883 年德国人 G.戴姆勒 成功制造汽油机。汽油机用于小至 1kw 以下的农业、园艺机具的动力，
   大到数千瓦的航空发动机。汽油发动机（Gasoline Engine ）以汽油作为燃料，将内能转化成动能。
   由于汽油粘性小，蒸发快，可以用汽油喷射系统将汽油喷入气缸，经过压缩达到一定的温度和压力后，
   用火花塞点燃，使气体膨胀做功。汽油机的特点是转速高、结构简单、质量轻、造价低廉、运转平稳、
   使用维修方便。汽油机在汽车上，特别是小型汽车上大量使用。

   1886 年以汽油动力的奔驰 1 号发动机的功率只有 0.89 匹马力，最高速度为 16km/h。在那个时代，
   相比马车就好比现在续航不高的电动车，不被人看好也不是很流行。

   经过一百多年的发展，燃料从当初的煤气变成现在的汽油、柴油乃至天然气，转速也从 100rpm 到如今
   六七千乃至上万，功率也从当初的 4.4Ps 逐渐发展到几百上千马力。1 英制马力为 550 英尺·磅/秒，
   等于 745.7 瓦特。

   .. figure:: http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190221/44df0a9a3e0d4166b3148c882ce9e5f2.gif
      :target: https://www.sohu.com/a/295994070_372813

   最基础属于四冲程发动机，一个做功周期循环需要经历四个阶段。首先是吸气冲程。活塞沿着绿色箭头向下运动，
   此时气缸顶部左侧的进气阀门打开，混合气被抽入燃烧室。然后进气门关闭，活塞开始向上运动并压缩混合气。
   在压缩将近行程终点的时候火花塞点火，引燃混合气。高温高压的气体推动活塞向下运动。最后是排气冲程，
   顶部右侧的排气阀门打开，活塞向上运动并将废气排出。至此，一整个工作流程结束，接着开始下一轮吸气，
   压缩，做功，排气的循环。四个冲程最关键的就是气门机构的开闭控制气体有序地进出气缸、并完成做功过程。
   当汽车发动机在低速运转时，气流惯性小，若此时配气定时保持不变，则部分进气将被活塞推出气缸，使进气量
   减少，气缸内残余废气将会增多。当发动机在高速运转时，气流惯性大，若此时增大进气迟后角和气门重叠角，
   则能增加进气量和减少残余废气量，使发动机的换气过程臻于完善。因此，气门开闭的时间点对于各个转速区间
   来说都是不同的，可变气门正时系统应运而生。

   引擎的发展过程中先后出现了以下几种引擎技术：

   *  外燃机，燃料在发动机的外部燃烧，1816 年由苏格兰的 R.斯特林所发明，也称斯特林发动机。
      瓦特改良的蒸汽机就是一种典型的外燃机，当大量的煤燃烧产生热能把水加热成大量的水蒸汽时，
      高压便产生了，然后这种高压又推动机械做功。然后通过热能转装置给汽体降温，活塞复位，然后
      再进入新一轮的加热、降温过程，从而完成了热能向动能的转变。
   *  内燃机，即往复活塞式发动机，这一类型的发动机与外燃机的最大不同在于它的燃料在其内部燃烧。
      内燃机的种类十分繁多，常见的汽油机、柴油机是典型的内燃机。
   *  燃气轮机，燃烧产生高压燃气，并利用燃气的高压推动燃气轮机的叶片旋转，从而输出动力。
      由于很难精细地调节燃气轮机的输出功率，所以较少用于汽车和摩托车，只有部分赛车使用。
   *  喷气发动机，靠喷管高速喷出的气流直接产生反推力的发动机。燃料、氧化剂在燃烧室内起化学反应，
      释放的热能在喷管中转化为调整气流。燃料、氧化剂由飞行器携带的称为火箭发动机，包括固体燃料
      火箭发动机、液体燃料火箭发动机。

   航空发动机（aero-engine）起步于活塞式发动机，发展至今的绝对主流是燃气涡轮发动机。经过百余年的发展，
   燃气涡轮发动机成为为航空发动机中绝对的主流，主要包括涡轮喷气发动机、涡轮风扇发动机、涡轮螺旋桨发动机
   和涡轮轴发动机四种，它们的工作场景和总体架构有所差别，但工作原理相似，并且均由涡轮喷气发动机这一基本
   构型发展而来。

   第二次世界大战结束后，由于涡轮喷气发动机的发明而开创了喷气时代，活塞式发动机逐步退出主要航空领域，
   但功率小于 370kW 的水平对缸活塞式发动机仍广泛应用在轻型低速飞机和直升机上使用。现代涡轮喷气发动
   机的结构由进气道、压气机、燃烧室、涡轮和尾喷管组成，战斗机的涡轮和尾喷管间还有加力燃烧室。涡轮喷气
   发动机仍属于热机的一种，遵循热机的做功原则：输入的高压能量，变成低压下释放能量。因此，从产生输出
   能量的原理上讲，喷气式发动机和活塞式发动机是相同的，都需要有进气、加压、燃烧和排气这四个阶段，不同
   的是，在活塞式发动机中这 4 个阶段分时依次进行，喷气发动机中则是连续进行，气体依次流经喷气发动机的
   各个部分，就对应着活塞式发动机的四个工作位置。

   涡轮喷气发动机的缺点也突出，那就是在低速下耗油量大，效率较低，使飞机的航程变得很短。尽管这对于执行
   防空任务的高速战斗机还并不十分严重，但若用在对经济性有严格要求的亚音速民用运输机上却是不可接受的。
   发动机的效率实际上包括两个部分：热效率、推进效率。为提高热效率，一般来需要提高燃气在涡轮前的温度
   和压气机的增压比，但在飞机的飞行速度不变的情况下，提高涡轮前温度将会使喷气发动机的排气速度增加，
   导致在空气中损失的动能增加，这样又降低了推进效率。由于热效率和推进效率对发动机循环参数矛盾的要求，
   致使涡轮喷气发动机的总效率难以得到较大的提升。涡轮风扇发动机就可以解决同时提高喷气发动机的热效率、
   和推进效率，也就是既提高涡轮前温度又至少不增加排气速度。这种发动机在涡轮喷气发动机的的基础上增加了
   几级涡轮，并由这些涡轮带动一排或几排风扇，风扇后的气流分为两部分，一部分进入压气机（内涵道），另一
   部分则不经过燃烧，直接排到空气中（外涵道）。由于涡轮风扇发动机一部分的燃气能量被用来带动前端的风扇，
   因此降低了排气速度，提高了推进效率，而且，如果为提高热效率而提高涡轮前温度后，可以通过调整涡轮结构
   参数和增大风扇直径，使更多的燃气能量经风扇传递到外涵道，就不会增加排气速度。这样，对于涡轮风扇发动机
   来讲，热效率和推进效率不再矛盾，只要结构和材料允许，提高涡轮前温度总是有利的。

   目前航空用涡轮风扇发动机主要分两类，即不加力式涡轮风扇发动机和加力式涡轮风扇发动机。前者主要用于高
   亚音速运输机，后者主要用于歼击机，由于用途不同，这两类发动机的结构参数也大不相同。

   Carbon Dioxide Engine 原理是将超临界 CO₂ 作为工质，通过加热使其膨胀，驱动涡轮机旋转，
   再通过冷却使其压缩回原来的状态，形成一个循环。糖素引擎（Sugar Engine）和二氧化碳引擎同为
   相对低效的短程用途的发动机。
   
   黑火药是一种早期的炸药。一般由硫磺、木炭和硝石（硝酸鉀）混合而成，其中木炭作为燃料，而硫磺和硝石
   作为氧化剂。由于火药能大量产生气体和热量的燃烧特性，其被广泛地用作枪械中的发射药和煙火中的烟火药
   （pyrotechnic composition），且直到 17 世纪中叶前都是唯一的化学爆炸物。

   鸦片战争时中英两国都使用黑火药兵器，然而其品质却相差甚远。清朝的岸防大炮比英军舰炮更重，理应射程
   更远，但实战中却往往被英军火炮在远距离吊打，原因就在于火药质量的低劣。英国火药的品质远远优于中国
   土产火药。1825 年，化学家歇夫列里在经过多次实验后，发现了黑火药的化学反应方程式：

   .. math:: 2KNO_3 + 3C + S → K_2 S ↓ + N_2 ↑ + 3CO_2 ↑

   根据这一方程式，英国配制了硝、硫、炭的比率为 75%、10%、15% 的枪用发射火药，以及组配比率为
   78%、8%、14% 的炮用发射火药。英国以近代科学指导军械制造，并采用蒸汽机等机械生产，工艺精良，
   其火药的燃烧速度是中国火药所远不能及的。

   中国火药则源于炼丹道士的偶然发现，制造过程充满了玄学色彩，古人提及火药制造流程，往往称之为“舂造”，
   实际上的确是舂出来的，火药颗粒大小取决于工人手感，十分写意。鸦片战争中广东水师提督关天培采用的火药
   配方是硝 80%、硫 10%、炭 10%，硝含量过高，容易吸潮，不宜久藏。英国人缴获中国火药，往往直接销毁。

   虽然如今黑火药早已被淘汰，但仍然在民用方面有应用，如制造节日用的焰火和爆竹，采石、伐木和矿山的爆破等。
   黑火药中的木炭的多孔结构可以嵌入硝酸钾晶体，硫填充它们的缝隙，一定程度上充当粘合剂。三种物料分别研磨
   后再进行称量其比例会更准确，混合后加入适量蒸馏水（乙醇）再继续研磨，研磨至混合物呈湖状再用合适的模具
   压实成条状，晾干，切粒。

   白糖可以作为火药的原料，白糖是一种碳水化合物，其分子式为 :math:`C_12 H_22 O_11`。当白糖遇到
   高温或者催化剂时，就会发生分解反应，产生大量的二氧化碳和水蒸气，并释放出大量的热能。这种反应就是
   爆炸反应，其原理和火药类似。然而，硝糖有两个个很致命的问题，一个就是燃速太低，远远不能用来做炸药，
   做火箭推进剂还差不多；另一个是它易吸潮，如果不做密封防潮处理，往往在放上几天后硝糖火药就开始溶解，
   逐渐变成一滩糊糊。白糖和硝酸钾混合在一起就可以制成一种简易的爆炸物，也被称为“火箭糖”。这种爆炸物
   可以用于制作小型的火箭或者焰火。

   硝酸钾常搭配葡萄糖而不是白糖，从化学角度讲，葡萄糖（含水）熔点72，容易操作且安全。而白糖熔点 160，
   在熔化时发生碳化分解。在这温度下混硝酸钾很容易爆燃。由于葡萄糖含有醛基，还原性更强，故其燃烧速度也
   比白糖的快。经配平，产生同量气体，葡萄糖耗氧量更小，所以选葡萄糖更好。

   目前，涡扇喷气发动机潜能已经到顶，为了获得更高的速度，需要新型技术。脉冲爆震发动机就是通过爆炸式
   燃烧产生的巨大能量来实现超过 16 马赫的飞行速度，目前实验成功的模型有旋转爆震发动机（rotating detonation）。
   马赫数是速度与音速的比值，音速(即声音的传播速度)在不同高度、温度与大气密度等状态下具有不同数值，
   只是一个相对值，每“一马”的具体速度并不固定。奥地利物理学家恩斯特·马赫（Ernst Mach，1838-1916）
   首次引用这个单位，所以用他的名字命名这个相对速度单位。

Construction
------------

   Each rocket must have an engine at its base, a `Command Capsule`_ at the top, 
   and a `Gantry`_ providing access to the command capsule. Rockets may optionally 
   include other modules, such as `Cargo Bays`_ for carrying materials back from 
   expeditions or `Research Modules`_ for `Data Banks`_.

   Players can safely deconstruct and replace modules in a rocket, but modules can 
   only be built if connected vertically (possibly via other modules) to an engine.

   While there is no limit to the number of modules in a rocket, the range of a 
   rocket is dependent on its mass, so unnecessary modules are ill-advised.

   As rockets typically produce a large amount of heat during take-off, building 
   the rocket inside an insulated tower can help to prevent heat from leaching 
   into other parts of the base. Building the rocket in space alleviates this 
   problem, but meteors need to be considered.

Engines
~~~~~~~

   There are 3 engines in the game: `Steam Engine`_, `Petroleum Engine`_, and 
   `Hydrogen Engine`_. `Solid Fuel Thrusters`_ can be used in conjunction with 
   engines to provide extra range. Note that solid fuel thrusters require their 
   own gantry to provide access for supply errands.

   Steam Engines are the entry-level rocket engine that must be used to unlock the 
   others. Without Solid Fuel Thrusters they are limited to a 10,000 km range, 
   allowing access to only the closest destinations on the starmap. However, they 
   only require `Steam`_, do not require separate fuel storage tanks, and have 
   significantly cooler rocket exhausts.

   Petroleum Engines are used in intermediate-level space exploration. In addition 
   to the engine itself, they require `Liquid Fuel Tanks`_ and `Solid`_ or 
   `Liquid Oxidizer Tanks`_ to function. Although technically capable of reaching 
   any destination on the starmap, they can only reach 110,000 km destinations with 
   cargo bays and no solid fuel. Petroleum engines using exclusively solid oxidizers 
   (`Oxylite`_) are further limited to a 60000 km range with cargo. Nevertheless, 
   the fuel required is relatively easy to obtain, allowing players to collect rare 
   space materials in preparation for the Hydrogen Engine.

   Hydrogen Engines are the most advanced type of rocket engine, working similarly 
   to Petroleum Engines but offering better distance. They run off `Liquid Hydrogen`_, 
   which requires temperatures below -250 °C to create, possible through the use of 
   `Super Coolant`_ and `Thermo Aquatuners`_.

   All engines have an exhaust, which is divided into 2 parts:

   -  An element emitted at a specific temperature under the rocket and does not go 
      through tiles. All rockets engine emits at the same rate, which translates to 
      0.7 kg/cell per launch/landing on the constant speed part of the rocket, and 
      more directly at launch/landing since the rocket is slower.

   -  A heating factor which heats elements under the rocket up to 2926.9 °C, at a 
      rate depending on the engine type and go through tiles and has a 3x9 rectangular 
      pattern.

   Both are done during launch and landing of the rocket.

Cargo Bays
~~~~~~~~~~

   Cargo Bays are used to retrieve resources from destinations. There is no limit 
   to the number of `Solid`_, `Liquid`_, `Gas`_, or `Biological`_ cargo bay on a 
   rocket, but bear in mind these add considerable weight to a rocket, reducing 
   the distance it can travel. All cargo modules have the same weight of 2 t and 
   the same capacity of 1 t, with the exception of `Biological Cargo Bay`_ which 
   has a capacity of 10 items.

   The resources returned from a destination depends on the save file, but is the 
   same every time for each type of container and each specific planet on a given 
   save. Different destination types offer different typical resource distributions 
   (listed below).

   -  `Solid Cargo Bays`_ bring back one ton of solid material from a planet.
   -  `Liquid Cargo Bays`_ bring back one ton of liquid material.
   -  `Gas Cargo Bays`_ bring back one ton of gaseous material.
   -  `Biological Cargo Bays`_ bring back a small number of seeds or critters, 
      if the destination has them.

Utility Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Rockets may contain other modules for additional functions.

   -  `Research Modules`_ will unlock information about a destination, providing 
      50 data units in the process that can be used with a `Virtual Planetarium`_. 
      Future missions to a fully analysed destination will only yield 10.

   -  `Sight-Seeing Modules`_ will allow passengers to come along for the trip, 
      reducing stress.

Command Capsule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Every rocket ends with a `Command Capsule`_ at the top, which is where the 
   astronaut enters and a space suit is to be provided.

Rocket Launch
-------------

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/c/c7/Rocket_heat.png
      :width: 180px
      :height: 101px

      The area below the engine is heated up in a 3x9 rectangle. 
      The heat is directly added to the current Heat of whatever
      tile/gas/liquid is inside of the 3x9 rectangle.

   Prior to takeoff, the `Command Capsule`_ checks for several conditions:

   -  The rocket must have a fuel tank (note that `Steam Engines`_ have their fuel tanks built-in).
   -  A destination within the rocket's range must be selected in the `Starmap`_.
   -  A Duplicant with the Rocket Piloting skill must be assigned and manning the Command Capsule.
   -  The Command Capsule must have an `Atmo Suit`_.
   -  All Cargo Bays must be empty.
   -  The destination must have sufficient resources for the Cargo Bays installed in the rocket.

   When all conditions are met, the Command Capsule will output a Green `Automation`_ 
   signal. Sending a Green automation signal to the Command Capsule's automation 
   input will start the launch.

   In addition to the conditions above, the rocket will not take off if there are 
   solid blocks or buildings obstructing its flight path, such as closed bunker 
   doors, tiles or blocks. Some objects, such as extended `Gantries`_, will not 
   block the rocket, but be heavily damaged or destroyed. Other objects, such as 
   background objects (wires, pipes, etc.) and `Ladders`_ are not directly damaged 
   by rockets, but may liquefy on contact with the rocket's exhaust gases.

   During takeoff, rocket engines (and solid fuel thrusters) expel large quantities 
   of superheated Gas around the Engine. `Steam Engines`_ and `Hydrogen Engines`_ 
   release `Steam`_, while `Petroleum Engines`_ and `Solid Fuel Thrusters`_ release 
   `Carbon Dioxide`_. Additionaly the area below the engine is heated up in a 3x9 
   rectangle. The heat is directly added to the current Heat of whatever tile/gas/liquid 
   is inside of the 3x9 rectangle. The heat applied decreases with distance from 
   the engine, and is slightly higher in the middle column than the outer columns. 
   Heat applied directly by the rocket engine cannot heat anything past 2926.85 °C, 
   although this is still sufficient to melt even tiles made of `Obsidian`_ or 
   `Thermium`_, given enough launches/landings and inadequate cooling.

   Rockets slowly accelerate to reach a top speed of 10 cells per second when 
   launching, and decelerate from that speed when landing.

   Rockets do not require full fuel tanks to launch, but all fuel and oxidizers 
   will be consumed during launch. For this reason, it is optimal to match the 
   fuel and oxidizer loaded into the rocket to the distance you wish to achieve. 
   A tool like the `Professor Oakshell Rocket Calculator`_ can be useful here.

Rocket Return
-------------

   After an expedition, rockets will return to their initial construction location 
   in their entirety, carrying cargo and `Data Banks`_ according to the modules 
   included in the rocket.

   `Space Scanners`_ can be set to detect a returning rocket, which can be used 
   to open `Bunker Doors`_ in preparation for landing.

   Similarly to take-off, rockets produce a large amount of heat during landing, 
   and can damage certain buildings in the way (most notably extended `Gantries`_ 
   and closed bunker doors).

Tips
----

   -  Rocket modules are calculated from top to bottom, this means you can use 
      `Research Modules`_ to discover `Rare Resources`_ and return them on the 
      same launch if you build the `Cargo Bays`_ below the `Research Modules`_.

   -  Engines must be built on solid ground, but the ground can be removed 
      afterwards with no consequence; they will take off as normal and "land" 
      in the air when returning.

   -  It is possible to build multiple rockets on top of each other in a single 
      vertical shaft. Launching lower rockets will not damage the ones above.

   -  All engines and thrusters have a width of 7, while all other modules have 
      a width of 5. However, building tiles on the sides will prevent the rocket 
      from launching.

   -  Decreasing the maximum storage capacity of `Steam Engine`_ or fuel tanks 
      will cause duplicants to remove the extra. Items will be dropped on the 
      ground (liquid fuel in canisters).

   -  Both `Steam Engine`_ and `Liquid Fuel Tank`_ can fit 900 kg of fuel, however 
      due to a single input pipe, the latter can be filled with a single liquid 
      pump in 90 seconds, while the former requires two gas pumps and 900 seconds. 
      When using `Liquid Oxygen`_ for `Liquid Oxidizer Tank`_ (2.7 t capacity) and 
      3 `Liquid Fuel Tanks`_ (900 kg capacity each), rocket can be refueled in 270 
      seconds.

   -  The Heat added below an Engine is quite useful in reaching higher Temperatures. 
      With the proper insulation the area can reach melting Temperatures for most 
      Materials and therefore be used for generating Power with `Steam Turbines`_, 
      losslessly refining `Crude Oil`_, or even melting `Regolith`_.

Setups
------

   Note that cargo modules that allow to bring back resources all weigh 2 tons, 
   while the `Research Modules`_ and `Sight-Seeing Modules`_ weight only 200 kg. 
   These are referred to below as "small modules" and you can replace 10 of them 
   with 1 cargo module.

   -  Using `Steam Engine`_

      -  with no extra thrust

         -  9 small modules to first line of asteroids

      -  with `Solid Fuel Thruster`_

         -  12 small modules to first line
         -  6 small modules to second line

      -  with 2 `Solid Fuel Thrusters`_

         -  2 small modules to third line

   -  Using `Petroleum Engine`_ (which requires `Liquid Fuel Tank`_ and `Solid Oxidizer Tank`_ 
      filled to 1/3 maximum - to match the amount of fuel)

      -  with no extra thrust and fuel tanks

         -  23 small modules to first line
         -  18 small modules to second line
         -  10 small modules to third line

      -  with 1 extra `Liquid Fuel Tank`_ you can bring large container module to as far as 50000 km
      -  with 2 extra `Liquid Fuel Tanks`_ you can bring large container module to 60000 km

   A Solid Booster requires additional 400 kg Iron and 400 kg Oxylite, which is not listed in the table.

Rockets [Space Out]
===================

   https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Rocketry_(Spaced_Out)

   This article contains **outdated information** that is inaccurate for the current version. 
   It was last updated for `EX1-469473`_. Unreflected changes in the discussed game mechanics 
   are detailed here: `U43-525812`_

   *This article is related to DLC content of* `Spaced Out`_\ *.* There is a version of this 
   article for the Base Game, see `Rocket`_. 

   Rockets in the `Spaced Out DLC`_ are multi-component constructs used to explore starmap, 
   and send duplicants and cargo to different planetoids.

Construction
------------

   A `Rocket Platform`_ is the mandatory building on which a rocket is assembled. Modules 
   are added in its menu once they have been researched.

   A rocket requires at least a command module, an engine (with oxidizer possibly) and a 
   nosecone. Engines are always placed at the bottom and nosecones at the top. Additional 
   modules can be built such as cargo to transport goods and rover modules to visit planetoids; 
   they don't have specific order and they can be reorder without deconstruction.

   Due to game limitations, there can only be 16 active command modules at the same time.

Engines
~~~~~~~

   Engines limit how high a rocket can be constructed. Each module has a burdening factor 
   that weighs down the rocket, thus slowing its speed (tiles/cycle it travels). Rocket 
   speed = Engine Power divided by total Burden. Neither burden nor weight affect rocket 
   range, only the amount of burnable fuel available.

   \* While it can take more fuel, it's not possible to have enough Oxidizer for that much fuel.

   \*\* This is only possible with Liquid Oxygen.

Fuel tanks and Oxidizers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Sugar, Petroleum and Hydrogen-propulsed rockets require oxidizer at a ratio of 1:1 
   per kg of fuel when using `Fertilizer`_, 1:2 when using `Oxylite`_, and 1:4 when 
   using `Liquid Oxygen`_.

   Note that the Large Solid Oxidizer Tank is a trap and should never be used because 
   two small Oxidizer tanks have the same capacity but with 1 less height and 1 less burden.

Cargo Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Cargo carry goods from or to asteroids, or fulfill any survival needs of the command 
   capsule. Each module features an external port that corresponds to their specific 
   resource, which is unlocked via the same research as the module variant. This port 
   must be in direct contact with either the rocket platform or another port. Fittings 
   carry anything from a cargo module into the command capsule.

Command Modules and Nosecones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Command modules are required for the rocket to function and only one can be part 
   of any rocket. Solo Spacefarer Nosecone can only be build at the top of the rocket 
   while Spacefarer Module can be build anywhere but takes an extra Basic Nosecone or 
   Drillcone.

Rocket Interior
---------------

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/6/60/Solo_Spacefarer_Nosecone_Interior.png

      Interior of a Solo Spacefarer Nosecone


   Solo Spacefarer Nosecone functions as both the command module and nosecone, and 
   is a total of 28 tiles in size. Spacefarer Module offers a bigger 10x8 interior 
   to be furnished, but does not serve as a nosecone.

Launch
------

   In order for the rocket to launch, the command module checks for various conditions:

   -  A destination must be set.
   -  The rocket cannot have any pending constructions (it can be launched if a lander is not constructed).
   -  A rocket must have an engine and nosecone.
   -  A rocket must have a fuel tank (most engines have a fuel tank included).
   -  Cannot be over rocket engine height limit.
   -  The rocket must be sufficiently fueled to reach the destination (it can be launched even if there is not enough fuel to return).
   -  Cargo transfer must be complete (rocket can still be launched with partially filled cargo).
   -  Skilled crew must be onboard (crew is set through the pop-up and no other passengers are aboard).

Landing
-------

   A rocket cannot land on a planetoid that does not possess a Rocket Platform. If so, 
   a duplicant must be first sent via the `Teleporter Transmitter`_ or in a `Trailblazer`_ 
   to the surface in order to construct one. In the event that multiple rocket platforms 
   are available, the rocket will default to selecting one randomly; alternatively, 
   the player can specify the platform to land on.

Heat and Exhaust
----------------

   All rockets project a large amount of heat onto all cells from the bottom of the 
   engine; the area of projection is a 3x9 rectangle from the exhaust (3x7 from below 
   the Rocket Platform); **this includes cells past walls beneath the platform**.

   Any cells within this area will be superheated, including gases emitted by the 
   engines themselves; the exact amount of heat is unclear, though the following has 
   been observed:

   -  `Carbon Dioxide`_ emissions from `Petroleum`_-using engines can reach above 
      1500 °C with a density up to 6.0 kg per tile.

   -  Squares with 80 to 100 g of `Oxygen`_ (made thin by being vented into regions 
      next to the void of space) can reach more than 2000 °C, suggesting that the 
      projection is a flat heat output instead of heat transfer from a hotter object.

   间歇泉是一种活跃的地质实体。间歇泉在活跃期会间歇地喷出相应物质，在休眠期则停止活动，因此得名。
   间歇泉是重要的物质再生来源，地图上间歇泉的种类显著影响了部分资源的再生难度。此外，许多间歇泉
   在喷发时会产生大量的热，尤其是火山（金属火山），间歇泉的分布情况也对殖民地的能量结构有明显影响。

   所有间歇泉都有一个检测格，它主要影响着间歇泉的喷发。若检测格被固体方块掩埋，则间歇泉不会喷发，
   且复制人也无法执行分析任务；若检测格浸没于压力过高的气体或液体中，间歇泉也不会喷发。间歇泉的
   检测格同时也是物质喷出的位置。

   检测格可用如下方式找到：打开优先度概览，快捷键 P，找到优先度数字正下方的中子质（对常见的 4 格
   中子质基座，一般是左数第二格），向上两格的位置就是检测格。

   **Geysers** are renewable sources of various `materials`_. When active, they 
   alternate between erupting and Idle. The types of geysers, spawned on the map, 
   ultimately decide the economy of the colony.

   A `Duplicant`_ with the Field Research `skill`_ can analyze a geyser in order 
   to figure out its activity duration and dormancy duration.


Dealing with Geysers
--------------------

   Many geysers periodically output a large volume of either heat or troublesome 
   elements when uncovered.

   A geyser is considered covered if the tile two tiles above the middle left 
   `Neutronium`_ tile of the geyser's base is covered. In this state it does not 
   emit anything and cannot be analyzed. Digging out other geyser tiles is safe 
   and can be used to determine the type of the geyser.

   A Geyser's type can also be checked by setting their priority to yellow alert 
   with the Priority Tool, then hovering over the yellow alert.

         A geyser blocked by the only block checked.

   Low temperature geysers can be contained with a simple `Insulated Tile`_ box. 
   Volcanoes require at least inner `obsidian`_ box (most other materials will 
   eventually melt) and some form of `vacuum`_ heat isolation in the long-term.

   All geysers' eruptions can be halted by submerging their second bottom row in 
   liquid. Low pressure geysers can be drowned even by gases, usually they do it 
   to themselves. Partial drowning can also help cool down and recover metals.


Geyser Variants

   每个间歇泉有 5 个独立参数是随机决定的。它们是：喷发周期的平均产率、喷发周期、喷发期在喷发周期
   中的占比、活跃周期、活跃期在活跃周期中的占比。需要特别注意，这里的平均产率并不是游戏文本中的
   （活跃周期的）平均产率。

   对每一类间歇泉而言，这 5 个参数都有各自的上下限。任何同类间歇泉的这些参数都不会超过其上下限。
   具体而言，这些参数的值由以下公式决定。其中，x 是 0~1 之间的（伪）随机数，它由间歇泉的位置决定。

   此间歇泉分布函数的图像为：

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded/images/b/b6/间歇泉分布函数.png/revision/latest?path-prefix=zh
      :width: 100%
   
   可以看出，大部分间歇泉的这 5 个参数都在中间值附近。但是，由此计算出的其他参数可能会显著偏离中间值。
   由这 5 个参数，可以计算间歇泉的其他所有参数。工具 ONI Geyser Calculator（英文）可以帮助计算
   一座间歇泉的产量以及能持续供给的机器/植物数量。

   All geyser types randomly select an average active yield, eruption periods and 
   percentages, and active periods and percentages; these values are picked 
   independently.

   Values in a range are picked based on this formula (`graph by Desmos`_):

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/f0146bbb9d8af25e99a67d9eebea35c1973bf844
      :width: 50%

      .. math:: y = \frac{\log_{e}\left( {\frac{1}{0.995054754x + 0.002472623} - 1.0} \right) + 6}{12}


   where x is a random value from 0 to 1. A value has approximately 50% chance of 
   being in the middle 20%, and these "likely outcome" ranges are shown on the chart. 
   For example: Most cool slush geysers will output between 1400 kg/cycle (= 2333.33 g/s) 
   and 1600 kg/cycle (= 2666.67 g/s) on average while active.

   Possible geyser variants and their parameters are listed in the table below, 
   **except** for the active amount percentage, which is always between 40% and 
   80% (the middle 20% of which is between 56% and 64%). The values for parameter 
   ranges are split across rows, with the top (lighter) cell giving the middle 
   20% of the parameter's range. The *bottom (darker) cell* lists the full range 
   (100%). Columns with names beginning with an asterisk (＊) indicate a *derived value*, 
   or a value which is not one of the main randomized parameters of a geyser but 
   which is *based on* the parameters; the middle 20% threshold for these derived 
   values is based on the middle 20% of their base parameters, *not* on the middle 
   20% of the range of the derived value, because these values do not necessarily 
   scale linearly. The calculation of derived values is discussed below.

Derived Calculations
--------------------

   A geyser's **average active yield** (one of their main randomized parameters) 
   is not shown directly to players; nonetheless, it can be derived quite easily 
   using only the geyser's average overall yield (shown in a fully-analyzed geyser's 
   information window under "average output") and its active amount percentage 
   (which is shown under "active period" - e.g. a geyser active for 48.9 cycles 
   every 76.8 cycles has an active amount percentage of roughly 63.7%):

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/438d8f2dfe281c6e0ff19d3441a11877e66cb4c8

      :math:`\Delta_{active} = \frac{\Delta_{avg}}{\%_{active}}`

   For example: a Copper Volcano which is active for 48.9 cycles every 76.8 cycles 
   and emits 311.8 g/s on average will have an active yield of 311.8 / 0.637 ≈ 490 g/s; 
   multiplying by 600 gives about 293.7 kg/cycle.

   Similarly, it is equally easy to go in reverse: if you have a geyser's average 
   active yield and its active amount percentage, its **average overall yield** is:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/f180281636b1f317454bd8a587c49c830f40acf2

      :math:`\Delta_{avg} = \Delta_{active} \cdot \%_{active}`

   Using the same example as above, a Copper Volcano which is active for 48.9 cycles 
   every 76.8 cycles and emits 490 g/s while active on average will have an average 
   overall yield of 490 * 0.637 ≈ 312 g/s; multiplying by 600 gives about 187.2 kg/cycle.

   Calculating the **eruption rate** of a geyser, which is the rate at which the 
   geyser actually emits its contents, is done similarly using the average active 
   yield (see above) and the eruption amount (which is shown under "eruption period" 
   - e.g. a geyser which erupts for 349 seconds every 719 seconds has an active 
   amount percentage of roughly 48.5%):

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/9ec61ba86cb2220693aa7adfde6dac391b2c3d4f

      :math:`\Delta_{active} = \Delta_{erupting} \cdot \%_{erupting}`

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/699f1d955d79dbf35d66960667fbc584928ebed7

      :math:`\Delta_{erupting} = \frac{\Delta_{active}}{\%_{erupting}}`

   For example, a Steam Vent which emits 3070.9 g/s of Steam for 349s every 719s 
   will have an active yield of 3070.9 * 0.485 ≈ 1489 g/s (893 kg/cycle) - notably 
   higher than the middle 20% for that parameter. If that same geyser is active 
   for 77.5 cycles every 117.6 cycles (≈ 66%), then we can calculate its average 
   overall yield to be 1489 * 0.66 ≈ 982 g/s. (The real geyser these values were 
   taken from had an in-game average overall yield of 982.3 g/s.)

   All geysers are spawned as part of `biomes`_, with a specified amount for each biome.


Open Geysers
------------

   -  `Swamp Biome`_:

      -  One open cool steam vent
      -  One open natural gas vent

   -  `Caustic Biome`_:

      -  One open cool steam vent
      -  One open natural gas OR chlorine vent

   -  `Tide Pool Biome`_:

      -  One open saltwater geyser

   -  `Volcanic Biome`_ on `Rime Asteroid`_:

      -  5 open volcanoes

   -  Volcanoes `World Trait`_

      -  8 open volcanoes


Buried Geysers
--------------

   There are 12 randomly spawned buried geysers in each game. The *Geoactive* 
   `World Trait`_ increases the number to 16, and the *Geodormant* World Trait 
   decreases the number to 9.

   These buried geysers are randomly spawned all over the map, except in the 
   start Biome, `Volcanic Biome`_, and `Space Biome`_. These geysers start 
   covered with `granite`_ and `obsidian`_. In some cases, maps will contain 
   less than what is listed due to points of interest overwriting each-other 
   due to close proximity, especially in the Oil Biome.

   As a convenient rule of thumb, each biome type will only have at most two 
   buried geysers.

Geyser Probabilities
--------------------

   There are 19 unique geysers to pick from for each of the 12 randomly chosen 
   geysers, each having the same chance of selection. This can be broken down 
   into groups:

   -  Water-producing: 6 (PH2O can be cleaned, steam can be cooled)
   -  Oxygen-producing: 2 (PO2 can be cleaned)
   -  Volcanic: 5 (magma, metal)
   -  Metal-producing: 3
   -  Power-producing: 3 (natural gas, leaky oil, hydrogen)

   Ignoring specified geysers (i.e. cool steam vent in swamp), and assuming 9 of 
   the 12 randomly chosen geysers exist on a given world (oil biome geysers tend 
   to not exist), the odds for getting preferred geysers are as follows:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   |             |                Number of preferred geysers                |
   +             +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |             | 1         | 2         | 3         | 4         | 5         |
   +--------+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |        | 1  | 38.53%    | 63.25%    | 78.7%     | 88.09%    | 93.6%     |
   |        +----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |        | 2  | 7.79%     | 24.34%    | 42.77%    | 59.49%    | 73.02%    |
   | Min    +----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   | amount | 3  | 0.96%     | 6.03%     | 15.81%    | 29%       | 43.62%    |
   | wanted +----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |        | 4  | 0.08%     | 1%        | 4.02%     | 10.02%    | 19.12%    |
   |        +----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |        | 5  | 0%        | 0.11%     | 0.71%     | 2.43%     | 5.99%     |
   |        +----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   |        | 6  | 0%        | 0.01%     | 0.08%     | 0.4%      | 1.3%      |
   +--------+----+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

   All listed values assume the number of each preferred doesn't matter (two of 
   the same geyser despite preference for more than 1), the odds of getting 
   multiple distinct geysers will be worse.

   As an example, if a world with at least two volcanoes is desired, it should 
   have a 73.02% chance per world (5 preferred, 2 wanted). If just want one metal 
   volcano is desired, it should have a 78.70% chance per world (3 preferred, 
   1 wanted).

   **Metal Volcanoes** are a special type of `geyser`_ and a renewable, infinite 
   source of `Refined Metals`_. In the Base Game they are always buried, but in 
   the `Spaced Out! DLC`_ they can sometimes spawn uncovered when settling a new 
   `Planetoid`_.

   Like a typical geyser, they alternate between an active state in which they 
   produce their material and an inactive "dormant" state where they do nothing. 
   During the eruption phase, output of liquid metal can be blocked by over-pressurization. 
   The maximum pressure it will output at is 150 kg in a `Gas`_, such as Steam, 
   or when its first two layers are fully submerged in a `Liquid`_, such as its 
   own output. The tile of interest from which the emission comes out from is the 
   exact center tile of the 3 by 3 volcano, which, on the 4 tile `neutronium`_ 
   base is shifted to the left.

   The `Base Game`_ has volcanoes for `Gold`_, `Copper`_ and `Iron`_, while the 
   Spaced Out! DLC introduces volcanoes for `Tungsten`_, `Cobalt`_, `Aluminum`_, 
   `Uranium`_, and `Niobium`_. In Spaced Out!, Niobium Volcanoes are the only 
   renewable source of Niobium.

Metal Volcano Taming
--------------------


Early Game
~~~~~~~~~~


   Dump `Sand`_ in it.

   Compared to `Raw Minerals`_, `Sand`_ has a Heat Capacity higher than `Granite`_ 
   and `Sandstone`_ but lower than `Igneous Rock`_, and a melting point higher 
   than all three. If the Sand melts, it turns into `Liquid Glass`_ which may cool 
   into `Glass`_ debris which can be retrieved.

   As the molten metal transfers its heat to the sand, it will solidify into 
   `Refined Metal`_ and can be delivered to a `Storage Bin`_ in a pool of liquid 
   (such as one of the many `Polluted Water`_ pools in a `Swamp Biome`_) to finish 
   cooling.

   Regularly dumping small amounts of `Sand`_ every few eruptions can be an effective 
   way to create `Glass`_ at a 1:1 ratio, far better than the 4:1 ratio of a `Glass Forge`_ 
   and also not requiring its >1kW electrical grid set-up.

   If `Glass`_ is not sought after, dumping a large amount of `Sand`_ (>30t) can be 
   an easy fire-and-forget option likely to last several dozen cycles and cover an 
   entire Active Period of eruptions. Heat dispersal to the rest of the environment 
   can be prevented by walling the volcano sides with `Insulated Tile`_ and a vacuum 
   atmosphere room with the `Gas Pump`_. Collection of the `Refined Metal`_ could 
   then be handled by an `Auto-Sweeper`_.

Late Game
~~~~~~~~~


   Metal Volcanoes eject their metals in molten form at appropriately hot temperatures. 
   Although **all Metal Volcanoes except Niobium** follow the same rules for their 
   eruption periods and ejection rates, the metals have different ejection temperatures, 
   freezing points, and specific heat capacities, therefore it is unlikely to have a 
   one-size fits all solution which is not wasteful for most volcanoes.

   Any geyser, vent, or, in this case, volcano, cycles through 3 phases. The dormant phase, 
   and the active phase which contains the ejection phase, and the idle phase. And it's 
   important to view it as such, since merely calculating the volcano's average output over 
   its lifetime can still lead to equipment overheating.

   -  During the **Ejection Phase**, Metal and Heat is rapidly introduced into the 
      environment, therefore one needs a **Buffer** to catch the Heat in.

   -  During the **Idle Phase**, all the produced heat from the **Ejection Phase**, 
      stored in the **Buffer** must be moved away to be ready for the next ejection.

   -  And during the **Dormant Phase**, nothing happens, but it can not be relied 
      upon as a large period of time to let the entirety of the setup cool down, 
      that's what the **Idle Phase** should be for.

   By far the best buffer and heat deletion combination is `Water`_ (or rather, 
   `Steam`_) and the `Steam Turbine`_. In perfect conditions, a `Self-Cooled Steam Turbine`_ 
   can delete 292.53kDTU per second.

   To calculate how big of a water buffer must be in place, it is handy to know that 
   the ejected metal exchanges its temperature with the environment much more readily 
   as a `Liquid`_ than as debris.

   To get the Ratio of Ejection amount to buffer size, you first calculate the total 
   amount of heat to be removed from the ejected metal until it solidifies, which is 
   the difference of its Output and Freezing temperature multiplied by its SHC. Then, 
   you divide that number by the amount of heat your buffer medium (water) can take 
   before its temperature leaves the permissible range. In other words, you calculate 
   the difference between the high and the low end of your permissible range and multiply 
   it with the SHC of you buffer medium (which is 4.179 for water). The permissible 
   range for a `self-cooled Steam Turbine`_ is 138°C - 125°C. For a Steam Turbine 
   cooled by `Aquatuners`_ it is 275°C-125°C because steel equipment will break above 
   that temperature. The latter version cuts down the amount of water needed by a 
   factor of 10.

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/f72e9a39cbc1dfe572ed673a62d37fff5aa450b6

      :math:`R = \frac{SHC_{metal} \cdot (T_{output} - T_{freezing})}{SHC_{water} \cdot (138 - 125)}`

   The Ejection amount can be simply multiplied with this ratio (different for 
   every metal) to get the size of the water buffer needed.

   **Examples:**

   -  A Gold Volcano that spews 11kg/s for 27 seconds, with gold's ratio of 3.71, 
      needs about 1150kg of Water.

   -  An Iron Volcano that spews 17kg/s for 22 seconds, with iron's ratio of 8.2, 
      needs about 3100kg of Water.

   -  An Aluminum Volcano that spews 8.2kg/s for 32 seconds, with aluminum's ratio of 17.87, 
      needs about 4700kg of Water.


   To calculate how many `Self-Cooled Steam Turbines`_ are required, first calculate 
   the output that one turbine can take care of by dividing the amount of cooling 
   the Turbine can do (292,53kDTU) by the amount of Heat produced by one gram of metal. 
   Then take the average output over an activity period (not average over lifetime) 
   and round up to the next whole number of turbines:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/f9b5a39b2ff84086d9e876f60423c1e8209f7d61

      :math:`\eta = \frac{292530}{SHC_{metal} \cdot Temp_{metal}}`

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/c43a85a4544a538a2bf3d4f9a2978a0c6b6949e8

      :math:`\Delta_{active} = \frac{\Delta_{erupting} \ast t_{erupting}}{t_{period}}`

      :math:`n_{Turbines}=\left\lceil {\frac {\Delta_{active}}{\eta }}\right\rceil`


   Note that since all metal volcanoes (except Niobium) produce between 200 and 400 kg/cycle, 
   the bounds on Δ\ :sub:`active` will always be between 333.33 and 666.67 g/s; Niobium 
   volcanoes instead produce 800-1600 kg/cycle, so Δ\ :sub:`active` will be between 
   1333.33-2666.67 g/s. Also note that Temp\ :sub:`metal` must be in Kelvin, not in °C 
   (e.g. iron emits at 2526.85 °C = 2800 K, so η = 292530 / (0.449 * 2800) = about 232).

   **Examples:**

   -  A Gold Volcano that spews 11kg/s for 27 seconds every 570 seconds, or 521g/s. 
      One Turbine is needed since it can handle up to 781 g/s:

   -  An Iron Volcano that spews 17kg/s for 22 seconds every 780 seconds, or 479.5g/s. 
      Three Turbines are needed since one can handle up to 232 g/s, two can handle 465 g/s 
      (not quite enough!), and three can handle 698 g/s:

   -  An Aluminum Volcano that spews 8.2kg/s for 32 seconds every 450 seconds, or 583.1g/s. Four Turbines are needed since one can handle up to 160 g/s, so three would be 482g/s and four therefore 642g/s:

   by other metal volcanoes; their eruption patterns resemble that of regular, 
   `magma`_-producing volcanoes- long intervals between eruptions, but emitting 
   massive quantities of very hot, very conductive `Liquid Niobium`_ during eruptions- 
   potentially several hundred kilograms per second. Further complicating things, 
   `Liquid Niobium`_ will form a tile of solid `Niobium`_ when cooled at a mere 
   50kg of mass, well below the volume emitted per second while erupting. This will 
   result in the volcano quickly entombing itself in tiles of `Niobium`_ if conventional 
   methods are used to tame it, providing a unique challenge and necessitating an 
   alternative strategy.

   These calculations are for **self-cooled** steam turbines only. The color of 
   the cells in the last four columns indicate the viability of that many self-cooled 
   turbines for a volcano of that type, with red indicating entirely insufficient 
   for all sizes, orange indicating sufficient for some but not all volcanoes, 
   and green indicating sufficient to handle even the highest-output volcanoes. 
   For turbines being cooled by `Thermo Aquatuners`_ instead (located in the same 
   area as the volcano) then the heat deletion per Turbine can be raised up to 
   1538.05 kDTU/s (at 300°C) at which point a single Turbine is enough to handle 
   any Metal Volcano.

   **Hatches** are terrestrial organisms that play a pivotal role in resource 
   management within the game. These creatures exhibit a remarkable ability to 
   ingest a variety of raw minerals and subsequently convert them into `coal`_, 
   thereby serving as a sustainable source of energy production. Distinct species 
   of Hatches display specific dietary preferences and yield varying outputs, 
   as delineated below:

   -  Regular Hatches: These omnivorous entities are capable of consuming an 
      extensive range of minerals, subsequently excreting coal.

   -  Stone Hatches: Exhibiting a preference for sedimentary rock and granite.

   -  Sage Hatches: These Hatches specialize in the consumption of organic materials, 
      rendering them particularly advantageous for the disposal of surplus polluted dirt.

   -  Smooth Hatches: These creatures feed on metals and are notable for their 
      ability to excrete refined metals.

   -  Metallic Hatches: Distinguished by their consumption of ore, Metallic Hatches 
      excrete a significantly greater quantity of refined metals compared to Smooth Hatches.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

   The Hatch is a nocturnal organism that consumes minerals encountered in its path. 
   During daylight hours, it burrows into natural tiles with a `hardness`_ rating of 
   20 or lower, using these tiles as a hiding place. These natural tiles, including 
   those marked as containing "buried objects," can be excavated to expose the burrowed 
   Hatch. Given the limited number of surface Hatches at the start, excavating the 
   initial biome can facilitate the rapid discovery of additional Hatches.

   Upon death, a Hatch yields 3200 kcal (2 kg) of `meat`_.

   Hatches convert a specific percentage of ingested mass into another resource. 
   For instance, regular Hatches consume 140 kg of solids and transform them into 
   70 kg of coal.


Variants
~~~~~~~~

   The Hatch has four variants, each with its own varied diet preferences. Along 
   with the plain hatch, two of its variations provide a greatly diversified diet 
   that may be better tailored to the needs of your colony's coal production. The 
   final variant provides a refining service that is otherwise heat intensive, 
   power hungry and time consuming.


Hatch
'''''

   |Hatchling Egg| → |Hatchling| → |Hatch|

   The Hatch that is the purple, toothy critter your Duplicants seem to stumble 
   upon in their initial excavations. It eats a wide variety of the same foodstuffs 
   your duplicants subsist on, along with some minerals, and produces coal in return. 
   It provides a minor decor bonus (+10) in its immediate radius. If fed `Sedimentary Rock`_, 
   it has an increased chance of producing a Stone Hatchling Egg. If fed Dirt, it has an 
   increased chance of producing a Sage Hatchling Egg. When killed it provides 2000 g of meat.

Sage Hatch
''''''''''

   |Sage Hatchling Egg| → |Sage Hatchling| → |Sage Hatch|

   Sage Hatch have a glossy green color, and a green diet to match. It consumes 
   almost exclusively organic compounds, including `Polluted Dirt`_, `slime`_, 
   and `algae`_, alongside every normal foodstuff your dupes eat such as `Meal Lice`_. 
   It produces coal in return. It is completely indifferent to bacteria or spoilage, 
   and effectively consumes otherwise spoiled, inedible or over abundant organics 
   your dupes can't use.

   Sage Hatch has the highest conversion rate among all four variants. It can 
   convert 100% consumed mass into `Coal`_.


Stone Hatch
'''''''''''

   |Stone Hatchling Egg| → |Stone Hatchling| → |Stone Hatch|

   Stone Hatch are flinty grey and have a thickened, rocky appearance. They consume 
   primarily mineral materials such as `Igneous Rock`_. They also consume some 
   `Raw Metals`_, such as `Copper Ore`_ or `Iron Ore`_, producing an 25% volume 
   of coal in exchange.

   If fed `Copper Ore`_, `Gold Amalgam`_, `Iron Ore`_, or `Wolframite`_ the Stone 
   Hatch has an increased chance of producing a Smooth Hatch egg.

   This variation is considerably tougher than normal hatch, with more hp and 
   attack, and caution should be used when attempting to kill it as it could 
   severely injure or kill a lone dupe.


Smooth Hatch
''''''''''''

   |Smooth Hatchling Egg| → |Smooth Hatchling| → |Smooth Hatch|

   Smooth Hatch are a deep cobalt blue. They eat metal ore exclusively, and instead 
   of producing coal, they produce `Refined Metal`_ of the corresponding ore instead. 
   They will eat a 100 kg of ore, "refining" it into 75 kg of Refined Metal. They 
   retain the "tougher" stats of the Stone Hatch and thus are dangerous to fight 
   alone should you order your dupes to attack one.


Gold Hatch
''''''''''

   |Gold Hatchling Egg| → |Gold Hatchling| → |Gold Hatch|

   Gold Hatches look similar to Smooth Hatches, but are a distinct golden color. 
   They eat metals in ore and refined form, they produce `Gold`_ or `Gold Ore`_ respectively. 
   They will eat a 100 kg of any metal, "refining" it into 75 kg of Gold. Feeding 
   them 100 kg `Lead`_ will produce 100 kg Gold instead. They retain the "tougher" stats 
   of the Stone and Smooth Hatches and thus are similarly dangerous to fight alone 
   should you order your dupes to attack one. They will eat Gold in it's refined and 
   ore form as well, so the gold needs to be extracted from the stable quickly.

Hatch Farming for Meat and Eggs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   A Duplicant requires 1000kcal per cycle on normal difficulty settings (default). 
   A hatch provides 2,000 grams of meat when slaughtered, which translates to about 
   3,200 kcals of food, 4,000 when cooked into barbecue.

   Happy Hatches take 5.88 cycles to lay an egg. This is roughly 544 kcals in meat 
   (or 680kcal in barbecue) per cycle, meaning in theory you need 1.838 (or 1.47) 
   hatches per dupe. Full time happy Hatches can lay up to 16 eggs over their entire 
   adult life (95 days), one of which will be needed to repopulate the stable; therefore, 
   over a hatch's entire 100 cycles of occupying a stable, it will provide 15 eggs 
   for the colony. This is 480kcal in meat (or 600kcal barbecue) per cycle. In addition 
   to the death of the mother, yields the final 512kcal in meat (or 640kcal barbecue), 
   meaning you need ~1.95 (or ~1.56) hatches per dupe.

   One egg can be cracked into 1,000 grams of raw egg, which can be turned into 2,800 
   kcals of omelette. Since the same calculation holds true as above, this is 420 kcals 
   a day, meaning you need 2.38 hatches per dupe. This feeds about half a dupe less 
   per stable (or one and a half dupes less when cooked to barbecue), requires therefore 
   more space, but can be done with little or no automation and therefore can be done 
   easily early game.


Hatch Coal Herding
''''''''''''''''''

   The goal of setting up this kind of herding operation is to have (Stone) Hatches 
   producing coal at a rapid rate. Each `Coal Generator`_ consumes 600 kg of `Coal`_ 
   a `Cycle`_ when running constantly. You need 8.5 tame and happy (Stone) Hatches 
   to produce 600 kg of coal each cycle. You can fit at most 8 hatches in one `Stable`_, 
   so technically you would need more than one stable to fuel one coal generator 
   constantly. However, usually coal generators don't need to run all the time so 
   your actual requirements may be less.


Hatch Garbage Disposal Herding
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Sage Hatch will eat spoiled, over abundant or bacteria laced food, converting 
   undesired mealwood, spoiled food, polluted dirt or slime into Sage Hatchling 
   eggs and meat alongside a limited supply of coal. They make for delicious `Barbeque`_ 
   and a consistent stream of eggs (one every 6 cycles roughly). Your Ranch room 
   should have a separate hatchery adjoining it to provide constant hatch rearing. 
   Typically a herd of 7 will run one generator, which can provide the power to a 
   couple incubators.

Hatch Refinery Herding
''''''''''''''''''''''

   Smooth hatch refine metals, more efficiently than a `Rock Crusher`_, but less so 
   than a `Metal Refinery`_. While it takes some investment to breed a Smooth hatch, 
   once obtained they can provide a reliable source of refined metal, without needing 
   power and a dupes time, apart from grooming if needed, and without generating 
   large amounts of heat. Careful estimation of just how much refined metal you 
   need should be made, and the number of hatch should be carefully managed unless 
   you wish to find yourself running out of ore. 3 - 4 Smooth hatch can produce 
   enough refined metal for most early - mid game needs. They continue producing 
   eggs like other hatch sub-species, though caution must be exercised when harvesting 
   full grown Smooth hatch for meat - they can incapacitate a lone unskilled dupe easily. 
   As such, if smooth hatches are also ranched for meat, use of a `Drowning chamber`_ is 
   recommended.

History
~~~~~~~

   -  `R1-260847`_: Hatches can now be `Ranched`_.
   -  `R2-264752`_: Introduced hatch variants.
   -  `RU-284571`_: Smooth Hatches can now be obtained from space missions to the 
      `Metallic Asteroid`_, and Stone Hatches from space missions to the `Rocky Asteroid`_.
   -  `LU-357226`_: Hatch diets now include `Aluminum Ore`_ and `Electrum`_
   -  `U51-600112`_: Hatches can no longer be `Ranched`_.

   **Pacu** is an aquatic `Critter`_ found in pools in the `Swamp Biome`_. They 
   produce `Pacu Fillets`_ and `Eggs`_, and their morphs can provide either fresh 
   `Water`_ or `decor`_ bonuses. They can be domesticated.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

   Pacu spends its time floating around in the pool of Polluted Water in which 
   it was created. They only produce a single egg before expiring, which occurs 
   in only 25 cycles. These pacific critters can only be captured and moved in 
   an aquatic `Fish Trap`_, which complicates domesticating them early on in the 
   game. Alternatively, their eggs can be sweeped into a storage container in 
   another target location.

   Their death provides 1,000 kcal of `Pacu Fillet`_, which can be cooked into 
   1,600 kcal of `Cooked Seafood`_ at an `Electric Grill`_.

   Once placed in a pool, feeding from a `Fish Feeder`_ will slowly domesticate 
   the Pacu over roughly 10 cycles. Its feeding and reproductive behavior drastically 
   change once domesticated: it begins gorging itself on Algae or seeds, and rapidly 
   laying out eggs (one roughly every 1 1/2 cycles) and defecating. This continues 
   until the pool becomes overcrowded, at which point the Pacu returns to its typical 
   behavior; so a single domesticated Pacu can result in an extremely large population 
   very quickly.

   Their room size is calculated based on the amount of liquid tiles around them. 
   Each Pacu requires 8 tiles each to not become overcrowded. Liquid inside and 
   sectioned off by `Mesh Tiles`_ and `Pneumatic Doors`_ are counted and are treated 
   as one homogeneous pool of liquid with the surrounding liquid.

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/4/4b/-5EC17CD7-D23B-4D9E-B2CD-D4626199843B-.png

      Despite having a lot of space to itself, the pacu on the left is 
      overcrowded because of the pacus in the right section


   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/a/a7/-00AB831D-E13C-462B-B99E-9A97EC7E635C-.png

      The 3 Pacus are happy because the pool size is 6x4, even though 
      physically they are trapped by pneumatic doors in a 1x4 area


   Pacu only swims in tiles over 350 kg and have trouble swimming in different liquids. 
   This might make it so the Pacu can't reach the Fish Feeder or can be used to limit 
   Pacu movement. The pathing of Pacu can make a significant game performance impact, 
   so limiting their movement with creative liquid management while keeping them happy 
   may be considered.

   Pacu require more than 350 kg of liquid in a tile to swim; below that, the critter 
   is considered to be *flopping*, and can visibly be seen to flop about on the ground. 
   Even though the description reads "*Fish out of water*" when the Pacu is flopping, 
   it suffers no health loss from it, being able to essentially *flop* for its full lifespan.

   All Pacu have a mass of 200 kg when hatched and when they reach adulthood. Newly born 
   Pacu have body temperatures which are specific to their variant, resulting in heat 
   creation/deletion.

Variants
~~~~~~~~

   The Pacu is a temperature sensitive critter with two additional variants. Provided 
   the fish is placed in a pool of the correct temperature, it produces its variants 
   consistently and quickly. They all maintain the Pacu's feeding and breeding behaviors, 
   keeping all three variants tied for the most reliable source of eggs in the game.

Pacu
''''

   |Fry Egg| → |Pacu Fry| →  |Pacu|

   The classic pale green Pacu.

   When Pacus hatch and reach adulthood, (which takes about 5.5 cycles,) their 
   temperature is 30 °C.

Tropical Pacu
'''''''''''''

   |Tropical Fry Egg| → |Tropical Fry| → |Tropical Pacu|

   The colorful Tropical Pacu is the most frequently spotted variant morph of 
   the Pacu. They emerge when a Pacu reproduces at a temperature above 35 °C. 
   They provide a +25 decor out to a radius of 5 squares but this decor only 
   penetrates `Window Tile`_.

   When Tropical Pacus hatch and reach adulthood, their temperature is 55 °C.

Gulp Fish
'''''''''

   |Gulp Fry Egg| → |Gulp Fry| → |Gulp Fish|

   The blue Gulp Fish is the second variant of the Pacu. They emerge when a Pacu 
   reproduces at a temperature below 5 °C. They also have the drawback of requiring 
   temperature management - too hot and they die off, too cold and the pool they 
   are in starts to freeze. They do, however, convert Polluted Water into Water, 
   at a slow and consistent pace of 200 g/s. A large pool filled with these critters 
   can produce enough fresh water to support a base though water needs to be siphoned 
   off quickly thanks to its higher freezing point than Polluted Water. Alternatively, 
   if the Polluted Water is cold enough the water that the Gulp Fish produces will 
   instantly freeze into `Ice`_, which can be collected and melted.

   The water that Gulp Fish produce matches their internal body temperature, which 
   can cause heat creation/deletion depending on a Gulp Fish's temperature relative 
   to the Polluted Water that it takes in.

   When Gulp Fish hatch and reach adulthood, their temperature is -12.5 °C.

Pacu `Ranching`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tamed Pacu
''''''''''

   A newly-born tame Pacu will live long enough to lay an egg even if not fed, 
   similar to Wild Pacu, provided it has enough space.

   It is possible to sustain a single Pacu-breeder via `Algae Distiller`_ - `Pufts`_ 
   pathway. One Pacu requires 7.5 kg of `Algae`_ per cycle. The 7.5 kg of Algae 
   require 22.5 kg of slime per cycle, which can be covered with some excess by 1 
   tame Puft. This in turn would need 50 kg of Polluted Oxygen per cycle. Off-gassing 
   such an amount from polluted water would require a surface area of around 188 tiles 
   (Puft will require at least 144 tiles on their own to not get overcrowding effects). 
   It can be supplemented by `Polluted Oxygen Vents`_ and Morbs, although Morbs' production 
   rates are inconsistent. Pacu can also be fed `Seeds`_, requiring 1 of any seed per cycle. 
   Excess seeds from food crops or a `Thimble Reed`_ farm could be all you need to maintain 
   a Pacu farm.

   Two consistently-fed Pacus maintain one tame `Pokeshell`_.

   Farming is more feasible if you can find a way to heavily optimize the system and 
   reduce the algae consumption. Otherwise it will rapidly deplete your algae reserves. 
   With automation and by limiting the amount stored in the Fish Feeder it is possible 
   to feed a single Pacu only a few kilograms of algae per cycle. The Pacu will eventually 
   starve, but until around age 10 it will live of its internal energy store and continuously 
   lay eggs. After that it will intermittently starve, but still have its reproduction 
   increased for a short time directly after a feeding. The length of the starvation and 
   with that the amount of additional eggs can be adjusted by choosing to feed it more algae. 
   The number of produced eggs is thus less than if fed the maximum, but the far lower amount 
   of algae used makes this an economical tradeoff.

   An alternative option is to use seeds in your Fish Feeder, as these can be easily 
   gained from a dedicated farm or just from the passive duplication in your colonies 
   other farms. When making a dedicated farm for the Pacu there are 2 main options, 
   the `Balm Lily`_ can work well due to the lack of a fertilizer requirement and so 
   only needs the dupe labor to harvest. As mentioned above, `Thimble Reed`_ is a 
   great alternative due to its fast growth speed and minimal requirements.

Wild Pacu
'''''''''

   The Pacu's short lifespan and relatively large food output makes wild Pacu an easy 
   source of food. It will produce one egg throughout its life even when unfed, while 
   dropping fillets for your Duplicants to eat when they die at no resource costs.

   Note that wild Pacu can still become Cramped if they are overcrowded when one lays 
   an egg. This can be avoided by moving the egg into another room. A line of open 
   `Pneumatic Doors`_ along the bottom of the pool can rectify this by causing 
   freshly-laid eggs to drop out of the room.

   An easy way to move Pacu is to move their eggs instead, via an `Automatic Dispenser`_, 
   a `Conveyor Chute`_ or by moving the eggs to a `Storage Bin`_ in or near the pool and 
   then unassigning storage from the bin, causing the eggs to drop.

Tips
~~~~

   -  Wild, uncrowded Pacu will lay an egg when they are 20 cycles old. 
      The parent can die just before the egg hatches.

   -  An adult, wild Pacu can be tamed in less than 8 cycles and taming from 
      the egg takes under 12 cycles, using as little as 480 kg of Algae.

   -  Creative automation can be used to tame Pacu using less Algae by limiting 
      the Fish Feeder.

   -  Eggs retain the wildness of the parent at the time the egg is laid.

   -  Pacu Fry will only eat once from a Fish Feeder only containing Seeds.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

   Shine Bugs are relatively rare, with two or three spawning in the temperate biome. 
   They are commonly found in places with lots of `Mealwood`_, `Bristle Blossoms`_, 
   `Bluff Briar`_ and `Muckroots`_. They are quick lived, but reproduce slowly when 
   wild if unable to find `Bristle Berry`_ to consume. They can drown in water and 
   can be killed by being entombed or by attacking them.

   Shine Bugs are quite lonely critters, as only a few exist in the meteoroid, so they 
   constantly seek each other, and sometimes mistake duplicant-made lighting as new 
   friends, bobbing up and down in greeting. They are, however, attracted to things 
   emitting light, and are more likely to move towards things such as lamps, light 
   bulbs, or other shine bugs. Shine bugs will consume any `Gristle Berry`_ or 
   `Bristle Berry`_ that is found lying around. They seem oblivious to the atmosphere 
   in which they're kept, although temperature extremes will prove lethal to them.

   Shine bugs enjoy the largest array of variants that can be unlocked through 
   `Ranching`_, each variant requiring a different foodstuff and providing a 
   progressively increased benefit. They must be raised successively, with each 
   generation providing a chance to produce the next when provided with the 
   correct foodstuff.

   They are as follows:

   *  Shine Bug:  |Shine Nymph Egg| → |Shine Nymph| → |Shine Bug|

      The original variant consumes `Bristle Berry`_, `Gristle Berry`_ and `Phosphorite`_. 
      They provide illumination and moderately improve decor (+30) in a modest 5 tile radius. 
      They are short lived, but reproduce quickly with a 67% per cycle reproduction rate 
      when tamed and fed. If fed `Gristle Berry`_, they have an increased chance of producing 
      Sun Nymph eggs.

      Shine Bugs emit light at 1800 `Lux`_ while uncrowded.


   *  Sun Bug:  |Sun Nymph Egg| → |Sun Nymph| → |Sun Bug|

      The second possible variant, Sun Bugs are orange in coloration and continue 
      providing illumination and a high decor bonus (+50), as well as increase its 
      radius to 7 tiles. They eat Fried Mushroom, Gristle Berry, Mushroom 
      and Phosphorite. If fed `Fried Mushroom`_, they have an increased chance 
      of producing Royal Nymph Eggs.

      Sun Bugs emit light at 1800 `Lux`_ while uncrowded.

   *  Royal Bug:  |Royal Nymph Egg| → |Royal Nymph| → |Royal Bug|

      The third variant, `Royal Bugs`_ are a royal purple and provide the same 
      decor bonus as Sun Bug. They eat Fried Mushroom, Gristle Berry, Pepper Bread, 
      Phosphorite and Pincha Peppernut. If fed `Pepper Bread`_, they have an increased 
      chance of producing Coral Nymph Eggs.

   *  Coral Bug:  |Coral Nymph Egg| → |Coral Nymph| → |Coral Bug|
   
      The fourth variant, Coral Bugs are a pink hue and provide the same decor 
      value and radius as Royal Bug. They eat Bristle Berry, Fried Mushroom, 
      Gristle Berry, Pepper Bread, Phosphorite and Stuffed Berry. If fed `Stuffed Berry`_ 
      they have an increased chance of producing Azure Nymph Eggs_.

   *  Azure Bug:  |Azure Nymph Egg| → |Azure Nymph| → |Azure Bug|

      The fifth variant, Azure Bugs are a dark blue hue and the same decor value 
      and radius as the Coral Bug. They eat Pepper Bread, Phosphorite, Phosphorus 
      and Stuffed Berry. If fed `Phosphorus`_, they have an increased chance of 
      producing Abyss Nymph eggs.

   *  Abyss Bug:  |Abyss Nymph Egg| → |Abyss Nymph| → |image40|
   
      The sixth variant, Abyss Bugs are a translucent black hue. They have a very 
      high decor value (+80) with a 7 tile radius, but no longer produce light, 
      which by itself would provide a decor value of +15. They live considerably 
      longer than previous variants, tripling their lifespan to 75 cycles, but 
      also greatly reduce their reproductive rate to 22% per cycle. This means 
      that Abyss Bugs (and Radiant Bugs) will not be able to lay an egg before 
      they die of starvation, if tame but not fed. They eat Abyssalite, Barbeque, 
      Meat, Phosphorus and Stuffed Berry. If fed `Barbeque`_, they have an increased 
      chance to produce Radiant Nymph eggs.

   *  Radiant Bug:  |Radiant Nymph Egg| → |Radiant Nymph| → |image42|

      The seventh and final variant, Radiant Bugs are colorlessly translucent. 
      They have an astoundingly high decor value (+200) with a 8 tile radius, 
      produce light with a 5 tile radius, and keep the extended life and reduced 
      reproduction rates of the Abyss Bug. They eat Barbeque and Diamond. They 
      will almost always produce more Radiant Nymph eggs, with a tiny chance to 
      produce an original Shine Nymph Egg.

Tips
~~~~


Shine Bug Decor Farming
'''''''''''''''''''''''

   You can take advantage of the fact that variants between Sun and Azure bugs 
   (included) provide the exact same decor benefit and go arbitrarily high on 
   the variant chain in the dedicated breeding room, then set up a critter 
   drop-off for shine bugs outside of any room but still somewhere in your base, 
   as well as a critter feeder filled with Phosphorite and allowing your preferred 
   types, thus getting a high amount of sources of decor to roam everywhere around 
   your base. They need to be tame so that they don't leave the corridor and get 
   stuck in a low traffic area, inhospitable climate, or a mushroom farm where 
   their presence is harmful.

   Note this setting up does not apply to barracks and bed rooms as the light will 
   disturb Duplicants' sleep. However, since the abyss bug variant does not produce 
   light, they can be effectively used to boost decor within sleeping quarters. 
   Because of this, it may be worthwhile to keep an abyss bug stable as well as 
   a radiant bug stable around so that the abyss bugs can be used to boost decor 
   in rooms that must be kept dark.


Radiant Bug Breeding
''''''''''''''''''''

   Feeding all shine bug variants (with the exception of the abyss bug and radiant 
   bug variants) phosphorite will always provide a 2% chance to produce an egg of 
   the next shine bug variant. Thanks to the shine bug's extremely fast reproduction 
   speed (2 eggs every 3 cycles), radiant bug variants can be ranched reasonably 
   quickly off just a diet of phosphorite (50 eggs, a ranch of 8 will produce 
   these in just over 9 cycles). Care must be taken to quickly clear stables of 
   eggs to prevent the cramped debuff from slowing down egg production. In this way, 
   the abyss and radiant bug variants can be bred in about 40 cycles. It is still 
   much faster to feed the variants the specialized diet, as it allows you to skip 
   breeding a shine bug variant entirely as their egg chance rises to above 90% 
   after just two or three meals.

   Once the abyss bug variant is bred, it is recommend to keep a separate stable 
   of abyss bugs fed off a diet of abyssalite before moving on the radiant bug 
   variant. Since the goal is most likely decor farming, the abyss bug's lack of 
   light production makes it useful for boosting decor in rooms that must be kept 
   dark, such as bedrooms and mushroom farms.


   Another downside of feeding radiant bugs off barbeque is that it will occupy 
   an electric grill, taking away time that could be spent making other food. 
   Remember, 8 radiant bugs consumes as much barbeque as 32 duplicants!

   When feeding abyss or radiant bugs barbeque, it is highly recommend to set the 
   critter feeder storage to 8 kg or lower to minimize the amount of barbeque that 
   spoils, and to raise to priority to keep it stocked. This is not necessary if 
   the stable is kept in a sterile environment, of course.

   An abyss bug will only need to be fed barbeque a small number of times to produce 
   the radiant bug variant. Once radiant bugs are hatched, you can stop feeding 
   the Abyss Bugs Barbeque. The seed group of abyss bugs will retain their radiant 
   bug egg lay chance when fed abyssalite, and as such can produce cheap radiant 
   bug eggs until the end of their life. Because of this, a cheap way to produce 
   many radiant bugs is using seed groups of abyss bugs. A second stable of abyss 
   bugs can be created so that the abyss bugs are briefly fed barbeque to get their 
   radiant bug egg lay chance up, and once their egg lay chances are sufficiently 
   high, to switch their diet to abyssalite. The abyss bugs that die in this radiant 
   seed stable can be replaced by the eggs produced by the other dedicated abyss bug 
   stable. The resultant radiant bug eggs can be incubated and distributed around 
   the base. 
   
   However, these radiant bugs will most likely starve before they reproduce, 
   so new radiant bugs will need to be produced to replace them. As such, this method, 
   while cheaper, requires more user intervention (periodically refreshing the abyss 
   bug seed group). The user would have to repopulate the seed stable every 75 cycles 
   and closely monitor the stable until the abyss bugs are laying mostly radiant bug eggs. 

   Additionally, although this may not have too much of an impact, the user also loses 
   out on the massive decor provided by a dedicated radiant bug stable. If there is 
   sufficient diamond on the map (spare 10 tons), or if a steady stream of barbeque 
   can be guaranteed, then the extra effort and loss of decor may not justify the 
   cost savings.

   Despite their immense resource investment, radiant bugs and abyss bugs provide 
   an excellent return, as abyss bugs can greatly boost decor in bedrooms, and 
   radiant bugs can greatly boost decor everywhere, cancelling out even the decor 
   malus from heavi-watt wire.

   For reference, the decor boost from ranching radiant bugs and distributing them 
   around base give rooms a decor bonus of 2,000 - 3,000. This is so high that a 
   duplicant only needs to spend two or three scheduling blocks in such a room and 
   have an average cycle decor of over 120 even if they spend the rest of their time 
   inside a power sauna or around other industrial machinery whose average decor is 
   around negative 400.

   Once Radiant Bugs are bred and their distribution areas surrounded by window tile, 
   there is utterly no reason to invest in any other form of decor aside from room 
   requirements.

   Care must be taken when distributing radiant bugs in kitchen areas, some hungry 
   radiant bugs may steal your dupes' freshly grilled barbeque if it is not stored 
   quickly enough. On the plus side, if this happens, the radiant bug will live long 
   enough to reproduce once as long as it is not cramped or overcrowded.

   In certain cases, when large amounts of critters are ranched (for example, having 
   half a dozen stables of slicksters to recycle carbon dioxide), excessive amounts 
   of meat and barbeque are produced and can potentially cause problems with storage 
   space, or spoiling and causing other problems. In this case, radiant bugs may prove 
   useful for clearing away 3,000,000 kcals of barbeque to prevent food spoilage issues.

   Ironically enough, the decor boost from the radiant bugs can help boost duplicants' 
   morale sufficiently enough so that they can subsist on lower tier foods without 
   becoming stressed, freeing up additional barbeque.

   Radiant bugs are unsuitable for Shine Bug reactor farming; it is recommended to 
   use the sun variant for this purpose.


Medicine Herding
''''''''''''''''

   The goal of this setting up is to produce `Sun Nymph Eggs`_ with Sun Bugs. 
   Sun Nymph Egg can be used to make `Serum Vial`_, which cures `Zombie Spores`_.



Shine Bug Reactor Farming
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This method uses Shine Bugs as a virtually unlimited solar power source. It relies 
   on the fact that Shine Bugs have a high reproduction rate, that their light can 
   power a `Solar Panel`_, and the fact that critters will not believe they are in 
   a confined space if they are confined with a `Liquid Airlock`_ to a 1x1 tile, as 
   liquid airlocks do not register as walls of a room.

   Create a 3*3 box of Window Tiles, sealing one of the sides with a liquid airlock 
   and the top with a pneumatic door. Solar panels can then be placed below and to 
   the sides of this box, and a conveyor chute can drop eggs into the box through 
   the pneumatic door. A standard Phosphorite or other duplicant tended Shine Bug 
   farm can then be used to seed this box with Shine Bugs. Once seeded, the Shine 
   Bugs will continue to reproduce as quickly as they die off, as their 7% reproduction 
   rate allows them to reproduce once before they starve.

   The box can continue to be seeded until the room containing the reactor reaches 
   its critter limit, or the solar panels reach their maximum capacity (50-100 Shine 
   Bugs will max out a Solar Panel depending on whether it is beside or below the 
   reactor), at which point another reactor can be built.

   Note that once filled, the overlapping light of the Shine Bugs will render their 
   light radius pure white, producing a sort of artificial sun. This can make it 
   difficult to see or edit the reactor. The number of Shine Bugs however, can be 
   read using the decor overlay.

   Since this method simply uses a farm's extra eggs, it can easily be coupled with 
   other techniques for gaining benefit from Shine Bugs.

   **Power** is needed to run `machinery <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Building>`__ 
   in a subterranean asteroid `colony <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Colony>`__.

   Generators can produce power automatically, but they will consume various 
   `resources <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Resource>`__ 
   (in case of `renewables <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Renewable_Energy>`__: 
   heat above 125 °C and `daylight <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Light>`__).

   All carbon burners produce 110+ `°C <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Units>`__ 
   hot `Carbon Dioxide <https://oxygennotincluded.fandom.com/wiki/Carbon_Dioxide>`__

Batteries
~~~~~~~~~


   **Batteries** store extra power that your duplicants create. They must be tied 
   via power wires to run. They are used when no power is currently produced until 
   they run out of stored power. Batteries are not limited in their output, if the
   network currently demands more than the wire can support even one battery can 
   overload the wire.

   Batteries slowly discharge when not in use. The amount of discharge (called 
   "Power runoff") depends on the battery type.

   Although not a battery themselves, power transformers also store some power - 
   with the benefit that they do *not* discharge over time.

   |                 | category `Sound Amplifiers`_. Smart Batteries store 20 kJ of electricity,   |
   |                 | less than the Jumbo Battery, but they can utilize `Automation`_ to          |
   |                 | manage your power grid, i.e by turning off a power-producing building       |
   |                 | so it doesn't waste resources generating power when nothing can accept it.  |

   against overload damage or to force power into another circuit. It works as a 
   buffer between circuits, providing up to 1000 W from its internal battery to one 
   circuit while consuming power from the other circuit. Since the output is limited, 
   it can safely convert power from a higher wattage source (e.g. `Heavi-Watt Wire`_, 
   which can carry up to 20 kW) down to a lower wattage (e.g. `Wire`_, which can only 
   carry up to 1 kW). Multiple transformers can be connected on a circuit as either 
   consumer or producer.

Usage
~~~~~


   Transformers have an input side (the upper attachment point) and an output side 
   (the lower attachment point). Typically, high-power circuits should enter the 
   transformer through its upper input, and will output up to 1 kW on the output side.

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/4/4d/Transformers.png

      |Transformers.png|


   Typically, generators and `Batteries`_ will be attached on a Heavi-Watt Wire grid, 
   giving them a 20 kW capacity (allowing up to 33 `Coal Generators`_). Multiple 
   transformers can then be attached to supply power consumers attached to a lower 
   wattage cable able to cross tiles.

   In this scenario, batteries on the output side of the transformers would be avoided, 
   as batteries have no limit to output rate. A transformer can resist damage when power 
   draw crosses above 1 kW, but a battery can cross that limit and overload a circuit.

   Alternatively, transformers can be used to draw power from a low wattage circuit 
   attached to multiple power producers and output into a higher wattage circuit. 
   This would protect the lower circuit from overload while still providing to the 
   main power circuit and benefitting from the advantages of using low wattage cables.

Notes
~~~~~


   -  Transformers will operate without any power cost or charge loss unless disabled 
      by `automation`_ or disconnected from an output circuit. In which case, the 
      internal battery will rapidly drain.

   -  Automation can be used to interrupt power flow in the same way as `Switches`_ 
      and `Power Shutoffs`_. However, this will cause power runoff.

   -  Two transformers drawing from a high wattage input can be paired to fully 
      provide for a `Conductive Wire`_ grid safe from overloading.

   -  A power transformer will produce heat as long as it contains some energy, 
      irrespective of the power input/output.

   -  The internal battery is limited to a recharge rate of 1 kW (or 200 J per 
      game tick) and acts as a regular battery.

      -  On its own, the battery of a transformer will limit the available 
         power to 1 kW and prevent overload. However, if more batteries or 
         transformers are connected, the increased available power may cause 
         overload damage to happen.

   **Large Power Transformer** is intended to separate two circuits to protect 
   the circuit at output side from overload damage. Like the `Power Transformer`_, 
   it works as a buffer between generators and primary circuits, but allowing 
   4 kW on those primary circuits instead of 1 kW.

Usage
~~~~~


   Transformers have an input side (the upper attachment point) and an output 
   side (the lower attachment point). High-power circuits should enter the 
   transformer through its upper input, and will output *up to* 4 kW on the 
   output side as long the input side can support it.

   **Solar Panel** is a building that can convert `light`_ into `power`_. The more 
   light it receives, the more power it generates. 380 W is the maximum power it 
   can generate, and it has to have a total Lux coverage of 350 000 (7 tiles * 50 000 
   on each tile). Covering a tile will cause less power to generate as the power 
   generated is based on total Lux received. Requires more Lux per tile to reach 
   full output (6 tiles * ~58 000)


   It has two separate panels and one panel is three tiles wide, however they have

Usage
~~~~~


   While their mechanics are straightforward, in the base game, using Solar Panels 
   requires heavy investment in infrastructure.

   Solar Panels cannot withstand `Meteor`_ strikes, `overheat`_ as easily as generic 
   buildings, and there is no building materials that could mitigate it. This means 
   they have to be protected both from direct damage and hot materials falling on them.

   -  Transparent tiles, such as `Window`_, `Airflow`_ or `Mesh`_ can be used to 
      separate hot `Regolith`_ from Solar Panels. However by themselves they cannot 
      withstand Meteor hits either and will require a lot of manual labor and 
      constant material investment to regularly break up solid `Regolith`_ tiles 
      and fix accumulated damage.

      -  Window Tiles also partially block light, reducing Solar Panel's 
         efficiency by about 10%. They also soak heat from `regolith`_ 
         and might transfer it to machinery.

      -  `Robo-Miners`_ can help with `regolith`_ dismantling, but will 
         require cooling and protection themselves.

   -  `Bunker Doors`_ can serve as reliable upper line of defense, but they require 
      `automation`_ setup involving `Space Scanners`_, which are complicated by themselves.

   Meteor storms also decrease the amount of solar power generated each `cycle`_, 
   because either accumulated `regolith`_ tiles or closed Bunker Doors will block 
   panels from receiving light. Badly timed meteor shower can block almost an entire 
   cycle's worth of sunlight.

   The second issue with solar power is its cyclical nature. If there are no other 
   power sources to use as backup, each Solar Panel would need 9 `Smart Batteries`_ 
   or 5 `Jumbo Batteries`_ to compensate for the worst-case downtime. 

   `More on Solar output`_. :sup:`[confirmation?]`


Mechanics
~~~~~~~~~


   The power generated by a solar panel scales linearly with the total illuminance 
   (in lux) incident across its tiles. The total lux that falls on a solar panel 
   is the sum of the lux incident on each of the panel's tiles, for example a lux 
   of 10,000 on each of the solar panel's 7 tiles sums to a total illuminance of 
   70,000 lux (10,000 lux/tile * 7 tiles).

   Maximum output of 380 W requires a total lux of 350,000. Therefore, the power 
   output of a solar panel can be computed as a function of total lux:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/554569d367d9b8f58e2e58414b892c1a9300bea2

      :math:`P = 380W\frac{\min(T_{lux},350000lx)}{350000lx}`


   Where :math:`P` is the power produced by the solar panel, and :math:`T_{lux}` 
   is the total illuminance (in lux) incident on the solar panel.


Illuminance from sunlight throughout a cycle
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


   The day-night cycle results in a varying intensity of sunlight, ranging from 
   0 lux at night to a peak of 80,000 lux at midday (see `Light`_). The illuminance 
   on a single tile from sunlight at any given time in a 600 second cycle can be 
   determined by the following:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/4e2c8ac90f8fc91a5482b358545757cd8e0fb335

      :math:`E_{v} = \max\left( {80000lx \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi \cdot \tau}{525s} \right),0} \right)`

   Where :math:`E_{v}`is the illuminance (in lux) that falls on each tile from sunlight, 
   and :math:`\tau` is the time of day in seconds, ranging from 0 to 600 for each cycle.


Average power across a cycle using sunlight
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


   For a solar panel in unobstructed direct sunlight (e.g. in the vacuum of space with 
   no light-blockers above it), its power output will vary as solar illuminance changes 
   with the cycle.

   #. At night, solar panels produce no power.

   #. During the morning, solar panels ramp up power until solar illuminance 
      reaches 50,000 lux, at which point the maximum output of 380 W is reached.

   #. Solar illuminance continues to rise to a peak of 80,000 lux at midday, 
      but solar panels will continue to produce their maximum output of 380 W.

   #. Solar illuminance begins dropping after midday. Once illuminance drops 
      below 50,000 lux, the power produced by solar panels begins to ramp down 
      until nighttime.

   This assumes no interruption in solar illumination due to meteor showers, which 
   is the default case in the `Spaced Out DLC`_.

   Combining the above two formulae, this process can be modeled with the following 
   to compute the power generated for a given time of day:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/dced155aa87d4a43ced434de3f3a38755d61011c

      :math:`P(\tau) = 380W\frac{\min(7 \cdot E_{v},350000lx)}{350000lx} = 380W\frac{\min(\max\left( {560000lx \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi \cdot \tau}{525s} \right),0} \right),350000lx)}{350000lx}`


   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/bc154f29ce17eeeeff77df65927c544f648a243c

      :math:`\;\Longrightarrow\; P(\tau) = 380W \cdot \min\left( {\max\left( {1.6 \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi \cdot \tau}{525s} \right),0} \right),1} \right)`

   Integrating with respect to time :math:`\tau`, the total energy in 
   joules produced by a solar panel in a single cycle can be found:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/2a32a9adea366e47d64498b0528532bf5d70af0b

      :math:`\int_{0s}^{600s}{380W \cdot \min\left( {\max\left( {1.6 \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi \cdot \tau}{525s} \right),0} \right),1} \right)}{d\tau} \approx 158334J`

   Given that each cycle lasts 600 seconds, this gives an 
   **average power output of ~264 W across a cycle** for a 
   single solar panel with an unobstructed view of space.


Common averages
'''''''''''''''


   In the Spaced Out DLC, peak sunlight varies depending on the type of asteroid. 
   Here is a list of common values found throughout clusters.

Determining storage capacity to last the night
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


   A grid containing both solar panels and fuel-based electricity can automate 
   the power generators using `Smart Batteries`_ to save fuel. This allows solar 
   power to be fully integrated with very little energy storage.

   If no other form of energy generation is present, then to provide a constant 
   264 W of power per solar panel throughout an entire cycle, power must be 
   stored during the day so it can be released during the night when solar power 
   production stops.

   The total energy storage required (in joules) is equal to the *excess* energy 
   generated during the day beyond the 264 W average. Or, equivalently, it is 
   equal to the *deficit* of solar energy below the average 264 W due to the late 
   evening / night / early morning when solar power production drops.

   To compute the energy generated during the day in excess of the 264 W average, 
   it is sufficient to consider the energy generated *within* the average 264 W 
   envelope, and subtract it from the total energy generated during the cycle.

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/fa4c640942b2f68e616d63bff2378f827c82f209

      :math:`\frac{P_{average}}{P_{peak}} = \frac{264W}{380W} \approx 0.69`

   | 
   | Substituting this in, gives:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/03ae045301cb297ceb4b237748a031bf01c66afa

      :math:`\int_{0s}^{600s}{380W \cdot \min\left( {\max\left( {1.6 \cdot \sin\left( \frac{\pi \cdot \tau}{525s} \right),0} \right),0.69} \right)}{d\tau} \approx 119083J`

   And subtracting from the total power gives:

   .. figure:: https://services.fandom.com/mathoid-facade/v1/media/math/render/svg/9e4c461c90a761b655ffef9ace493c1d294e7b39

      :math:`E_{batt} = 158334J - 119083J = 39251J`

   That is, for a single solar panel with a constant unobstructed view of space, 
   you need **39.3 kJ of energy storage** to store enough energy to supply a 
   constant 264 W throughout the cycle. Accounting for battery runoff, this is 
   very close to the storage provided by two `Smart Batteries`_, or (less optimally) 
   one `Jumbo Battery`_.


How many batteries do I need?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


   -  In the `Spaced Out DLC`_, most asteroids do not experience meteor showers. 
      Therefore, solar panels can achieve an unobstructed view of space 100% of 
      the time. In this case, two `Smart Batteries`_ or one `Jumbo Battery`_ per 
      solar panel should be approximately sufficient to provide a constant supply 
      of power, even throughout the night.

   -  In the **base game**, an unlucky meteor shower can block off access to space 
      for an entire cycle or more. To account for a worst-case scenario (i.e. 
      having to store an entire cycle's worth of solar power), you will need a 
      storage capacity of at least 158 kJ per solar panel. Accounting for battery 
      runoff, this is equivalent to 9 `Smart Batteries`_ or 5 `Jumbo Batteries`_.

   -  In both cases, these calculations assume an *unobstructed view of space*. 
      In cases where solar panels are partially blocked (for example if vertically 
      overlapping solar panels to maximize efficiency) you may need greater or 
      fewer batteries to compensate, depending on the level of obstruction.


Tips
~~~~


   -  Solar Panels can convert `Shine Bugs`_ light into electricity as well, 
      although this only gives about 8-10W per Shine Bug, and only when they 
      are very close to the Solar Panel. This can be used for `Shine Bug Reactors`_.

   -  Because sunlight isn't constant, a optimal solar panel placed in the sun 
      over the course of one cycle will generate ~264W on average.

   -  In the `Spaced Out DLC`_, Solar Panels can be used for easy, free power 
      due to the DLC's lack of Meteors on most planetoids, once the according 
      material science is done. However, the player must also take into account 
      the max lux level for each planetoid in Spaced Out, as Lux level varies 
      from planetoid to planetoid. Also, the Regolith Planetoid has meteor showers, 
      that can stop solar panels from functioning. Many of the DLC's POI have 
      deconstructable `Window Tiles`_ to easily get the required Glass for 
      construction. The Orbital Cargo Module can be used to transport 600 kg of 
      Glass to a Planetoid without a Rocket Platform, allowing a new colony to 
      build 3 solar panels right off the bat.

   -  Solar Panels cannot get tune ups from the Power Control Station.

      汽轮机的关键机构是透平机（turbine）它负责将高温高压蒸汽的热能转换为机械能。蒸汽进入汽轮机后，
      沿轴向流过一级级的叶片，推动叶轮转动做功发电。蒸汽流经动叶片时，速度、压力、温度下降，将流体中
      的能量传递给叶轮，每一级动叶片后面是一级静叶片，静叶片入口截面小，出口截面大，其作用是使蒸汽在
      其中膨胀，提高蒸汽流速，为蒸汽进入下一级动叶片做功作准备。随着蒸汽不断膨胀做功，其压力不断下降，
      体积不断增加，因此越到后面，蒸汽所需的流通面积就越大，叶片也就越长。根据工作特点的不同汽轮机一般
      设置高压缸、中压缸和低压缸。高压缸在主蒸汽进入气缸的最初阶段时的蒸汽压力大，温度高，所以相对应
      的高压缸叶片短，叶轮直径大。汽轮机原理动画演示参考： https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ET4y1j76H/

   **Steam Turbine** is the primary device in harvesting `Power`_ from Heat, 
   usually `magma`_ or `Aquatuners`_, and can do it exceptionally well provided 
   you can keep the temperature of the `Steam`_ passing the turbine high.

   Steam Turbines are also an incredibly effective heat deletion device capable
   of removing significant amounts of heat from the environment and turning the 
   heat into power instead; this makes the Steam Turbine useful in many cooling 
   devices.

   It requires a `Duplicant`_ with Electrical Engineering `skill`_ to build.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The `steam`_ below the generator must be at least 125 °C. If the steam below 
   the generator becomes less than 125 °C the Steam Turbine will cease to produce 
   any power.

   Additionally, the steam turbine itself must be kept below 100 °C. If its 
   temperature gets higher than 100 °C, the warning message "Turbine too hot" 
   will appear, and the turbine will cease to operate.

   Ice stored within the steam turbine will be used to cool the turbine. When 
   the ice melts into water, that water is output through the same port as used 
   steam.

Mechanics
'''''''''

   To use the generator it must have hot `steam`_ below its base, a `water`_ 
   output and a `power`_ connection. Note: not all of the inlets need to be 
   uncovered for full functionality (see below).

   While active, every non-blocked inlet will use 0.4 kg of Steam (for a max of 
   2 kg with 5 inlets) per second. It outputs Water with the same mass as input 
   Steam at a fixed temperature of 95 °C.

      :math:`\frac{\left( \frac{85}{21} \right)}{4.179} = 0.969\frac{W}{kDTU/s}`

   :math:`P` is the produced power in W, :math:`\overset{˙}{m}` is the mass flow 
   rate in kg/s and :math:`T_{steam}` is the temperature of the steam in Celsius.

   The power output depends on the consumption rate and the temperature of the 
   steam. Assuming max steam consumption rate (2 kg/s), power output is 242 
   watts at 125 °C, capped at 850 watts at 200 °C or higher.

   With a lower flow rate, a higher temperature is required for the same heat 
   deletion and power production in accordance with the following table:

   +--------+-----------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+

   **Note for 1 inlet:** A steam turbine can absorb 0.08 kg steam in each tick 
   (0.2 second) from each inlet. But a steam turbine needs more than 0.1 kg Steam 
   to start conversion. As a result, when only one inlet is unblocked, the Turbine 
   works only one tick every two ticks. So the average power generation is limited 
   to 425 W, not 850 W. Therefore, the required temperature difference for max 
   power is also reduced by half.

   This does not affect the heat deletion and production. They still delete the 
   heat of 0.4 kg Steam per second, and in turn, produce 10% of that + 4 kDTU 
   themselves.

   Thus, to summarize this section:

   -  If the Steam is below 200 °C, have as many inputs unblocked as possible 
      to maximize power generation through having the Turbine suck in as much 
      as steam as possible.

   -  If the Steam is above 200 °C, block the inputs to just two to maximize 
      power generation while minimizing steam consumption and heat generation 
      of the Turbine.

   temperature above 125 °C) it will reduce the input steam in temperature to 95 °C 
   Water. How much heat is deleted :math:`q_{removed}` in kDTU/s depends on the 
   Specific Heat Capacity of Water (4.179(DTU/g)/°C), the flow rate :math:`\overset{˙}{m}` 
   in kg/s, and the steam's temperature :math:`T_{steam}` in Celsius.

Usage
~~~~~

Self-Cooled Steam Turbine
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

   A Steam Turbine can be used to cool itself using its own 95 °C exhaust water 
   to maintain a temperature of less than 100 °C, this requires limiting the 
   steam temperature to around 135 °C and power output to around 330 watts. 
   Maximizing the heat transfer between the exhaust water and the Steam Turbine 
   involves snaking radiant pipes behind the Steam Turbine. This works for any 
   material radiant pipe (even lead) if the atmosphere is more than 500 g `Hydrogen`_. 
   Copper/Gold radiant pipes even manage to cool the turbine in an +1500g `Oxygen`_ 
   atmosphere. This can be made yet more effective by adding in one or more liquid layers.

   A self cooling Steam Turbine produces the most power per unit heat deleted 
   of all setups, and they can be very attractive due to not needing an Aquatuner 
   and the associated plumbing, circuit and automation, while being able to cool 
   up to 292.53 kDTU/s without problems. The drawback to this is that, with their 
   limited steam temperature, you will require more of them to match the heat 
   deletion or power production of comparable ATST setups, and so they are best 
   used when space and materials are less important than efficiency.

Maximum Steam Temperature for sustainable self-cooling
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   There is only limited cooling potential in the exhaust water: raising the 
   temperature of 2000 g/s of water from 95 °C to 100 °C requires 41.79 kDTU/s, 
   substituting this into the equation \*Heat produced by turbine\* and solving 
   for steam temperature results in a value of 140.2 °C, this is where the heat 
   produced by the Turbine exactly equals the available cooling in the water. 
   The Steam Turbine would generate 365 watts.

   While theoretically a self-cooled Steam Turbine could run on 140 °C steam 
   this is an unstable equilibrium, if the Turbine gets too hot the flow of 
   exhaust water halts and it is unable to cool itself, typically stalling until 
   the player intervenes. Furthermore heat exchange between the exhaust water 
   and Steam Turbine is imperfect and there may be heat bleed between the Steam 
   chamber and the Steam Turbine. Due to these factors a practical self-cooled 
   Steam Turbine typically runs on steam temperatures not exceeding 135 °C and 
   generates around 330 watts.

Variable number of inlets at high temperatures
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   To remove as much heat as possible, the steam turbine should not be obstructed, 
   but for power efficiency, as much Heat (kDTU) should be turned into usable 
   Energy (J), or rather, no Heat should be wasted.

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/7/7f/Steam_turbine_power_optimization.png

   When the temperature of the steam rises too high multiple ports can be automatically blocked by doors one at a time. Above 200 °C the first door closes, above 226.25 °C the second, and above 270 °C the third. The fourth door however should not close at 357.5 °C, but rather at 444 °C.

   The temperature at which two inlets have the 850 W cap is 357.5 °C, any hotter 
   and all DTU above is wasted, a gradual increase.

   Taking only one inlet immediately cuts the used DTU's in half, but for every 
   degree the steam gets hotter it also only wastes half of the DTU until it hits 
   620 °C where it has its own cap of 425 W.

   .. table:: To gain 850 W, only 877.59 kDTU are needed (With two inlets this 
      is at 357,5 °C), everything in excess is wasted. And half of the DTU deleted 
      with one inlet are wasted, therefore we get following table:

      +-------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+
      | Temperature | 1 Inlet      |                |             | 2 Inlets     |                |             |
      +-------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+--------------+----------------+-------------+

   At 200°C two steam turbines can delete 1,755,180 DTU/s, and three `Thermo Aquatuners`_ 
   using `Water`_ or `Polluted Water`_ as coolant produce 1,755,180 DTU/s. This

Trivia
~~~~~~

Reintroducing exhaust water
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   Will cooling the steam with output water give less energy? No, steam turbines 
   yield their power proportional to the amount of heat they delete.

   Experiment:

   -  First, let's assume we have 10 kg Steam at 200 °C, for 5 seconds it will 
      provide 850 W → a total of 8,358 MDTU deleted for 4250 J.

   -  Then, let's assume the same 10 kg of Steam at 200 °C but add the 95 °C 
      Water back in instantaneously and lets assume the Steam Turbine could 
      suck up water 95 °C hot. For the first second we get 850 W. The second 
      second the steam will be 179 °C for 680 W, the third second 162.2°C for 
      544 W. On an infinite timescale the water will have reached 95 °C a total 
      of 8,358 MDTU deleted for 4250 J.

   Of course a steam turbine will stop at 125 °C, but the heat will remain to be 
   harnessed later.

   As a matter of fact the opposite holds true since the more important limit 
   is the 200 °C maximum temperature, or rather the 850 W power cap. If we run 
   the same thought experiment as before, 10 kg of Steam at 300 °C will still 
   run for 5 seconds at 850 W and produce 4250 J of energy... however, the 
   cooled Steam can run for 9 seconds at ever decreasing power (see table below), 
   producing about 5684.69 J while doing so.

Steam from multiple rooms
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

   .. figure:: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/oxygennotincluded_gamepedia_en/images/f/f4/Steam_turbine_multiple_rooms.png

   For the steam turbine to function only 1 port requires 125 °C. Therefore it 
   is possible to create setup where a steam turbine accepts steam from 2 steam 
   rooms where the temperature of one steam room is at 100 °C and the other 
   above 125 °C. This effectively allows you to cool a room to 100 °C.

Cool and Hot Steam Vents
''''''''''''''''''''''''

   This means with one steam room above 125 °C, the steam from a `Cool Steam Vent`_ 
   can be sucked up.

   It also means, it can take in steam that is much hotter. One port above 500 °C 
   Steam (0.4 kg/s) from a `Steam Vent`_ on one side, and three ports above 135 °C 
   Steam (1.2 kg/s) are effectively 1.6 kg/s of 226.25 °C Steam and produce 850 W.

Other tips
~~~~~~~~~~

   -  Like most generators it will continue to run, consuming its power source, 
      unless turned off manually or by an `automation`_ connection.

      -  It can often be useful to allow the Steam Turbine to simply waste 
         excess power, if it is primarily being used to delete heat.

   -  Steam Turbines cannot add to the packets from their output port, so each 
      one should have a dedicated uncloggable pipe segment.

   -  A metal refinery with a coolant of petroleum, crude oil, or super coolant 
      combined with a steam turbine actually generates excess power when refining 
      iron or steel due to the large amounts of heat generated by the refinery. 
      This is further improved with the operating duplicant's `Machinery`_ attribute, 
      since the refinery draws its 1200 W of power for less than the full 40 s/batch.

   -  An Aquatuner cooling Super Coolant will run energy neutral when combined 
      with a steam turbine that has engie's tune-up. Even better, a single 
      aquatuner/turbine setup with all 5 input ports open will not reach thermal 
      equilibrium until ~236 °C steam temperature, meaning the setup requires no 
      automation. With dupe's time for engie's tune-up and buffered by a power grid, 
      this setup can provide energy-free cooling. Care must be taken not to deplete 
      the heat in the cooling target, otherwise the setup will start drawing power.

   -  Steam Turbines exchange heat with their foundation tiles, and as such can be 
      cooled with a `heat-conductive foundation tile`_ that's not in contact with 
      Steam. Considering how high those tiles' `Thermal Conductivity`_ is, one 
      tile can be enough to cool a Turbine when using active cooling.

History
~~~~~~~

   -  `OC-252151`_: Introduced.
   -  `OC-252656`_: Steam turbine now works on a pressure differential and no longer requires water cooling.
   -  `QLM3-326232`_: Steam turbine reworked.
   -  `RP-379337`_: Steam turbines correctly obtain boost from Engie's Tune-up.
   -  `U47-561558`_: Steam Turbine shows obstructed tiles for steam intake before placing it.

   **Bottle Emptier** is a `building`_ used for emptying bottles of liquid into specific locations.


Usage
~~~~~

   清瓶器是需要复制人手动操作的设备，它还是制造利用游戏机制的“水门”利器，因为“一格一物”机制，
   沙门制造的水滴可以占据一格空间，即使液滴的量很小，但它也是需要占据一格空间的元素，因此可以
   避免气体、或者小动物进入到“水门”（Liquid Airlock）所控制的关键位置。同时还可以为区域提供
   开放空间而不是封闭的房间。 https://oxygennotincluded.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide/Liquid_Airlock

   The Bottle Emptier empties any bottle of liquid brought to it by a `Duplicant`_. 
   This is useful for cleaning up any mopped up spills. The type of liquid(s) it 
   empties can be limited by the player with the Element Filter menu of the Emptier.

   The Bottle Emptier can be rotated in construction so that the liquid can fall 
   to its left side or right side.

   By default the only option in the Element Filter menu is `Water`_, other `liquids`_ 
   become available as the player discovers them.

   If a duplicant empties a bottle of germ filled polluted water, both the surface 
   of the bottle emptier and the duplicant will be covered in germs.

   Enabling Auto Bottling option allows the Duplicants to specifically bottle liquid 
   at a `Pitcher Pump`_ and bring it to the Bottle Emptier, provided there is a 
   Pitcher Pump with liquid it accepts.

   The Bottle Emptier can empty a bottle of 200 kg liquid at most at one time. 
   Duplicants will not deliver another bottle until the current one is all discharged.

   The Bottle Emptier can be completely submerged and still function without issue.

   **Ore Scrubber** is a `Utility`_ Building that uses `Chlorine`_ to kill `Germs`_ 
   on items. Chlorine used by the Ore Scrubber is consumed.

   Despite its name, it apparently cleans everything, not just ore.

Tips
~~~~

   -  Ore Scrubbers are used to remove germs from items carried directly by Duplicants, 
      such as `Polluted Dirt`_ from an `Outhouse`_ or a `Water Sieve`_ handling germy water, 
      or `Slimelung`_-contaminated `Slime`_. It will not remove germs spread to Duplicants 
      when picking up contaminated debris.

   -  It is worth putting two or more of these down next to each other as a `Duplicant`_ 
      will ignore an Ore Scrubber if it is already in use.

      -  Automation might help space out how many Duplicants pass by Ore Scrubbers, 
         but a guaranteed method to force scrubbing is to setup doors with very 
         limited permissions. The tradeoff is that disinfecting materials will take 
         significantly longer, since fewer Duplicants will be able to participate.

   -  Slime often starts with up to 900,000 germs of `Slimelung`_ per block, requiring 
      two passes through Ore Scrubbers to fully disinfect.

      -  If digging is set to a higher priority than storing, Duplicants will 
         dig out multiple blocks of Slime and then collect it all together, 
         which adds up the total germs to far higher levels than two Ore Scubbers 
         can handle. Setting storing higher than digging will help guarantee they 
         carry out Slime immediately after mining it.

   -  Ore Scrubbers also removes germs from bottled fluids if they are being carried 
      by a Duplicant. This can be used to remove `Food Poisoning`_ from clean `water`_ 
      after it's been sieved.

      -  Gases containing airborne germs can also be scrubbed if they are taken from a 
         `Canister Filler`_. This may be useful when dealing with `Zombie Spores`_ 
         infesting `Carbon Dioxide`_.

   -  Placing Ore Scrubbers within a Chlorine atmosphere allows the scrubbed material 
      to benefit from both the operation of the Ore Scrubber itself, as well as the 
      natural disinfection provided by being surrounded by Chlorine, which can considerably 
      increase its effectiveness at removing germs. This will also help to clean Duplicants 
      of germs spread to them from picking up contaminated debris.

History
~~~~~~~

   -  `OU-229531`_: Introduced.
   -  `AP-417040`_: **Ore Scrubber** no longer requires `chlorine`_ in its pipe to work, only 
      in its storage. It also shows a red status icon when it has insufficient mass in storage.

   **Liquid Tepidizer** warms bodies of `Liquid`_ to the limit of 85 °C. 
   It must be fully submerged in greater than 400kg liquid to work.

   It is able to kill `Food Poisoning`_ and `Slimelung`_ `germs`_ very quickly.

   **Contents**

   -  1 Usage
   -  2 Trivia
   -  3 Bugs
   -  4 History


Usage
~~~~~

   The Liquid Tepidizer heats at a rate of 4,064 kDTU per second. This heats a full 
   tile of `Water`_ (1,000 kg) at a rate of about one degree per second.

      4.179 (DTU/g)/°C * 1,000kg = 4,179 kDTU per 1 °C

   The Liquid Tepidizer can disinfect `Polluted Water`_ by heating it. However, this 
   procedure takes lots of energy. New germs introduced into a body of polluted water 
   will restart the infection.

   A Liquid Tepidizer produces ~4.2 kDTU/s per watt consumed. It is the most power-efficient 
   building and can be used as a core of a central heating system, `when it is necessary`_.

   Because a Liquid Tepidizer is only capable of heating liquids up to 85°C, they are 
   not meant to be used for `steam`_ creation.


Trivia
~~~~~~

   -  Since Liquid Tepidizer checks to see if it has reached its Target Temperature 
   by averaging the temperature of all liquids above 400kg on its four tiles, liquids 
   will be heated up slightly beyond the Target Temperature before it stops.


Bugs
~~~~

   -  When first built and pulsed on and off through automation it can heat liquid 
      well over the 85°C limit.

   -  The Target Temperature verification is not actually done on its four tiles, 
      but on all valid tiles in a rectangle centered on its middle left tile. A tile 
      is valid if it has line of sight from that middle left tile.

   -  After reloading the game, `both previous bugs`_ will create 4064kDTU/s below 125°C 
      and only 64kDTU/s above that temperature despite indicating it produces 4064kDTU/s. 
      This was a quick fix done to mitigate those 2 bugs.

   **Thermo Aquatuner** cools the liquid piped through it and absorbs the Heat itself.

   If the environment around the Thermo Aquatuner cannot absorb its heat, it will 
   quickly overheat. Due to its high heat output it is recommended to submerge it 
   in a liquid, as gasses cannot exchange temperatures with it fast enough when 
   the machine is working full time.

Use of `Steel`_ or `Thermium`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   Due to the massive amounts of heat that this device can take away and invest into 
   itself, the choices of materials for this device is very limited if `Overheating`_ 
   is to be avoided. In the early and mid-game, the most reliable material is `Steel`_. 
   In the late game, `Thermium`_ is the best choice.


Use of `Thermo Sensor`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   A `Thermo Sensor`_ is also very much recommended - indeed, *required* - for efficient 
   use and control of this device. Setting the sensor close or next to the Aquatuner 
   is wise; this can give a measure of both the temperature of the Aquatuner and the 
   fluids that it is immersed in. If the Aquatuner is made of `Steel`_ or `Thermium`_, 
   the heat transfer will be fast enough to reliably control the temperature of the 
   Aquatuner and the fluids that are soaking heat from it.


Mechanics
~~~~~~~~~


   The Thermo Aquatuner (as well as the `Thermo Regulator`_) works by taking heat 
   from anything piped into it and applying that heat to itself, and does not produce 
   its own heat. As this is heat-neutral, cooling it with its own output will cause 
   it to maintain its temperature, assuming no other heat sources or sinks are present.

   The amount of heat moved depends on the type and amount of liquid piped in. Each 
   packet of liquid has 14 °C removed from it, regardless of the Specific Heat Capacity 
   (SHC) of the fluid or the amount. It is therefore best to use liquids with a high 
   SHC (`Water`_, `Polluted Water`_, `Super Coolant`_) and to ensure all packets sent 
   in are 10 kg (it consumes 1.2 kJ per packet, not per 10 kg), in order to make the 
   most of the 1.2 kW power requirement.

   The Aquatuner does not respect freezing temperatures of liquids, and will damage 
   the output pipe if liquids are cooled below their freezing temperature.

   The Aquatuner is the only building capable of reliably producing liquid oxygen and 
   hydrogen, as it has no minimum output temperature. The Thermo Regulator also does 
   not have a minimum temperature, but there is no suitable gas to use for cooling hydrogen.

      +-------------------+------------+------------+------------+--------------------+-----------+--------------+

   Formula for Heat Moved (assuming 10kg packets of liquid) is Heat Moved = SHC × 14C × 10,000g. 
   For example, for Nuclear Waste, Heat Moved = 7.440 × 14 × 10,000 = 1,041,600 DTU/s.

   In addition to the Heat Moved, the Aquatuner itself will heat up and if it is not 
   sufficiently cooled down, it will overheat and take damage. The amount of self heat 
   will depend on the liquid used and the metal used to build the Aquatuner. The formula 
   for Self Heating = Heat Moved / (mass of Aquatuner × SHC of metal used / 5). 
   
   Note the mass of the Aquatuner is fixed at 1,200,000g and as a building it has its 
   thermal mass divided by 5. For example, the formula for Self Heating °C/s for a steel 
   Aquatuner using water: Self Heating = Heat Moved (585,060) / (Mass of Aquatuner (1,200,000) ×
   SHC of steel (0.49) / 5) = 585,060 / 117,600 = 4.975 °C/s.

   Any liquid can be used, but these are most common as they have desirable properties; 
   Super Coolant has the largest heat capacity. Thermal conductivity is listed above, 
   but has no effect on the operation of the Thermo Aquatuner; it is important only when 
   the coolant exchanges heat with the environment. Notably, buildings that dump heat 
   into a coolant piped into them, such as the `Metal Refinery`_, ignore thermal conductivity.

   Note: There is a lower temperature limit of -272.1 °C (1 K). Super Coolant is the 
   only liquid capable of reaching such a temperature without freezing. However, the 
   Thermo Aquatuner will continue to operate, consuming 1200 W and generating no heat 
   in the process.


Caution on the Use of `Thermium`_ and `Super Coolant`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   Both high-end manufactured materials vastly increases the Aquatuner's ability and 
   efficiency at exchanging heat - but also vastly changes the amounts of heat involved. 
   Using these materials require more careful control of not just the temperatures of 
   the Aquatuner and the fluids that it is immersed in, but also what the fluids and 
   Aquatuner is drawing heat from. It is very easy to excessively cool a region without 
   this additional care.


Use to melt metal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   If an Aquatuner is used to cool a full pipe of `Water`_ or `Polluted Water`_ continuously 
   while sitting in `Vacuum`_, it will melt before the damage from overheating breaks it. 
   It is recommended to disable auto-repair to avoid wasting metal. Note that since 
   buildings have 1/5 the Specific Heat Capacity of the material they are made of, the heat 
   in the resulting liquid metal will be 5 times what was displaced by the Aquatuner. This 
   trick is particularly useful to melt `Steel`_, since `Liquid Steel`_ is used for a wide 
   array of advanced industrial processes.


Tips
~~~~


   Despite the similar SHC, Polluted water should be picked over Water for the - 22 °C 
   freezing point, since maintenance on burst pipes tends to be very tricky, the low 
   freezing point provides much more wiggle room when trying to balance the coolant receiver.

   While Nuclear Waste can be used to move very large amounts of heat, care must be taken 
   as to not let it go below freezing point, and the pipe network doesn't stop. When stops,
   the nuclear waste becomes "contained" in the Aquatuner, which will make it leak from 
   the Aquatuner.

   七宗罪将罪行由重到浅分为傲慢、嫉妒、愤怒、懒惰、贪婪、暴食和淫欲。
   SIX 名字取自 THE SIXTH SIN，即 Gluttony (暴食)，游戏表现了 SIX 对于食物的渴望。
   MONO 的性格与 SIX 的性格在面对梦魇时态度完全相反，SIX 是不断逃避。

   游戏精心打造的细节都渲染出了游戏的终极恐惧 —— 死亡。正如上一作那样，如果你解不开谜题，
   或是在潜行环节中出错，你很可能就会被某个怪物抓住，然后遭受可怕的命运。

   银河历险记 3 是一款探险及谜题类游戏，由机械迷城 (Machinarium)和植物精灵 (Botanicula)的优秀
   创造者出品。它是 Amanita Design 目前为止最为不凡的体验，同时也可以说是热门独立游戏银河历险记
   和银河历险记 2 的续集。画面或相像风格和宫崎骏的《风之谷》比较相似。

   2003 年推出的初代《银河历险记》其实是 Jakub 的毕业设计项目。彼时就读于布拉格艺术、建筑和设计学院
   （Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design）的 Jakub “想创造一些可交互的项目”。因为技术
   不在行，他选择的载体是操作简单、上手容易，且盛行一时的Flash。

   除了音乐、音效是交给一位朋友操刀，Jakub 一手包办了其他开发内容。断断续续制作了一年多后，他将完成品
   免费发布在了一个朋友的网站上。没想到，最后涌入的玩家彻底挤爆了网站服务器， Jakub 这才意识到自己的
   游戏这么受欢迎。

   《这是我的战争》别称《我的这一战》，是 11 bit 工作室所制作的黑暗求生游戏，与一般的战争游戏不同，
   玩家控制的并不是士兵，而是一群在战火中求生存的平民，开发商给出的理念是让玩家从另一个角度去看待战争。

   战争是游戏常用的故事背景，因为它能为玩家提供最直接的游戏目标：杀死敌人获胜。但历史告诉我们，
   任何战争，最大的受害者永远是平民。而市面上无数的军事游戏，几乎没有一款对这些无辜的平民的处境进行
   描绘，而本作将填补这一空白。

   玩家扮演平民，在战火连连的城市中生存。玩家得在城市废墟中寻找食物、武器、零件等任何可以利用的物品。
   当然，大部分城市废墟也有其他的幸存者，幸存者有友善的，有邪恶的。有些幸存者完全不把玩家放在眼里的，
   玩家可以选择帮助或者无视那些幸存者，同那些幸存者交易物资，玩家也可以杀死那些幸存者掠夺他们的资源，
   唯一限制玩家的只有自己心中的道德约束。

   三十年前，二十世纪最惨烈，最无人性的围城战在萨拉热窝爆发。当时的萨拉热窝人，如何在战争中艰难求生；
   围城战中，留下了哪些感人的故事；这场战争，又带给了他们什么？

   萨拉热窝围城战役是波斯尼亚战争的一部分，是现代战争史上最长的围城战役。波斯尼亚与黑塞哥维那首都
   萨拉热窝从1992年4月5日至1996年2月29日遭到南斯拉夫人民军与塞族共和国军围困，共计 1,425 天。
   萨拉热窝围城战役时间超过斯大林格勒战役三倍，比列宁格勒围城战还要长一年之久。

   在围城战期间，塞族武装发动多次进攻，占领了萨拉热窝外围郊区，旋即在这片地区展开种族清洗。 而保卫
   萨拉热窝的波黑军队只有 3 万人，而且极度缺乏重武器，只有约 20 门大炮和几辆坦克，以及一些防控和
   反坦克导弹。



🌟战鼓啪嗒砰（PATAPON）

   Patapon3 Overhaul 更新预览 https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv12335671

   《PATAPON》的横空出世，颠覆了当时所有音游玩家的概念。这严格意义上可以说是一款“节奏游戏”，但远不止于
   节奏元素，在此基础上还融合了收集、策略、动作、养成的玩法。用原始部落文明的世界观，将这些元素完美的
   结合在了一起。

   一个古老的种族在对抗怪兽的战争中失败了，战士们死的死伤的伤，他们居住的故乡在战斗中化为灰烬，生还者
   为了重建自己的家园，赶走怪兽和敌人，而走上了召集同伴的艰苦道路。玩家扮演的神明大人与举着自己种族
   标志大旗的号召者相互配合，在废墟中找到受伤的伙伴，逃避大龙的追击，赶走敌人的余党回到村子里面，
   他们建立新的村庄，用自己的智慧召唤出新的伙伴，神枪、弓手和盾兵等，伙伴们为了共同的目标，齐心合力
   赶走敌人重建家园。

   《PATAPON》特别适合推荐给那些对节奏感很有自信的人，游戏让玩家控制部队下达的每一个命令，都离不开节奏
   的运用。圈方角叉四个按键对应四种声音，通过这四个声音的不同组合就可以为部队下达前进、攻击、警戒、后退、
   蓄力、祈祷五个命令。这些命令只要用上两次，就会深刻的印在玩家的脑子中，相信玩过的所有玩家在十多年后，
   依然会记得那句“啪塔啪塔啪塔砰”。 

   《PATAPON》是音乐游戏，也是角色扮演游戏。玩家除了进行推进流程的每一场战斗之外，还需要去收集素材来
   升级装备和兵种，“战斗-刷素材-升级兵种/装备”的思路，正是同时期在 PSP 上大火的《怪物猎人 携带版》
   等一系列共斗游戏中配备的玩法。喜闻乐见的玩法加上音游的元素，在制作人小谷浩之神来之笔的创意下结合
   的淋漓尽致。更别说那大胆而又创新的 2D 剪影的美术风格，《PATAPON》在每一个地方都做到了让玩家眼前
   一亮后拍手叫绝的程度。如此的成功，让游戏在后续推出了二代和三代，每一代都为《PATAPON》起到了强化
   的作用甚至是变革的作用。

   天美工作室实习员工开发的《曲中剑》也有类似的玩法，不过此手游重心在于音乐，音游结合国风武侠元素。
