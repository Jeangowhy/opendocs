THANKS
------

   Many people have contributed in a variety of ways in the preparation of this book.
   At Cambridge University Press I would like to thank Alison Sharpe, Barbara Thomas and
   Geraldine Mark, all of whom have brought their professionalism and expertise to guiding and
   shaping the book in its various stages. My special thanks are due to Jeanne McCarten, not only
   for comments on early drafts, but for her constant support and encouragement.

   Thanks also to Peter Ducker for the design, and to Peter Elliot and Amanda MacPhail for the
   illustrations.

   For providing a stimulating working environment, I would like to thank former colleagues at
   the Learning Assistance Centre, University of Sydney, where the writing began in earnest, and
   present colleagues at the English for International Students Unit, the University of Birmingham,
   where the project was completed.

   Many of my students at the University of Birmingham have worked on versions of the material
   and I wish to thank in particular students on the Japanese Secondary School Teachers' course
   between 1995 and 1998 who carefully and constructively evaluated sections of the work. I would
   also like to thank the students and staff at the institutions all over the world where the material
   was piloted.

   Gerry Abbot, Annie Broadhead, David Crystal, Hugh Leburn, Laura Matthews, Michael
   McCarthy, Stuart Redman and Anna Sikorzynaska made extensive comments on the manuscript.
   I hope I have been able to reflect their many valuable suggestions in the finished book.

   At home, Ann, Suzanne and David have all had a part to play in giving me time to write the
   book, motivation, and examples.

.. _PVIII:

TO THE STUDENT
--------------

   **Who the book is for**

   The book is intended for more advanced students of English. It is written mainly as a self-study
   book, but might also be used in class with a teacher. It revises some of the more difficult points of
   grammar that you will have already studied - such as when to use the, a/an or no article, and
   when to use the past simple or the present perfect - but will also introduce you to many more
   features of English grammar appropriate to an advanced level of study.

   **How the book is organised**

   There are 120 units in the book. Each one looks at a particular area of grammar. Some sections
   within each unit focus on the use of a grammatical pattern, such as will be + -ing (as in will be
   travelling). Others explore grammatical contrasts, such as whether to use would or used to to
   report past events, or when we use because or because of. The 120 units are grouped under a
   number of headings such as Tenses and Modals. You can find details of this in the `Contents` on
   pp. iii-vi.

   Each unit consists of two pages. On the left-hand page are explanations and examples; on the
   right are practice exercises. The letters next to each exercise show you which sections of the 
   left-hand page you need to understand to do that exercise. You can check your answers in the `Key` on
   page 289. The Key also comments on some of the answers. Four `Appendices` tell you about
   passive verb form, quotation, irregular verbs and `Typical Errors` (see below). To help you find the
   information you need there is an Index at the back of the book. Although terms to describe
   grammar have been kept to a minimum some have been included, and you can find explanations
   of these terms in the Glossary on page 265.

   On each left-hand page you will find a number of ⇗ symbols. These are included to show the
   kinds of mistakes that students often make concerning the grammar point being explained. These
   `Typical Errors` are given in Appendix 4 on page 246, together with a correction of the error, and
   an explanation where it is helpful.

   The symbol ↺ is used to show you when it might be useful to consult a dictionary. On the
   explanation pages it is placed next to lists of words that follow a particular grammatical pattern,
   and on the exercise pages it is used, for example, to show where it necessary to understand what
   particular words mean in order to do the exercise. Good English-English dictionaries include the
   Cambridge International Dictionary of English, the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary
   English, the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, and the Collins Cobuild English Language
   Dictionary.

   **How to use the book**

   It is not necessary to work through the units in order. If you know what grammar points you have
   difficulty with, go straight to the units that deal with them. You can use the `Index` to help you find
   the relevant unit or units. If you are unsure which units to study, use the `Study Guide` on page 280.
   You can use the units in a number of ways. You might study the explanation and examples
   first, do the exercises on the opposite page, check your answers in the key, and then look again at
   the explanations if you made any mistakes. If you just want to revise a grammar point you think
   you already know, you could do the exercises first and then study the explanations for any you
   got wrong. You might of course simply use the book as a reference book without doing the
   exercises.

   A number of `Additional` Exercises are included for further practice of particular areas
   of grammar.

.. _Pix:

TO THE TEACHER
--------------

   `Advanced Grammar in Use` was written as a self-study grammar book but teachers might also
   find it useful for supplementing or supporting their classroom teaching.

   The book will probably be most useful for more advanced level students for reference and
   practice. Students at these levels will have covered many of the grammar points before, and some
   of the explanations and practice exercises will provide revision material. However, all units are
   likely to contain information that is new for students even at advanced level, and many of the uses
   of particular grammatical patterns and contrasts between different forms will not have been
   studied before.

   No attempt has been made to grade the units according to level of difficulty. Instead you
   should select units as they are relevant to the syllabus that you are following with your students,
   or as particular difficulties arise.

   There are many ways in which you might use the book with a class. You might, for example,
   use explanations and exercises on the left-hand pages as sources of ideas on which you can base
   the presentation of grammar patterns and contrasts, and use the exercises for classroom practice
   or set them as consolidation material for self-study. The left-hand pages can then be a resource
   for future reference and revision by students. You might alternatively want to begin with the
   exercises and refer to the left-hand page only when students are having problems. You could also
   set particular units or groups of units (such as those on Articles or The future) for self-study if
   individual students are having difficulties.

   The Typical Errors in each unit (indicated with a ⇗ symbol and listed in Appendix 4 on page 246) 
   can be discussed with students either before the explanations and examples have been studied, 
   in order to focus attention on the problem to be looked at in that part of the unit, or after
   they have been studied, as consolidation. For example, before studying a particular unit you
   could write the typical error(s) for that unit on the board and ask students: "What's wrong and
   how would you correct it?"

   There is a set of `Additional Exercises` (page 269), most of which can be used to provide practice
   of grammar points from a number of different units.

   A 'classroom edition' of `Advanced Grammar in Use` is also available. It has no key and some
   teachers might prefer to use it with their students.

Present simple (I do) and present continuous (I am doing) (1)
-------------------------------------------------------------

   A

   We use the present simple to describe things that are always true, or situations that exist now and,
   as far as we know, will go on indefinitely:

   - • It takes me five minutes to get to school.
   - • Trees grow more quickly in summer than in winter. 
   - • Liz plays the violin brilliantly.

   To talk about particular actions or events that have begun but have not ended at the time of
   speaking, we use the present continuous:

   - • The car isn't starting again.
   - • 'Who are you phoning?' 'I'm trying to get through to Joan.'
   - • The shop is so inefficient that many customers are taking their business elsewhere.

   We often use time expressions such as at the moment, at present, currently, just, and still to
   emphasise that the action or event is happening now:

   - • 'Have you done the shopping?' Tm just going.'

   Notice that the action or event may not be going on at the time of speaking:

   - • The police are talking to a number of people about the robbery.

   We use the present simple to talk about habits or things that happen on a regular basis:

   - • I leave work at 5.30 most days.
   - • Each July we go to Turkey for a holiday.

   However, when we describe repeated actions or events that are happening at or around the time
   of speaking, we use the present continuous:

   - • Why are you jumping up and down?
   - • I'm hearing a lot of good reports about your work these days.

   We can use the present continuous or the present simple to describe something that we regularly
   do at a particular time. Compare:

   - • We usually watch the news on TV at 9.00. (= we start watching at 9.00)
   - • We're usually watching the news on TV at 9.00. (= we're already watching at 9.00)

   We use the present continuous to imply that a situation is or may be temporary. Compare:

   - • Banks lend money to make a profit, (this is what usually happens)
   - • Banks are lending more money (these days) to encourage businesses to expand, (implies a

   temporary arrangement)

   - • She teaches Maths in a school in Bonn, (a permanent arrangement)
   - • She's teaching Maths in a school in Bonn, (implies that this is not, or may not be, permanent)

   We often use the present simple with verbs that perform the action they describe:

   - • I admit I can't see as well as I used to. (= an admission)
   - • I refuse to believe that he didn't know the car was stolen. (= a refusal)

   Other verbs like this (sometimes called performative verbs) include accept, acknowledge, advise,
   apologise, assume, deny, guarantee, hope, inform, predict, promise, recommend, suggest,
   suppose, warn.
   We can use modals with performative verbs to make what we say more tentative or polite:.

   - • I would advise you to arrive two hours before the flight leaves.
   - • I'm afraid I have to inform you that your application for funding has been turned down.

   We often prefer to use the present simple rather than the present continuous with verbs describing
   states:

   - • I really enjoy travelling.
   - • The group currently consists of five people, but we hope to get more members soon.

   Г Other common state verbs include agree, assume, believe, belong to, contain, cost, disagree, feel,
   hate, have, hope, know, like, look, love, own, prefer, realise, regret, resemble, smell, taste.
   However, we can use the present continuous with some state verbs when we want to emphasise
   that a situation is temporary, for a period of time around the present. Compare:

   - • I consider him to be extremely fortunate. (This is my view) and
   - • I'm considering taking early retirement. (This is something I'm thinking about now)
   - • The children love having Jean stay with us. (They love it when Jean stays) and
   - • The children are loving having Jean stay with us. (Jean is staying with us now)

   With some verbs used to describe a temporary state (e.g. ache, feel, hurt, look (= seem)), there is
   little difference in meaning when we use the present simple and present continuous:

   - • What's the matter with Bill? He looks / is looking awful.

   When have has a non-state meaning - for example when it means 'eat', 'undergo', 'take' or
   'hold' - we can use the present continuous:

   - • 'What's that terrible noise?' 'The neighbours are having a party.'

   eWe use the present continuous when we talk about changes, developments, and trends:

   - • • The growing number of visitors is damaging the footpaths.
   - • I'm beginning to realise how difficult it is to be a teacher.

   When we tell a story or joke we often describe the main events using the present (or past) simple
   and longer, background events using the present (or past) continuous:

   - • She goes (or went) up to this man and looks (or looked) straight into his eyes. She's carrying

   (or was carrying) a bag full of shopping...
   We can also use the present simple and present continuous like this in
   commentaries (for example, on sports events) and in giving instructions:

   - • King serves to the left hand court and Adams makes a wonderful

   return. She's playing magnificent tennis in this match...

   - • You hold the can in one hand. Right, you're holding it in one hand;

   now you take off the lid with the other.
   When we want to emphasise that something is done repeatedly, we can use the present continuous
   with words like always, constantly, continually, or forever. Often we do this when we want to
   show that we are unhappy about it, including our own behaviour:

   - • They're constantly having parties until the early hours of the morning.

   We use the past continuous (see Unit 6) in the same way:

   - • He was forever including me in his crazy schemes.

   The present simple is used to report what we have heard or what we have read:

   - • This newspaper article explains why unemployment has been rising so quickly.

   We also use the present simple in spoken English in phrases such as I gather, I hear, I see, and I
   understand to introduce news that we have heard, read or seen (e.g. on television):

   - • I gather you're worried about the new job?
   - • The Prince is coming to visit, and I hear he's very rich.

   Present perfect
   When we talk about something that happened in the past, but we don't specify precisely when it
   happened (perhaps we don't know, or it is not important to say when it happened), we use the
   present perfect (but see E below):

   - • A French yachtsman has broken the record for sailing round the world single-handed.
   - • I have complained about the traffic before.

   When we use the present perfect, it suggests some kind of connection between what happened in
   the past, and the present time. Often we are interested in the way that something that happened in
   the past affects the situation that exists now:

   - • I've washed my hands so that I can help you with the cooking.
   - • We can't go ahead with the meeting, because very few people have shown any interest.

   The connection with the present may also be that something happened recently, with a
   consequence for the present:

   - • I've found the letter you were looking for. Here it is.
   - • My ceiling has fallen in and the kitchen is flooded. Come quickly!

   When we talk about how long an existing situation has lasted, even if we don't give a precise
   length of time, we use the present perfect (but see F below):

   - • They've grown such a lot since we last saw them.
   - • Prices have fallen sharply over the past six months.
   - • We've recently started to walk to work instead of taking the bus.

   We often use the present perfect to say that an action or event has been repeated a number of
   times up to now (see also Unit 4B):

   - • They've been to Chile three times. • I've often wished I'd learned to read music.

   Past simple
   When we want to indicate that something happened at a specific time in the past, we use the past
   simple. We can either say when it happened, using a time adverb, or assume that the hearer
   already knows when it happened or can understand this from the context:

   - • She arrived at Kennedy Airport at 2 o'clock this morning.
   - • Jane left just a few minutes ago.
   - • Jim decided to continue the course, even though it was proving very difficult.

   We use the past simple for situations that existed for a period of time in the past, but not now:

   - • When I was younger I played badminton for my local team.
   - • The Pharaohs ruled Egypt for thousands of years.

   If we are interested in when a present situation began rather than how long it has been going on
   for, we use the past simple. Compare:

   - • I started to get the pains three weeks ago. • I've had the pains for three weeks now.

   a • When did you arrive in Britain? • How long have you been in Britain?

   - •However, we also use the past simple to talk about how long something went on for if the action

   or event is no longer going on (see also Unit 4C):

   - • I stayed with my grandparents for six months. (= I am no longer staying there)
   - • 'He spent some time in Paris when he was younger.' 'How long did he live there?'

   We use the present perfect when we talk about something that happened in a period of time up to
   the present. We use the past simple to talk about something that happened at a particular, finished
   time in the past. Compare:

   - • Science has made many major advances this century, and
   - • Scientists made some fundamental discoveries in the 18th century.
   - • He puts to good use things that other people have thrown away, and
   - • I threw away most of my old books when I moved house.

   When we report that someone has recently invented, produced, discovered or written something
   we use the present perfect. When we talk about something that was invented, etc. in the more
   distant past we use the past simple. Compare:

   - • Scientist have discovered that, all over the world, millions of frogs and toads are dying.
   - • It is often said that Hernan Cortes 'discovered' Mexico in 1519.
   - • Two schoolchildren have invented a device for moving large objects up flights of stairs.
   - • Chinese craftsmen invented both paper and printing.

   Sometimes it makes very little difference to the main sense of the sentence if we think of something
   happening in a period of time up to the present or at a particular, finished time in the past:

   - • The research is now complete and the experiment was {or has been) a success.
   - • Does it concern you that you failed {or have failed) the test?
   - • I'm sure I read {or I have read) somewhere that he died in a plane crash.

   We can use either the present perfect or the past simple to talk about repeated actions or events. If
   we use the present perfect, we often suggest that the action or event might happen again.
   Sometimes we emphasise this with phrases such as so far and up to now (see Unit 5). If we use the
   past simple, it suggests that it is finished and won't happen again. Compare:

   - • Timson has made 13 films and I think her latest is the best, and
   - • Timson made 13 films before she was tragically killed in a car accident.
   - • Lee has represented his country on many occasions, and hopes to go on to compete in the

   next Olympics, and

   - • Lee represented his country on many occasions, but was forced to retire after an injury.

   We can use both the present perfect and the past simple to talk about states. We use the present
   perfect to talk about a state that existed in the past and still exists now, and we use the past simple
   if the state no longer exists. Compare:

   - • I have known him most of my working life. (I am still working) and
   - • I knew him when we were both working in Rome.
   - • We have belonged to the tennis club since we moved here. (We still belong to it.) and
   - • We belonged to the tennis club in the village we used to live in.

   In news reports, you will often read or hear events introduced with the present perfect, and then
   the past simple is used to give the details:
   The film star Jim Cooper has died of
   cancer. He was 68 and lived in Texas...'

   returned safely to earth. It landed

   ever since. It's the best thing the council (13) did

   scheme (14) has led to proposals for similar
   schemes in other cities.

   Some time adverbs that connect the past to the present are often used with the present perfect:

   - • Don't disturb Amy. She's just gone to sleep, (not ...she just went to sleep.)
   - • Have you seen Robert lately} (not Did you see...)

   Other time adverbs like this include already, since (last week), so far, still, up to now, yet.
   When we use time adverbs that talk about finished periods of time we use the past simple rather
   than the present perfect:

   - • Marie died, at the age of 86, in 1964. (not Marie has died...)

   Other time adverbs like this include (a month) ago, at (3 o'clock), last (week, month), on
   (Monday), once (= at some time in the past), then, yesterday.
   We often use before, for, and recently with the present perfect and also the past simple.
   For example:
   ...with present perfect

   - • Nothing like this has happened before.
   - • We've had the dishwasher for three years.

   (= we have still got it)

   - • A new school has recently opened in New Road.

   ...with past simple

   - • Why didn't you ask me before}
   - • We had the car for six years.

   (= we no longer have it)

   - • I saw Dave recently.

   Time adverbs that refer to the present, such as today, this morning/week/month, can also be used
   with either the present perfect or past simple. If we see today etc. as a past, completed period of
   time, then we use the past simple; if we see today, etc. as a period including the present moment,
   then we use the present perfect. Compare:

   - • I didn't shave today (= the usual time has passed; suggests I will not shave today) and
   - • I haven't shaved today. (= today is not finished; I may shave later or may not)
   - • I wrote three letters this morning. (= the morning is over) and
   - • I've written three letters this morning. (= it is still morning)

   We use since to talk about a period that started at some point in the past and continues until the
   present time. This is why we often use since with the present perfect:

   - • Since 1990 I have lived in a small house near the coast.
   - • Tom has been ill since Christmas.

   In a sentence which includes a smce-clause, the usual pattern is for the smce-clause to contain a
   past simple, and the main clause to contain a present perfect:

   - • Since Mr Hassan became president, both taxes and unemployment have increased.
   - • I haven't been able to play tennis since I broke my arm.

   However, we can use a present perfect in the swce-clause if the two situations described in the
   main and s/nce-clause extend until the present:

   - • Since I've lived here, I haven't seen my neighbours.

   We use the present perfect with ever and never to emphasise that we are talking about the whole
   of a period of time up until the present:

   - • It's one of the most magnificent views I have ever seen. (= in my whole life)
   - • I've never had any problems with my car. (= at any time since I bought it)

   We use the past simple with ever and never to talk about a completed period in the past:

   - • When he was young, he never bothered too much about his appearance.

   To talk about a temporary situation that existed at or around a particular time in the past, we use
   the past continuous:

   - • At the time of the robbery, they were staying with my parents.
   - • My head was aching again, so I went home.

   Compare the use of the past continuous and the past simple in these sentences:

   - • She was shaking with anger as she left the hotel.
   - • When he realised I was looking at him, he turned away.
   - • Erika dropped her bag while she was getting into her car.

   We often use the past simple to talk about a completed past event and the past continuous to
   describe the situation that existed at the time. The completed event might have interrupted the
   situation, or just occurred while the situation or event was in progress.
   We don't normally use the past continuous with certain verbs describing states (see Unit 2A):

   - • This house belonged to the King of Sweden, (not ...was belonging to...)

   D When we talk about two past actions or events that went on over
   the same period of time, we can often use the past continuous for both:

   - • Sally was reading to the children while Kevin was washing up.
   - • Mario was working in a restaurant when I was living in London.

   However, we can often use the past simple to express a similar meaning:

   - • Mario worked in a restaurant while he lived in London, (or ...was living in London.)

   When we talk about two or more past completed events that follow each other, we use the past
   simple for both. The first may have caused the second:

   - • She got up when the alarm clock went off.
   - • He jumped out of bed and ran to see who the parcel was for.

   When we talk about a permanent or long-term situation that existed in the past, we use the past
   simple rather than the past continuous:

   - • When I was a child I played the violin, (not ...I was playing...)

   However, if the situation was temporary, we can also use the past continuous. Compare:

   - • I was working in a car factory during the summer of 1976. (or I worked...) and
   - • He worked hard all his life, (not He was working...)

   We use the past simple rather than the past continuous when we are talking about repeated
   actions or events in the past:

   - • We visited Spain three times last year, (not We were visiting...)
   - • I went past her house every day. (not I was going...)
   - • She slept very badly whenever she stayed with her grandparents, (not ...was sleeping...)

   However, the past continuous can also be used when we want to emphasise that the repeated
   actions only went on for a limited and temporary period of past time (See also Unit 2C):

   - • When Carlo was in hospital, we were visiting him twice a day. (or ...we visited...)
   - • To get fit for the race, I was going to the sports centre every day. (or ...I went...)

   We use the past continuous when the repeated actions or events provide a longer background to
   something else that happened (see A):

   - • During the time I started to get chest pains, I was playing tennis a lot.

   P r e s e n t p e r f e c t c o n t i n u o u s ( I h a v e b e e n d o i n g )
   We use the present perfect continuous to talk about a situation or activity that started in the past
   and has been in progress for a period until now. Sometimes we use the present perfect continuous
   with expressions that indicate the time period (e.g. with since and for):

   - • I've been meaning to phone Jack since I heard he was back in the country.
   - • The competition has been running every year since 1980.
   - • She's been living in New Zealand for over a year now.
   - • People have been saying for ages that the building should be pulled down.

   Without such an expression, the present perfect continuous refers to a recent situation or activity
   and focuses on its present results:

   - • Look! It's been snowing.
   - • 'You're looking well.' 'I've been playing a lot of squash to lose weight.'
   - • 'Haven't seen anything of Rod for a while.' 'No, he's been working in Germany.'

   The situation or activity may still be going on, or it may just have stopped. Compare:

   - • We've been discussing the proposals for a number of years. (= still going on) and
   - • Your eyes are red - have you been crying? (= recently stopped)

   ' В ^
   е °ft en u s e t n e P r e s e n t perfect continuous when we ask questions with How long...? and when
   we say how long something has been in progress:

   - • How long have you been waiting for me?
   - • How long have they been living next door to you?
   - • For more than two years I've been trying to get permission to extend my house.
   - • Unemployment has been rising steadily since the huge increase in oil prices.

   We can use the present perfect continuous or a present tense (the present simple or the present
   continuous) when we talk about a situation or activity that started in the past and is still
   happening now or has just stopped. However, we use the present perfect continuous when we are
   talking about how long the action or event has been going on. Compare:

   - • I see Tom most weekends, and
   - • I've been seeing a lot of Tom since he moved into the flat upstairs, (not I see...)
   - • It's raining, and
   - • It's been raining heavily all night, (not It's raining...)

   For the difference between the present perfect and present perfect continuous in sentences like
   this, see Unit 8.
   When we talk about situations or actions that went on over a past period of time but finished at a
   particular point in time before now, we don't use the present perfect continuous:
   о • I was reading until midnight last night, (not I have been reading...)

   - • • She had been living in Spain before her family moved to Brazil, (not She has been living...)
   - • He put off the decision for as long as possible, but eventually he made up his mind and

   bought the car. (not He has been putting off...)
   We generally avoid the present perfect continuous with verbs that describe states (see Unjt 2A).

   - • The guests have been arriving since about

   6 o'clock.

   - • Since the operation two months ago, Joe

   has been learning to walk again. He can
   already take two or three steps unaided.

   - • She's been driving for 3 years now.
   - • Mark and Helena have arrived - they're in

   the sitting room.

   - • I have learnt a lot about painting from

   Paul.

   - • We have driven all the way here without a

   break.
   We use both the present perfect continuous and the present perfect to talk about something that
   started in the past and which affects the situation that exists now. The difference is that the
   present perfect continuous focuses on the activity or event which may or may not be finished. The
   present perfect, however, focuses on the effect of the activity or event, or the fact that something
   has been achieved.
   Sometimes the difference between them is simply one of emphasis (see also Unit 10B):

   - • I've been following their discussions with great interest, (emphasises the activity; that is, my

   following their discussions)

   - • I've followed their discussions with great interest, (emphasises the result; I may now react to

   what was said or decided)
   We can use either the present perfect continuous or the present perfect to talk about activities or
   events that are repeated again and again until now:

   - • Joseph has been kicking a football against the wall all afternoon, (or ...has kicked...)
   - • The press has been calling for her resignation for several weeks, (or ...has called...)

   However, if we mention the number of times the activity or event was repeated, we use the
   present perfect rather than the present perfect continuous:

   - • I've bumped into Susan 3 times this week.
   - • He has played for the national team in 65 matches so far.

   We use the present perfect rather than the present perfect continuous when we talk about long-
   lasting or permanent situations, or when we want to emphasise that we are talking about the
   whole of a period of time until the present (see also Unit 5D):

   - • I have always admired Chester's work.
   - • They are the most delicious oranges I've ever eaten.

   When we talk about more temporary situations we can often use either the present perfect
   continuous or the present perfect:

   - • 'Where's Dr Owen's office?' 'Sorry, I don't know. I've only worked / I've only been working

   here for a couple of days.'
   When we want to emphasise that a situation has changed over a period of time up to now, and
   may continue to change, we prefer the present perfect continuous to the present perfect:

   - • The pollution problem has been getting worse over the last decade.
   - • Sales have been increasing for some time.

   However, if we talk about a specific change over a period of time which ends now, particularly to
   focus on the result of this change (see A), we use the present perfect:

   - • Prices have decreased by 7%. {= in a period up to now)
   - • The population has grown from 35 million in 1950 to 42 million today.

   We use the past simple rather than the past perfect when we simply talk about a single activity or
   «event in the past:

   - • • I handed the letter to him. • Sorry we're late, we took the wrong turning.

   Notice the difference in meaning of these sentences with the past perfect and past simple:

   - • When he stopped laughing, everyone left. (= they left after he stopped laughing)
   - • When he stopped laughing, everyone had left. (= they left before he stopped laughing)
   - • I got up when the phone rang. (= the phone rang and then I got up)
   - • I had gone to bed when the phone rang. (= I went to bed and then the phone rang)

   When we give an account of a sequence
   of past events, we usually put these
   events in chronological order with the
   past simple. If we want to refer to an
   event out of order - that is, it happened
   before the last event we have talked
   about - we use the present perfect.
   Study the use of
   the past perfect
   and past simple

   Don Jose was a wealthy Cuban
   landowner who emigrated to Mexico in
   1959. The agricultural reforms had
   begun a few months earlier. He moved

   United States. He had made his fortune
   in growing sugar cane, and he brought
   his expertise to his new home.

   3 emigrated to Mexico 4 moved to US
   Order of account 1 emigrated to Mexico 2 reforms had begun {out of order)
   3 moved to US 4 had made fortune (out of order)
   We use the past perfect when we say what we wanted or hoped (etc.) to do, but didn't:

   - • I had wanted to visit the gallery before I left Florence, but it's closed on Sundays.
   - • Bill had hoped to retire at 60, but they persuaded him to stay on for a few more years.

   Other verbs used like this include expect (to), mean (to), think (about + -ing).
   When we use a time expression (e.g. after, as soon as, before, by the time (that), when) to say that
   one event happened after another, we use either the past simple or past perfect for the event that
   happened first and the past simple for the event that happened second:

   - • After Ivan (had) finished reading, he put out the light.
   - • When Carol (had) brushed her teeth, she went to bed.

   But to emphasise that the second event is the result of the first, we prefer the past simple for both:

   - • She became famous after she appeared on the TV programme.
   - • When the teacher came in, all the children stood up.

   With already and just (= a very short time before) we use the past perfect, not the past simple:

   - • They had been expecting the news for some time.
   - • She had been wearing high-heeled shoes, and her feet hurt.
   - • Mason was arrested, even though he hadn't been doing anything illegal.

   We use the past perfect continuous when we talk about a situation or activity that happened over
   a period up to a particular past time, or until shortly before it.
   D Compare how the past perfect continuous and the past perfect are used:

   - • She had been suffering from flu when she

   was interviewed.

   - • I'd been finishing some work in the

   garden and hadn't seen Sue come home.

   - • Bill had been saving since Christmas to

   - • She had suffered from asthma when she

   - • I'd finished all my work, so I had very little

   to do.

   - • Bill had saved enough money to buy the

   bike he wanted.
   У We use the past perfect continuous when we talk about the continuity or duration of a situation
   * or activity, and the past perfect to talk about the completion of a situation or activity or its effects.
   Sometimes the difference between them is simply one of emphasis (see also Unit 8A):

   - • I'd been working hard, so I felt that I deserved a holiday, (emphasises the activity)
   - • I'd worked hard, and the report was now finished, (emphasises the result)

   If we talk about how long something went on up to a particular past time, we prefer the past
   perfect continuous. If we talk about how many times something happened in a period up to a
   particular past time, we use the past perfect:

   - • They had been travelling for about 36 hours, (rather than They had travelled...)
   - • We had been looking at the painting for about ten minutes before we realised who the artist

   was. (rather than We had looked...)

   - • I'd heard the symphony many times before, (not I'd been hearing...)
   - • The teacher had let them get away with their bad behaviour once too often, (not ...had been

   letting them...)
   However, some verbs that describe states (see Unit 2A) are not often used with continuous tenses,
   and we use the past perfect with these even when we are talking about how long something went
   on up to a particular past time:

   - • I had always believed that it would be easy to get a job. (not I had always been believing...)
   - • We had owned the car for 6 months before we discovered it was stolen, (not We had been

   owning...)
   Compare the use of the past perfect continuous and past continuous:

   - • When we met Simon and Pat, they had been riding. (= we met after they had finished)
   - • When we met Simon and Pat, they were riding. (= we met while they were riding)
   - • When I got home, water had been leaking through the roof. (= it was no longer leaking

   Will + infinitive and going to + infinitive are commonly used to talk about the future. Sometimes
   the difference between them is very small:

   - • John'U / John's going to meet us in the restaurant at 8 o'clock.
   - • Will you / Are you going to come back this evening?

   However, going to is preferred in spoken English (where it is often pronounced /дэпэ/) and will is
   preferred in formal written English. (For other uses of will see Units 18 and 19.)
   In B-D below we focus on where there is a meaning difference.
   В ^
   e u s e 8 ОШ 8 t o r a ther than will when we PREDICT that something will happen in the future
   because we have some evidence for it now. It may be that we predict an event that is just about to
   happen on the basis of something that we feel, see (etc.) now:

   - • 'What's that matter with her?' 'She thinks she's going to faint.'

   or it may be that we can predict an event because we have been told that it will happen:

   - • Did you know that Bob and Kath are going to get married?

   However, if we make a prediction based on our opinion or our past experience we use will:

   - • Why not come over at the weekend? The children will enjoy seeing you again.
   - • I imagine the stadium will be full for the match on Saturday.

   When we talk about INTENTIONS or DECISIONS about the future that were made some time
   before we report them, we prefer going to or the present continuous (see Unit 12):

   - • 'Who's arranging the party?' 'Jo's going to do it.' (- this has been planned)
   - • Toni told me that she's going to move back to Spain. (= reporting an intention)

   However, notice that in a formal style, we use will rather than going to to talk about future events
   that have been previously arranged in some detail:

   - • The meeting will begin at 10.00 am. Coffee will be available from 9.30 onwards.

   When we state a decision made at the moment of speaking, we prefer will:

   - • 'Is that the phone?"Don't worry. I'll get it.' • It's late. I think I'll go to bed now.

   We can use will or going to with little difference in meaning in the main clause of an if-sentence
   when we say that something (often something negative) is conditional on something else - it will
   happen if something else happens first:

   - • If we go on like this, we'll / we're going to lose all our money.
   - • You'll / You're going to knock that glass over (if you're not more careful).

   However, we use will (or another auxiliary), not going to, when we describe a future event that
   follows another. Often 'if' has a meaning similar to 'when' in this kind of sentence:

   - • If you look carefully, you'll (or can) find writing scratched on the glass.
   - • If you move to your left, you'll (or may) be able to see the church.

   Shall (For other uses of shall, see Unit 25.)
   We can use shall (or shan't) instead of will (or won't) in statements about the future with I and
   we, although it is more common to use will/won't:

   - • When I retire, / shall/will have more time for my painting.
   - • The stronger we are, the more we shall/will be able to help others.
   - • In current English we don't use shall/shan't with other subjects (it, she, they, etc.) when we talk

   ' about the future.
   Will: willingness: Will: habits = Shall: permission and offers =

   rreseni continuous
   and going to
   am aoingj тог тпе титиге
   We use the present continuous and going to + infinitive (see also Unit 11С) to talk about future
   activities and events that are intended or have already been arranged:
   Q • She's making a speech at the conference next week.

   - • • Are you seeing Tony this week? (= do you have an arrangement to see him?)
   - • I'm tired. I'm not going to work any more tonight.
   - • We're going to do some climbing in the Pyrenees.

   We don't use will to talk about arrangements and intentions (but see Unit 11C):

   - • Apparently, the council are closing / are going to close the old library. (= reporting an

   arrangement) (not ...the council will close...)
   When we talk about an INTENTION to do something in the future, although no definite
   arrangement has been made, we prefer going to rather than the present continuous. To emphasise
   that we are talking about a DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT, we prefer the present continuous. Study
   these sentences:

   - • Before I go to China next year, I'm going

   to learn some Cantonese, (rather than
   ...I'm learning some Cantonese.)

   - • I'm still not feeling very well, so I think

   I'm going to see the doctor some time this
   week, (rather than ...I think I'm seeing the
   doctor...)

   - • What are you going to do next, now that

   you've finished your course? (rather than
   What are you doing next...)

   - • They're leaving from Frankfurt airport at

   6.30 pm. (rather than They're going to
   leave...)

   - • We're having a party on Sunday, 12th

   November. Can you come? (rather than
   We're going to have...)

   - • The orchestra is performing Mahler's 5th

   Symphony at next week's concert, (rather
   than ...is going to perform...)
   We don't use the present continuous for the future:

   - • when we make or report predictions about activities or events over which we have no control

   (we can't arrange these):

   - • I think it's going to rain / '11 rain soon, (not I think it's raining soon.)
   - • Scientists say that the satellite is going to fall / will fall to Earth some time this afternoon.

   (not ...the satellite is falling...)

   - • when we talk about permanent future situations:
   - • People are going to live / will live longer in the future, (not ...are living...)
   - • The brothers are going to own / will own most of the buildings in the street before long.

   (not ...are owning...)

   - • Her new house is going to have / will have three floors, (not ...is having...)
   - • with the verb be:
   - • John's going to be a shepherd in the school play next week, («of John's being...)
   - • I'm going to be in Tokyo in May. (not I'm being in Tokyo...)

   We tend to avoid going to + go and use the present continuous form of go instead:

   - • I'm going to town on Saturday, (rather than I'm going to go to town...)
   - • Alice is going to university next year, (rather than ...is going to go to university...)

   P r e s e n t s i m p l e ( I d o ) f o r t h e f u t u r e
   We use the present simple when we talk about future events that are part of some OFFICIAL
   ARRANGEMENT such as a timetable or programme:

   - • Their plane arrives at 2 o'clock in the morning.
   - • The next meeting of the committee is on November 5th.
   - • We get off the train in Bristol and continue by bus.
   - • I'm away on holiday next week. Can we meet the week after?

   We often use will + infinitive in sentences like these with little difference in meaning, although the
   present simple suggests that the arrangement is fixed and definite (See also Unit 11C).
   j D We don't use the present simple when we talk about PERSONAL PLANS or PREDICTIONS. Instead
   L
   we use will, going to, or the present continuous (see Units 11 and 12):

   - • I'm really exhausted. I'm just staying in to watch TV tonight, (not ...I just stay in...)
   - • Although it is a problem only in Britain at the moment, I think it will affect the rest of

   Europe soon, (not ...I think it affects the rest...)
   However, we prefer the present simple if we can make a definite, specific prediction because an
   activity or event is part of an official arrangement such as a timetable or programme (see A):

   - • There is a full moon tonight.
   - • The sun rises at 5.16 tomorrow.

   We use the present simple to refer to the future, not will, in adverbial clauses introduced by time
   conjunctions such as after, before, when, and until:
   О • After you go another 50 metres, you'll see a path to your left.

   - • • When you see Dennis, tell him he still owes me some money.
   - • Wait here until I call you.

   and in conditional clauses with if, unless, in case, and provided:

   - • Let me know if he says anything interesting.
   - • Provided the right software is available, I should be able to solve the problem.
   - • I'll bring a compass in case we get lost.

   We use the present simple in that- and tf/j-clauses when both the main clause and the that- /wb-
   clause refer to the future. We don't use will in the that-1 и^-clause in this kind of sentence:
   main clause
   I'm going to make sure
   I'll let you know
   that-1 wh-clause
   (that) you are invited next time, (not ...you will be invited...)
   when she gets here, (not ...when she will get here.)
   When the main clause refers to the present, we normally use will, not the present simple, in the
   that-1 wh-c\ause. However, if we are talking about a fixed arrangement we can use either will or
   the present simple. Compare:

   - • I guarantee that you'll enjoy the play, (not ...you enjoy...)
   - • It is fortunate that they arrive at the same time tomorrow, (or ...they will arrive...)

   Verb tense in that-clauses = Adverbials of time = Conditionals;

   F u t u r e c o n t i n u o u s ( w i l l b e d o i n g )
   We use will be + -ing (the future continuous) when we talk about an activity or event going on at a
   particular time or over a particular period in the future:
   О • Next Friday, the President will be celebrating ten years in power.

   - • • The plane will be travelling at twice the speed of sound when it passes overhead.
   - • After the operation you won't be doing any sport for a while.
   - • I will be saying more about that topic in my next lecture.

   With the future continuous we normally mention the future time (Next Friday etc.).
   We also use the future continuous when the future activity or event is the result of a previous
   decision or arrangement:

   - • He will be taking up his place at university in July, (the result of a previous decision)
   - • She will be performing every day until the end of the month, (part of a schedule)

   or of a routine activity:

   - • We'll be going to my brother's house again for Christmas, (we always go there)
   - • I'll be seeing Tony on Tuesday. That's when we usually meet.

   Future continuous and present continuous for the future
   We can often use either the future continuous or the present continuous when we talk about
   planned activities or events in the future (see also Unit 12):

   - • We will be leaving / are leaving for Istanbul at 7.00 in the evening.
   - • Professor Hodge will be giving / is giving the first presentation at the conference.

   But we prefer the present continuous to talk about surprising or unexpected activities or events:

   - • Have you heard the news? Dr Radford is leaving! (rather than ...will be leaving.)

   Future continuous and will
   Compare the use of will and the future continuous in these sentences:

   - • Ann will help us organise the party.

   (= she is willing to help)

   - • Will you come to the concert?

   (= an invitation)

   - • We'll join you in half an hour.

   (= I have just decided)

   - • Ann will be helping us to organise the party.

   (= a previous arrangement)

   - • Will you be coming to the concert?

   (= asking about a possible previous arrangement)

   - • We'll be joining you in half an hour.

   (= a previous arrangement)
   {$>When we use the future continuous, we are often referring simply to some future event or action
   *that has been previously arranged. However, we use will, not the future continuous, to talk about
   such things as decisions that people have made, willingness to do things, inviting, promising, etc.
   You can use the future continuous rather than will or the present continuous for the future to
   sound particularly polite when you ask about people's plans. For example, if you are asking about
   their plans because you want to ask them to do something unexpected or difficult. Compare:

   - • Are you starting work on the room today? and
   - • Will you be starting work on the room today? You see, I hope to use it for a meeting tomorrow.
   - • What time are you coming to baby-sit? and
   - • What time will you be coming to baby-sit? We have to be at the theatre by 7 o'clock.

   It is often possible to use going to be + ing rather than the future continuous to ask about plans
   in a particularly polite way:

   - • Are you going to be starting work on the room today?

   be 10 + inTinmve (i am ю aoj, тишге регтеих
   (I will have done), and future perfect
   continuous (I will have been doing)
   Be to + infinitive
   Be to + infinitive is used to talk about formal or official arrangements, formal instructions, and to
   give orders. It is particularly common in news reports to talk about future events.
   Children are
   not to be left
   unsupervised
   in the
   museum.
   You are not to
   leave the school
   without my
   permission.
   The medicine
   is to be taken
   after meals.
   We only use be to + infinitive to talk about things that can be controlled by people:

   - • We don't know where the meteorite is going to land, (not ...the meteorite is to land.)
   - • I suppose we will all die eventually, (not ...we are all to die...)

   | D We often use be to + infinitive in //-clauses to say that something must take place first (in the main
   clause) before something else can take place (in the //-clause):

   - • //humans are to survive as a species, we must address environmental issues now.
   - • The law needs to be revised //justice is to be done, (passive form)

   Compare the use of be to + infinitive and the present simple for the future in //-clauses:

   - • Jones needs to improve his technique //he is to win gold at the next Olympics, and
   - • Jones has said that he will retire from athletics //he wins gold at the next Olympics.

   Future perfect
   We use the future perfect to say that something will be ended, completed, or achieved by a
   particular point in the future (see also Unit 18B):
   a • Let's hope the volcanic eruption will have finished before we arrive on the island.

   - • • Although people are now angry about what he did, I'm sure that his behaviour will soon

   have been forgotten. (= passive form)

   - • By the time you get home I will have cleaned the house from top to bottom.

   Notice that we can use other modal verbs instead of will to talk about the future in a less certain
   way:

   - • By the time you get home I will/may/should have cleaned the house...

   Future perfect continuous
   We can use the future perfect continuous to emphasise how long something has been going on by
   a particular point in the future:

   - • On Saturday, we will have been living in this house for a year.
   - • Next year I will have been working in the company for 30 years.

   In sentences with the future perfect continuous we usually mention both the particular point in
   the future ('On Saturday...', 'Next year...') and the period of time until this point ('...for a year',
   '...for 20 years'). Notice that we don't usually use the future perfect continuous with verbs
   describing states (see Unit 2):

   - • Next month I will have known Derek for 20 years, (not ...will have been knowing...)

   There are a number of ways of talking about an activity or event that was in the future at a
   particular point in the past. In order to express this idea, we can use the past tenses of the verb
   forms we would normally use to talk about the future (will - would, is going to - was going to, is
   leaving - was leaving, is to talk - was to talk, etc.). Compare the following sentences:
   The future from now...

   - • The new computer will arrive next week.
   - • I'm going to grow tomatoes and carrots

   this summer.

   - • I'm collecting my mother from the station

   this afternoon.

   - • As it's raining, I think I'll be going home

   by taxi.

   - • The exam will have finished by 3 o'clock,

   so I'll see you then.

   - • The Prime Minister has announced that

   there is to be an election on May 1st.

   - • The workers are to be transferred to a

   new factory on the outskirts of town.

   - • The performance is about to begin. Please

   take your seats, ladies and gentlemen.
   The future from the past...

   - • Our computer was broken and we hoped

   the new one would arrive soon.

   - • During the winter I decided that I was

   going to grow tomatoes and carrots
   when the summer came.
   n • I left the meeting early because I was

   - • collecting my mother at 3.30.
   - • Jane she said that she would be going

   home by taxi because of the rain.

   - • The exam was so easy that most people

   would have finished after 30 minutes.

   - • I was on holiday in Greece when I heard

   there was to be an election back home.

   - • She was given a tour of the factory where

   she was later to be transferred.

   - • The performance was about to begin

   when someone started screaming.
   The context in which these forms are used will often indicate whether the activity or event did or
   did not happen, although in some cases we may not know whether the activity or event happened
   or not. Compare:

   - • I was seeing Jim later that day, but I had to phone and cancel. (= I didn't see Jim)
   - • I didn't phone to break the news to him because we were seeing each other later. He was

   very upset when I told him. (= we saw each other)

   - • They left the house at 6.00 am and would reach Edinburgh some 12 hours later. (= they

   reached Edinburgh)

   - • He was sure that the medical tests would show that he was healthy. (= we don't know

   whether he was healthy or not)
   Compare was/were to + infinitive and was/were to have + past participle used to talk about an
   activity or event that was in the future at a particular point in the past:
   « A t the time she was probably the best actor in the theatre company, but in fact some of her
   colleagues were to become much better known.

   - • He was to find out years later that the car he had bought was stolen.
   - • I was to have helped with the performance, but I got flu the day before.
   - • There was to have been a ban on smoking in restaurants, but restaurant owners have forced

   the council to reconsider.
   When we use was/were to + infinitive we are talking about something that did actually happen.
   When we use was/were to have + past participle we are talking about something that had been
   arranged, but did not happen.

   S h o u l d a n d o u g h t t o
   ( д We can often use should or ought to with little difference in meaning when we talk about
   OBLIGATION and PROBABILITY.
   Obligation

   - • giving ADVICE or making a RECOMMENDATION:
   - • 'This soup is too salty!' 'You should / ought to send it back.'
   - • You'll catch cold if you go out like that. I think you should / ought to take a hat.

   or saying what an outside authority recommends (although we prefer should in this case):

   - • The manual says that the computer should be disconnected (= passive) from the mains

   before the cover is removed, (rather than ...ought to be disconnected...)
   However, we use should (or would), not ought to, when we give advice with I:

   - • I should leave early tomorrow, if I were you. (or I would leave...; or I'd leave...)
   - • talking about a RESPONSIBILITY or DUTY:
   - • People should / ought to be warned (= passive) of the danger of swimming off this beach.
   - • I should / ought to visit my parents more often.

   Probability

   - • saying that something is PROBABLY TRUE now or will probably be true in the future:
   - • 'Have we got any string?' 'There should / ought to be some in the kitchen drawer.'

   (because that's where we always keep it)

   - • You should / ought to have received the report by now.
   - • I enjoyed her first novel, so the new one should / ought to be good.

   We use should / ought to + have + past participle to talk about an obligation in the past. We often
   indicate some criticism or regret:

   - • He should / ought to have asked me before he took my bike. (I'm annoyed)
   - • We should / ought to have taken a taxi when it rained. (I'm sorry we didn't)

   We also use should / ought to + have + past participle to talk about an expectation that something
   happened, has happened, or will happen:

   - • If the flight was on time, he should / ought to have arrived in Jakarta early this morning.
   - • The builders should / ought to have finished by the end of the week.

   We can use had better instead of should / ought to, especially in spoken English, to say that we
   think it would be sensible or advisable to do something. However, we don't use it to talk about
   the past or to make general comments:

   - • If you're not well, you should / ought to ask Ann to go instead, (or ...you'd better ask...)
   - • You should / ought to have caught a later train, (not You had better have...)
   - • I don't think parents should / ought to give their children sweets, (not ...had better...)

   When we make a logical conclusion from some situation or activity, we use must not should or
   ought to (for more on must, see Unit 23):
   a • You must be mad if you think I'm going to lend you any more money.

   - • • It's the third time she's been skating this week - she must really enjoy it.

   We can use (be) supposed to instead of should / ought to to talk about an obligation to do
   something. It is commonly used in spoken English to express a' less strong obligation:

   - • I'm supposed to be there at 10.00. • The work was supposed to start last week.

   We use (be) supposed to when we report what many people think is true:

   - • Eating sweets is supposed to be bad for your teeth, (not ...should be bad for...)

   We use will (or '11) when we talk about WILLINGNESS to do something (e.g. in offers, invitations,
   requests, and orders) and will not (or won't) when we talk about UNWILLINGNESS to do
   something (e.g. reluctance, refusal):

   - • I'll give you another opportunity to get the correct answer.
   - • Mum! Sue won't give me back my pencil case.

   Notice that we can also talk about the refusal of a thing to work in the way it should:

   - • The top won't come off. • The key won't fit the lock.

   To talk about general or repeated willingness in the past we can sometimes use would, but we
   can't use would in this way to talk about a particular occasion in the past. Compare:

   - • Whenever I had to go to town, Ron would give me a lift. (= repeated)
   - • I was late, so Ron gave me a lift to town, (not ...Ron would give me...) (= particular occasion)

   However, we can use would not either when we talk about unwillingness in general or about a
   particular occasion. Compare:

   - • We thought that people wouldn't / would buy the book. (= general)
   - • She wouldn't say what was wrong when I asked, (not ...would say...) (= particular occasion)

   We use will (or won't) to indicate that we think a present or future situation is CERTAIN:

   - • You will know that John and Sheila are engaged. (= you already know)
   - • 'Shall I ask Sandra?' 'No, don't disturb her - she'll be working.'
   - • We won't see them again before Christmas.

   We can use will (for the present) and would (for the past) to talk about characteristic behaviour or
   habits, or about things that are or were always true:

   - • Every day Dan will come home from work and turn on the TV.
   - • During the war, people would eat all kinds of things that we don't eat now.
   - • A baby will recognise its mother's voice soon after it is born.
   - • Early passenger planes wouldn't hold more than 30 passengers.

   We don't use would in this way to talk about a particular occasion in the past. Compare:

   - • Each time I gave him a problem he would solve it for me. and
   - • Last night I gave him a problem and he solved it for me. {not ...he would solve it...)

   In speech, we can stress will or would to criticise people's characteristic behaviour or habits:

   - • She will leave all the lights on in the house when she goes out.
   - • I was happy when Sam left. He would talk about people behind their backs.

   When we use stressed would in this way, we can also use it to talk about a particular occasion in
   the past. We suggest that what happened was predictable because it was typical of a person's
   behaviour:

   - • 'Jackie says she can't help because she's got a lot of work on.' 'Well she would say that - she

   always uses that excuse.'
   If we want to talk about things that happened repeatedly in the past, but don't happen now, we
   can use would or used to + infinitive. Used to is more common in informal English:

   - • We would / used to lend him money when he was unemployed.
   - • Tim would / used to visit his parents every other weekend.

   We use used to but not would when we talk about past states that have changed:
   n • The factory used to be in the city centre.

   - • • I used to smoke heavily when I was at university.

   When we use would we need to mention a specific time or set of occasions. Compare:

   - • We used to play in the garden, {not We would play...)
   - • Whenever we went to my Uncle Frank's house, we would / used to play in the garden.

   We don't use either used to or would when we say exactly how many times something
   happened, how long something took, or that something happened at a particular time:
   a • We visited Switzerland four times during the 1970s.

   - • • She went on holiday to the Bahamas last week.

   Study how we normally make questions and negatives with used to in spoken English:

   - • Did your children use to sleep well when they were babies?
   - • I didn't use to like visiting the dentist when I was young.

   These forms are sometimes written as '...did ... used to...' and '...didn't used to...', but some
   people think this is incorrect.
   However, in more formal spoken and written English the following negative and question forms
   are also used, although this question form is now rare:

   - • There used not to be so much traffic, {more likely is There didn't use to be...)
   - • Used you to go to university with the Evans brothers? {more likely is Did you use to...?)

   Notice that nowadays very few people use used to in tags:

   - • He used to play cricket for Australia, didn't he? {rather than ..., usedn't he?)

   In affirmative sentences (that is, sentences which are not questions or negatives), we use may or
   might to say there is a possibility of something happening or being true:

   - • The news may/might come as a shock to many of the people present.
   - • When Frank gets a job, I may/might get the money back that I lent him.

   There is often little difference in meaning, but might can suggest that there is less possibility.
   We can also use could, but not can, to express a similar meaning. We prefer could to show that
   we are giving an opinion about which we are unsure:
   n • 'Why isn't Tim here yet?' 'It may/might/could be because his mother is ill again.'

   - • • There may/might/could be some cake left. I'll go and look.

   We can use can in affirmative sentences when we talk about a more general possibility of
   something happening rather than the possibility of something happening in a particular
   situation:

   - • The temperature can sometimes reach 35°C in July.
   - • Mountain daisies can be yellow or red.
   - • It may/might/could rain later, {not It can...)

   We prefer may rather than can in more formal contexts:

   - • Exceeding the stated dose may cause drowsiness, (from a medicine container)

   We don't use may to ask questions about the possibility of something happening. Instead we
   use, for example, could(n't) or the phrase be likely:
   a • Could it be that you don't want to leave?

   - • • Are you likely to be visiting Greece again this summer?

   It is possible to use might in this type of question, but it is rather formal:

   - • Might they be persuaded to change their minds?

   In negative sentences, including sentences with words like only, hardly or never, to say that
   something is not the case we can use can't (or more formally cannot) or couldn't (or could not):

   - • There can't/couldn't be any milk left -1 would have seen it in the fridge.
   - • There can/could hardly be any doubt that he was guilty.

   Compare the use of may/might and can/could in negative sentences:

   - • There are plans to rebuild the town centre, but it may not / might not happen for another

   ten years. (= It is possible that it won't happen for another ten years.)

   - • There are plans to rebuild the town centre, but it can't/couldn't happen for another ten

   years. (= It is not possible that it will happen for another ten years.)
   The difference is that we use may not or might not to say that it is possible that something is not
   true, and can't or couldn't to say that it is not possible that something is true.
   We use may well, might well or could well to say it is likely that something will happen:

   - • The profits of the company may/might/could well reach $100 million this year.

   We don't use can well in this way to talk about the future. However, can well is used to talk
   about something we think or feel now:

   - • I can well recall how I felt when John told us he was moving to South Africa.

   Other words commonly used after may, might, could and can to say it is possible that something
   will happen are conceivably and possibly:

   - • The President may conceivably call an election in June. (= it is possible to believe it)
   - • The new parking restrictions could possibly lead to fewer cars in our cities.

   (= talking about present or future possibility)

   - • Jenny's late. She may/might/could have forgotten about the meeting. (= talking about past

   possibility)
   We use may/might/could (not 'can') + have + past participle to say it is possible that something
   happened in the past:
   л • I thought I saw Tom in town, but I may/might could have been wrong.

   - • • 'Where's Barbara's camera?' 'She may/might/could have taken it with her.'

   We use might/could (not 'may' or 'can') + have + past participle to say that something was
   possible in the past, but we know that it did not in fact happen:

   - • If I hadn't come along at that moment, Jim might/could have been the one arrested instead

   of the real thief.

   - • The plan might/could easily have gone wrong, but in fact it was a great success.

   - • During the war, the police might arrest you for criticising the king.
   - • Years ago children might be sent down mines at the age of six. (passive form)

   We can also use could + infinitive in examples like this to talk about past ability (see Unit 22). For
   example, 'During the war, the police could arrest you...' means that the police were legally able to
   arrest you.
   D We use may/might (not 'can') + have + past participle to say that by some time in the future, it is
   possible that something will have happened:

   - • By next Friday I may/might have completed the report.
   - • His maths may/might have improved by the time the exam comes round.

   We use may/might (not 'can') + be + -ing to say it is possible that something is happening now or

   - • Malcolm isn't in his office. He may/might be working at home today.
   - • When I go to Vienna I may/might be staying with Richard, but I'm not sure yet.

   Could can be used in the same patterns instead of may or might, particularly when we want to
   show that we are unsure about the possibility.
   Notice that we can combine these two patterns to talk about possible situations or activities that
   went on over a period of time until now (see also Unit 8):

   - • David didn't know where the ball was, but he thought his sister might have been playing

   with it. (= from a past time until now)
   О We use may/might/could + well/conceivably/possibly + have + past participle (compare Unit
   20D) to say it is likely that something would have happened in the past if circumstances had been
   different, or to say that by some time in the future it is likely that something will have happened.
   (Notice that we don't use 'can well (etc.) + have + past participle'):

   - • I may/might/could conceivably have been tempted to take the job if it had been nearer

   When we say that someone or something has or doesn't have the ability to do something, we can
   use can('t) (or cannot) (for the present) or could(n't) (for the past):

   - • He can analyse people's handwriting. • We can't afford to pay the bill.
   - • Anita could speak three languages before she was six.

   We can use be able to instead of can/could to talk about an ability that someone has or had:

   - • Helen can / is able to read well, even though she's only three.
   - • He could / was able to draw on the support of over 20,000 troops.

   In general, we use be able to when we talk about a specific achievement (particularly if it is
   difficult, requiring some effort) rather than a general ability. Study this table:
   present
   past
   general ability
   We prefer can (but can also use be
   able to):

   - • He can speak Spanish.

   We prefer could (but can also use be
   able to):

   - • After only six months, Suzanne

   could play the violin quite well.
   specific achievement
   We prefer be able to (but can also use can):

   - • He has now recovered from his injury

   and is able to drive again.
   We use be able to (not could):

   - • Jenny was able to leave the hospital

   only six hours after the baby was born.
   However, we commonly use can or could, even when we are talking about specific occasions,
   with verbs of the senses, feel, hear, see, smell, taste, and with verbs of 'thinking', e.g. believe,
   decide, remember, understand:
   n • She could feel the spray on her face as the boat raced through the water.

   - • • I can't decide where to go for my holidays.

   We don't use be able to

   - • when we talk about something that

   is happening as we are speaking:

   - • before be + past participle:
   - • This furniture can be assembled by anyone, with just a screwdriver.

   We use be able to, not can or could, if the idea we want to express needs a to-infinitive, an -ing
   form, or a perfect tense, or if it follows another modal verb:

   - • We were very lucky to be able to live in the country during our childhood.
   - • It was awful, not being able to see you for so long.
   - • Since he left, none of the other team members have been able to match his enthusiasm.
   - • We may be able to move some of the staff to a different department.

   We use will be able to, not can, to say that something will be possible in the future:
   a • If the snow carries on like this, very few people will be able to get to the concert.

   - • • When the new road is built, I'll be able to drive to work in under half an hour.

   However, when we make a decision now about something in the future, we use can:

   - • You can go home when you've finished writing your composition.
   - • Perhaps we can meet next week.

   Д When we say that it is NECESSARY to do something, we use must or have (got) to:

   - • To get a cheap ticket, you must / have (got) to book in advance.
   - • Every animal on the island must / has (got) to be destroyed.

   When we want to say that it will be necessary for someone to do something in the future, we use
   must, have (got) to, or will have to:

   - • To get there on time, I must / have (got) to / will have to leave home by 8.30.

   Have got to is less formal than the others, and is particularly common in spoken English. We can
   often use need (to) with a similar meaning:

   - • Before you buy a house, you need to / must / have (got) to consider all the costs.

   (For mustn't and haven't got to / don't have to, see Unit 24.)
   D Using have (got) to suggests that someone else or some outside circumstances or authority makes
   something necessary.We use must when the speaker decides it is necessary. Compare:

   - • I have to see the head teacher, (...she has called me to her office)
   - • I must see the head teacher. (...I want to discuss something with her)

   We prefer have (got) to when we talk about a necessity that is characteristic of a person:

   - • Ann has got to have at least eight hours' sleep a night.
   - • She has to drink two cups of coffee in the morning before she feels really awake.

   О We normally use must, not have (got) to, when we CONCLUDE that something (has) happened or
   that something is true (see also Unit 17D):

   - • With that pile of papers on his desk, Tony must be wishing he'd never taken the job.
   - • The hall's packed. There must be about 2,000 people at the meeting.

   However, in informal speech, we can use have (got) to:

   - • Look at all those penguins. There's got to be about a million of them!
   - • You want to borrow more money from me? You've got to be joking!

   When we give a negative conclusion we rarely use either must not or hasn't / haven't got to.
   Instead, we use can't (cannot) or couldn't:

   - • 'I'm seeing Dr Evans next week.' 'That can't be right. He's on holiday then.'
   - • He wasn't there at the time. It couldn't have been his fault.

   Must has no other forms than the present tense (no past tense, no participles, etc.) and in past
   tense sentences which say that it was necessary to do something, we use had to instead:

   - • Bill's not here. He had to leave early. • The car broke down and we had to get a taxi.

   To draw a conclusion about something in the past, we use must + have + past participle:

   - • You must have been upset when you heard the news.
   - • She must have played really well to win. I wish I'd seen the match.

   Sometimes we can use either have to or have got to. However, we prefer have to with frequency
   adverbs such as always, never, normally, rarely, sometimes, etc.:

   - • I often have to work at the weekend to get everything done.

   With the past simple, we use had to, especially in questions and negative sentences:

   - • When did you have to give the books back? {not When had you got to...)
   - • We didn't have to wait too long for an answer, (not We hadn't got to...)

   After contracted forms of have, has or had (e.g. I've, He's, It'd) we use got:

   - • It's got to work this time, [not It's to work...)

   In formal English we prefer have to rather than have got to.

   Mustn't and needn't / don't have to
   We use mustn't to say that something is NOT ALLOWED and needn't (or don't need to) or don't
   have to to say that something is NOT NECESSARY:

   - • You mustn't walk on the grass here.
   - • You mustn't put anything on the shelves until the glue has set hard.
   - • They proved that watching a chess match needn't be boring.
   - • We needn't go into details now, but we seem to agree on the general principles.

   D Need, needn't, and don't need to / don't have to
   Need can be used as a modal verb (before a bare infinitive) or as an ordinary verb. Compare:
   a • You needn't speak so loudly. (= modal verb)

   - • • She needn't come with us if she doesn't want to. (= modal verb)
   - • She's thirsty. She needs a drink. (= ordinary verb)
   - • Jim and Bob are here. They say they need to see you urgently. (= ordinary verb)

   When it is a modal verb need is most commonly used in negative sentences, although it is
   sometimes also used in questions:

   - • Need you go home so soon? (or, more commonly Do you have to go...?)
   - • Need I say more? (or, more commonly Do I have to say...?)

   We can use either needn't or don't have to when we say that is unnecessary to do something:

   - • It would be ood to see youbut you needn't (or don't have to) come if you're busy.

   g y , y (

   - • You needn't (or don't have to) whisper. Nobody can hear us.

   Compare these uses of needn't and don't need to.
   To give permission not to do
   something we can use either
   needn't or don't need to:

   - • You needn't cut the grass, I'll do it later. /
   - • You don't need to cut the grass, I'll do it later. /

   To talk about a general necessity,
   we prefer don't need to:
   You don't need to be over 18 to get into a disco. /
   You needn't be over 18 to get into a disco. X
   Didn't need to / didn't have to and need not have
   When we say that it was not necessary to do something in the past, and it wasn't done, we use
   didn't need to or didn't have to. To show that we think something that was done was not, in
   fact, necessary we use need not have:

   - • Chris and June phoned to say that they couldn't come to eat, so I didn't need/have to cook

   dinner. (= I didn't cook the dinner)

   - • I needn't have cooked dinner. Just as it was ready, Chris and June phoned to say that they

   couldn't come to eat. (= I did cook the dinner)
   Study how we use need with scarcely, hardly, and only, particularly in formal contexts:

   - • We need hardly point out that there is a water shortage at the moment. (= it is almost

   unnecessary for us to point out...)

   - • I need scarcely add that you will be missed. (= it is almost unnecessary for me to add...)
   - • The changes need only be small to make the proposals acceptable.

   '...hardly need to point out...,' '...scarcely need to add...' and '...only need to be...' are also
   possible, and less formal.

   Д To ask PERMISSION to do something we use can or could:

   - • Can/Could I take another biscuit?

   We use could to be particularly polite. If we want to put extra pressure on someone to give a
   positive answer we can use can't or couldn't. For example, you might use couldn't where you
   expect that the answer is likely to be 'no', or where permission has been refused before:

   - • Can't/Couldn't we stay just a little bit longer? Please?

   To give and refuse permission we use can and can't:

   - • Okay. You can stay in the spare room. • No, you can't have another chocolate.

   Q Notice that we prefer can/can't rather than could/couldn't to give or refuse permission:

   - • • I'm sorry, no, you can't borrow the car tonight, (rather than ...no, you couldn't...)

   In rather formal English, may (not) can also be used to ask, give or refuse permission, and might
   can be used to ask permission (e.g. 'Might I ask...?').
   D We use can (for the present or the future) and could (for the past) to report permission (see Unit
   49 for more on the choice between can and could in reporting):

   - • Jim says that we can borrow his house as long as we leave it clean and tidy.
   - • He said we can/could use the car, too.

   To report that in the past someone had general permission to do something, that is, to do it at
   any time, we can use either could or was/were allowed to. However, to report permission for
   one particular past action, we use was/were allowed to, but not could:

   - • Last century, women were not allowed to vote, (or ...couldn't vote.)
   - • Although he didn't have a ticket, Ken was allowed to come in. (not ...could come in.)

   In negative sentences, we can use either couldn't or wasn't/weren't allowed to to report that
   permission was not given in general or particular situations:

   - • We couldn't / weren't allowed to open the presents until Christmas.

   If we use the present perfect, past perfect or an infinitive, we use be allowed to, not can/could:

   - • They have been allowed to keep the Roman coins they found in their garden.
   - • She is unlikely to be allowed to travel on that airline again.

   I* When we OFFER to do something, or offer by making a suggestion, we can use can or could:

   - • Can/Could I help you with your bags? • You can/could borrow my car if you want.

   In offers that are questions we can also use shall or should:

   - • Shall/Should I phone for a taxi for you?

   If we use could or should we sound less certain that the offer will be accepted.
   We also use shall/should in questions that request confirmation or advice:

   - • Shall/Should I put these books over here? • Who shall/should I pass the message to?

   We can use Would (you) like when we make an offer, but not 'Will...':

   - • Would you like me to get you some water? (not Will you like me...?)

   о In requests, too, we can say (I) would like..., but not '(I) will...':

   - • • I would (or 'd) like an orange juice, («of I'll like...)

   We can use should (with I or we) instead of would in requests like this, but this is formal.
   Compare these ways of offering food and drink:

   - • What will you have to eat/drink? (not What would you have to eat/drink?)
   - • What would you like to eat/drink? (not What will you like to eat/drink?)

   In the following sentences we use an adjective or noun after a verb to describe the subject or say
   what or who the subject is:

   - • Ian is a doctor. • She seemed unable to concentrate.
   - • The house became Peter's in 1980.

   The adjective or noun in sentences like this is called a complement; the verb is called a linking
   verb. The most common linking verb is be; others include become, come, grow, turn; keep,
   remain, stay; appear, look, seem, sound.
   appear, seem
   After appear (= seems true) and seem we sometimes use to be before an adjective:

   - • He seems/appears (to be) very nervous.

   We include to be before the adjectives alive, alone, asleep, and awake:

   - • I didn't go in because she appeared to be asleep, (not ...appeared asleep.)

   Before a noun we include to be when the noun tells us who or what the subject is, but can often
   leave it out when we give our opinion of the person or thing in the subject. We leave out to be in
   more formal English. Compare:

   - • He went through what appeared to be a locked door, (not ...appeared a locked door.)
   - • She seems (to be) a very efficient salesperson.

   nNotice that we include to be before -ing forms (growing, moving, etc.):

   - • • It seems to be growing rapidly.

   become, come, get, go, grow, turn (into)
   We use the linking verb become to describe a process of change. A number of other linking verbs
   can be used instead of become, including come, get, go, grow, turn (into).
   We use get rather than become in informal speech and writing, in imperatives, and in phrases
   such as get broken, get dressed, get killed, get lost, get married, get washed:

   - • Don't get upset about it! • Where did you live before you got married}

   We prefer become when we talk about a more abstract or technical process of change:

   - • He became recognised as the leading authority on the subject.
   - • Their bodies have become adapted to living at high altitudes.

   We use become, not get, if there is a noun after the linking verb describing a change of job:

   - • Dr Smallman became an adviser to the US government.

   We use go or turn, not get, when we talk about colours changing:

   - • The traffic lights turned/went green and I pulled away.

   We often use go when we talk about changing to an undesirable state. For example, we use go,
   not turn or get, when we say that somebody becomes deaf, blind, bald, or starts to behave in a
   mad or excited way; and also in phrases such as go bad/off/mouldy (food), go dead (a telephone),
   go missing, and go wrong.

   - • The children went completely crazy at the party. • My computer's gone wrong again.

   We use turn to say that somebody reaches a particular age, and turn into when we say that one
   material or thing becomes another:

   - • He turned sixty last year. • In my dream all the sheep turned into wolves.

   After the verbs come, get, and grow we can use a to-infinitive. Come and grow are often used to
   talk about gradual change. We can't use a to-infinitive after become:

   - • I eventually came/grew to appreciate his work, (not ...became to appreciate...)
   - • I soon got to know their names, (not ...became to know...)

   Have and have got
   Sometimes we can use either have or have got when we talk about POSSESSION, RELATIONSHIPS,
   and similar meanings. Using have is often more formal:

   - • She has a house in Italy, or She's got a house in Italy.
   - • The President has a lot of support for her actions, or The President has got a lot...
   - • I don't have anything on this weekend, or I haven't got anything on this weekend. (Both are

   more natural than T haven't anything...')

   - • Does 'bird watching' have a hyphen, or not? or Has 'bird watching' got a hyphen, or not?

   (Both are more natural than 'Has 'bird watching' a hyphen...?')
   We use have, not have got, in to-infinitive or -ing forms, and after modal verbs:

   - • Do you want to have a drink?
   - • I find having no car very inconvenient.
   - • She won't have that old bike for much longer. She's getting a new one.

   Notice that we don't use have got in short answers:

   - • 'Have we got any biscuits left?' 'Yes, we have. In the cupboard.'

   We use have rather than have got when we talk about the future or the past. Compare:

   - • I have time to do the work now. (or I've got time...) and
   - • I will have time to do the work tomorrow, (not I will have got time...)
   - • She has a racing bike, (or She's got a racing bike.) and
   - • She had a racing bike when she was a teenager, (rather than She had got...)

   We also say used to have not 'used to have got'.
   Notice, however, that when have got is the perfect form of get meaning 'OBTAIN' or 'RECEIVE', we
   can use it in to-infinitive or -ing forms, after modal verbs, and in the past and future. We can
   sometimes use have instead of have got with a similar meaning:
   Q • I'm very pleased to have got a place on the course, (or ...to have a place...)

   - • • I could have got much more for the painting if I'd sold it overseas, (not ...could have...)
   - • He asked me where I had got my jacket from, (rather than ...where I had my jacket...)
   - • I hope you will have got your marks by tomorrow, (or ...you will have your marks...)

   Have and take
   We can use have + noun to describe an action. Compare:

   - • We argued, or • We had an argument. • I slept, or • I had a sleep.

   Here are some other nouns that are commonly used with have: a chat, a dance, an effect, a fall,
   a meal, a quarrel, a say (= be involved in deciding something), something to eat, a talk, a wash,
   a word (= a brief discussion).
   With some nouns we can use take but not have:

   - • Don isn't here now. Would you like me to take a message?
   - • Calm down! Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.

   , Other nouns like this include care, a chance, a decision (or make a decision), a dislike to, a
   »photo(graph), power, responsibility, a risk, the trouble.
   With some nouns we can use either have or take, but take is often more formal:

   - • Would you like to have a walk with me, Richard? (or ...take a walk...)

   Other nouns like this include a bath, a break, a drink, an exam / a test, a guess, a holiday,
   a look, a nap, a rest, a shower, a sip, a stroll, a swim.

   1 We often use do with certain nouns to describe activities, or things that have an effect on people:

   - • I can't wash up -I have to do my homework.
   - • The campaign may have done more harm than good.

   »Other nouns commonly used with do include business, damage, (an) exercise, (somebody) a
   »favour, (no) good (or not (do) any good), housework, (somebody) an injury, a job, research.
   In informal English, we can use do instead of another verb to talk about certain jobs:

   - • Can you do the shoes before the children go to school? (= clean the shoes)
   - • Aren't you going to do your hair? It looks untidy. (= comb/brush your hair)

   We can also use do instead of, for example: arrange (flowers), cook or make (a curry), cut (nails,
   hair), make (beds), tidy (a cupboard, a desk, a garden).
   We also use do when we talk about general or indefinite rather than particular activities:

   - • I think David has done something to the computer. I can't get it to work.
   - • Did you do anything about the broken window this morning?

   We sometimes specify particular actions after first introducing the actions in general with do:

   - • I did a huge amount yesterday. I finished the report, I ordered some new textbooks...

   We use do with an -ing form as a noun when we talk about jobs and leisure activities. A word or
   phrase such as the, some, a bit of, a lot of, etc. is usually used before the noun:

   - • I normally do the ironing while I'm watching TV.
   - • He's hoping to do a bit of skiing while he's visiting Bernard in Austria.

   We also use do to talk about cleaning, cooking, gardening, shopping, washing (up).
   Compare:

   - • I'm going to paint. and • I'm going to do some painting.
   - • I'm going to read some books, (but not I'm going to do some book reading.)

   Normally, if there is an object (e.g. 'some books') after the verb, we can't make a sentence
   with a similar meaning with do ... -ing. However, we can talk in this way about bird watching,
   letter-writing, note-taking, sightseeing (see also Unit 54).
   To talk about constructing or creating something we use make rather than do:

   - • The firm I work for makes children's clothes.
   - • I cut out the pieces, but she made the model all by herself.
   - • I made some fresh coffee and gave her a cup.

   We also use make with certain nouns, particularly when we are talking about an action that
   j someone performs:
   » • Try not to make a noise\ • She made an offer for my car that I accepted.
   Other nouns commonly used with make include an announcement, an application, an
   arrangement, an attempt, a choice, a comment, a contribution, a decision, a difference, a
   discovery, an enquiry, an excuse, a habit of doing something, a list, a journey, a mistake, money,
   a (phone) call, a plan, a point, a promise, a remark, a sound, a speech, a suggestion.
   We can use make to say how successful someone was or would be in a particular job or.
   position, or how successful something was or would be for a particular purpose:

   - • He would probably have made an excellent prime minister.
   - • That old table would (or will) make a good place to put the television.

   \ A Passive verb forms have one of the tenses of the verb to be and a past participle. Passive verb
   forms are summarised in Appendix 1.
   Verbs which take an object (transitive verbs) can have a passive form. So we can make
   corresponding passive sentences for:

   - • They destroyed the building. «—• The building was destroyed.
   - • The news surprised me. «—• I was surprised by the news.

   Verbs which do not take an object (intransitive verbs) do not have passive forms. For example,
   there are no passive forms for the following sentences:

   - • I slept for nearly ten hours last night.
   - • The ship slowly disappeared from view.

   A good dictionary will tell you whether verbs are transitive or intransitive.
   However, many verbs can be used at different times with and without objects - that is, they can
   be both transitive and intransitive. Compare:

   - • Are they meeting him at the station? (transitive) Is he being met at the airport? (passive)
   - • When shall we meet? (intransitive; no passive possible)

   В Verbs that can be followed by either object + object or object + prepositional object in active
   clauses (see Unit 42) can have two corresponding passive forms. The passive form you choose
   depends on which is more appropriate in a particular context. Compare:
   active

   - • She handed me the plate. /
   - • She handed the plate to me. /

   passive

   - • I was handed the plate. /
   - • The plate was handed to me. /

   Other verbs like this include give, lend, offer, promise, sell, teach, tell, throw. However,
   verbs that can't be followed by object + object in the active have only one of these
   passive forms:
   He described me the situation.
   He described the situation to me.

   - • I was described the situation.
   - • The situation was described to me.

   »Other verbs like this include demonstrate, explain, introduce, mention, report, suggest.
   We can make a passive form of transitive two- and three-word verbs (see Unit 114). Compare:

   - • Martha talked me into buying a motorbike. (= V + object + preposition) and
   - • I was talked into buying a motorbike by Martha.
   - • They gave over the whole programme to a report from Bosnia. (= V + adverb + object +

   preposition) and

   - • The whole programme was given over to a report from Bosnia.

   Some transitive two- and three-word verbs are rarely used in the passive:

   - • We got the money back for her, but it took ages, (rather than The money was got back...)
   - • I had to put out a hand to steady myself, (rather than A hand was put out...)

   Other verbs like this include get down (= write what somebody says), let in (= when something
   has a hole in it that allows water, light, etc. to get into it), let out (e.g. a scream), show off (=
   encourage people to see something because you are proud of it), take after (= resemble).

   U s i n g p a s s i v e s
   The choice between an active and passive sentence allows us to present the same information in
   two different orders. Compare:
   active • The storm damaged the roof.
   This sentence is about the storm, and
   says what it did. [The storm is the
   'agent'.)
   passive • The roof was damaged by the storm.
   This sentence is about the roof, and says what
   happened to it. (The 'agent' goes in a
   prepositional phrase with by after the verb.)
   D Here are some situations where we typically choose a passive rather than an active.

   - • When the agent is not known, is 'people in general', is unimportant, or is obvious, we prefer

   passives. In an active sentence we need to include the agent as subject; using a passive allows us
   to omit the agent by leaving out the prepositional phrase with by:
   О • My office was broken into when I was on holiday, (unknown agent)

   - • • An order form can be found on page 2. (agent = people in general)
   - • These boxes should be handled with care, (unimportant agent)
   - • She is being treated in hospital, (obvious agent; presumably 'doctors')
   - • In factual writing, particularly in describing procedures or processes, we often wish to omit the

   agent, and use passives:

   - • Nuclear waste will still be radioactive even after 20,000 years, so it must be disposed of

   very carefully. It can be stored as a liquid in stainless-steel containers which are encased in
   concrete. The most dangerous nuclear waste can be turned into glass. It is planned to store
   this glass in deep underground mines.

   - • In spoken English we often use a subject such as people, somebody, they, we, or you even when

   we do not know who the agent is. In formal English, particularly writing, we often prefer to
   use a passive. Compare:

   - • They're installing the new computer system next month.
   - • The new computer system is being installed next month, (more formal)

   Notice also that some verbs have corresponding nouns. These nouns can be used as the subject
   of passive sentences, with a new passive verb introduced:

   - • The installation of the new computer system will be completed by next month.
   - • In English we usually prefer to put old information at the beginning of a sentence (or clause)

   and new information at the end. Choosing the passive often allows us to do this. Compare
   these two texts and notice where the old information (in italics) and new information (in bold)
   is placed in the second sentence of each. The second text uses a passive:

   - • The three machines tested for the report contained different types of safety valve. The Boron

   Group in Germany manufactured the machines.

   - • The three machines tested for the report contained different types of safety valve. The

   machines were manufactured by the Boron Group in Germany.

   - • It is often more natural to put agents (subjects) which consist of long expressions at the end of

   a sentence. Using the passive allows us to do this. So, for example:

   - • I was surprised by Don's decision to give up his job and move to Sydney.

   is more natural than 'Don's decision to give up his job and move to Sydney surprised me.'

   these verbs and the verbs in the group above are only possible when the subject and object of the
   active and the subject of the passive are people.
   Some verbs followed by an object+ -ing in the active have no passive:

   We often use a passive to report what people say, think, etc., particularly if we want to avoid
   mentioning who said or thought what we are reporting:

   - • People in the area have been told that they should stay indoors.
   - • Everyone was asked to bring some food to the party.

   A common way of reporting what is said by people in general or by an unspecified group of
   people is to use it + passive verb + that-clause (see Units 44 and 45 for more on that-c\auses):

   - • It is reported that the finance minister is to resign.
   - • It has been acknowledged that underfunding is part of the problem.
   - • It can be seen that prices rose sharply in September.

   Other verbs that can be used in this pattern include agree, allege, announce, assume, calculate,
   claim, consider, decide, declare, discover, estimate, expect, feel, find, know, mention, propose,
   recommend, say, show, suggest, suppose, think, understand.
   «Notice that many other verbs are not used in this pattern, including inform, persuade, reassure,

   - •remind, tell, warn.

   With the verbs agree, decide, forbid, hope, plan, and propose, we can use it + passive verb + to-
   infinitive (notice that some of these are also used in the pattern it + passive verb + that-dause):

   - • It was agreed to postpone the meeting.
   - • It has been decided to build a road around the village.

   В ^
   n a l t e r n a t : i v e t o it + passive verb + that-clause is to use subject + passive verb + to-infinitive:

   - • It was expected that the damage would be extensive, or
   - • The damage was expected to be extensive.
   - • It had been thought that the chemicals convey important information to the brain, or
   - • The chemicals had been thought to convey important information to the brain.

   «Most of the verbs listed in the box in A can also be used in this pattern except for agree,

   - • announce, decide, mention, propose, recommend, suggest.

   We can only use tell in this pattern when it means 'order'. So we can say:

   - • I was told (= ordered) to go with them to the railway station.

   but not 'The accident was told (= said) to have happened just after midnight'.
   When a that-dause begins that + there..., we can make a passive form there + passive verb + to
   be. Compare:

   - • It is thought (that) there are too many obstacles to peace, or
   - • There are thought to be too many obstacles to peace.
   - • In 1981 it was reported (that) there were only two experts on the disease in the country, or
   - • In 1981 there were reported to be only two experts on the disease in the country.
   - • It was alleged (that) there had been a fight, or
   - • There was alleged to have been a fight.,

   Forming questions
   Some questions begin with a wh-word. We can call these wh-questions:

   - • What are you doing tomorrow? • Where have you been?

   Some questions can be answered with 'yes' or 'no'. We can call these yes/no questions.

   - • Have you had to come far? • Did she leave any message?

   QU there is an auxiliary verb (be, do, have, can, will, etc.) we put it in front of the subject:

   - • • Have you ever visited California? • Why are you telling me this now?

   If there is more than one auxiliary verb, we put only the first auxiliary in front of the subject:

   - • Will they be arrested if they refuse to leave? (not Will be they arrested...?)

   We can make questions in a similar way when be is a main verb:

   - • Was she happy when she lived in France? • When is he likely to arrive?

   When we ask yes/no questions with have as the main verb, we usually use Have...got...? or
   Do...have...? Questions such as 'Have you a pen?' are rather formal (see also Unit 27):

   - • Do you have... / Have you got a reservation? (rather than Have you a...?)

   If there is no other auxiliary verb, we make a question by putting do or does (present simple), or
   did (past simple) in front of the subject. A bare infinitive comes after the subject:

   - • Does anyone know where I left my diary? • When did you last see Mary?

   If we use what, which, who or whose as the subject, we don't use do:

   - • What happened to your car? (not What did happen...?)

   Compare:

   - • Who (= subject) did you speak to at the party? and • Who (= object) spoke to you?

   Notice that we can sometimes use do when what, which, who or whose is subject if we want to
   encourage the speaker to give an answer. Do is stressed in spoken English:

   - • Come on, be honest - who did tell you?

   Study how we ask questions about what people think or say using a that-c\ause:

   - • When do you think (that) he will arrive? • What do you suggest (that) I should do next?

   We can ask questions like this with advise, propose, recommend, say, suggest, suppose, think.
   When the w^-word is the subject of the second clause we don't include that:

   - • Who did you say was coming to see me this morning? (not ...say that was coming...?)

   Reporting questions
   When we report a wh-question we use a reporting clause (see Unit 43) followed by a clause
   beginning with a м/^-word. When we report a yes/no question we use a reporting clause
   followed by a clause beginning with either if or whether:

   - • She asked me what the problem was. • Liz wanted to know if/whether I'd seen Tony.

   We usually put the subject before the verb in the wh-, if-, or whether-clause:
   а • 'Have you seen Paul recently?' -• She wanted to know if I had seen Paul recently.

   - •However, if the original question begins what, which, or who followed by be + complement, we

   can put the complement before or after be in the report:

   - • 'Who was the winner?' —> I asked who the winner was. (or ...who was the winner. )

   Notice that we don't use a form of do in the wh-, if-, or wh ether-clause:

   - • She asked me where I (had) found it. (not ...where did I find it./...where I did find it.)

   However, if we are reporting a negative question, we can use a negative form of do:

   - • He asked (me) why I didn't want anything to eat.

   We can sometimes use negative yes/no or wh-questions to make a suggestion, to persuade
   someone, to criticise, or to show that we are surprised, etc.:

   - • Why don't we go out for a meal? (a suggestion)
   - • Wouldn't it be better to go tomorrow instead? (persuading someone)
   - • Can't you play that trumpet somewhere else? (a criticism)
   - • Didn't you tell them who you were? (showing surprise)
   - •'D We usually make a negative yes/no or wh- (particularly why) question with an auxiliary

   verb + -n't before the subject:

   - • Doesn't he want to come with us? • Haven't you got anything better to do?
   - • Why can't we go by bus?
   - • 'I'm not sure I like their new house.' 'What don't you like about it?'

   We can also ask a negative question using a negative statement and a positive 'tag' at the end:

   - • We don't have to leave just yet, do we?

   In more formal speech and writing, or when we want to give some special emphasis to the
   negative (perhaps to show that we are angry, very surprised, or that we want particularly to
   persuade someone), we can put not after the subject:

   - • Did she not realise that she had broken the window?
   - • Can they not remember anything about it? • Why did you not return the money?

   If the question word is the subject, we put -n't or not after the auxiliary verb:

   - • Who wouldn't like to own an expensive sports car? {not Who not would like...?)

   We sometimes use negative words other than not (or -n't) such as never, no, nobody, nothing,
   and nowhere:

   - • Why do you never help me with my homework? (or Why don't you ever help...?)
   - • Have you no money left? (or Don't you have any money left?)
   - • Have you nowhere to go? (or Haven't you got anywhere to go?)

   ('Haven't you any...?' and 'Haven't you anywhere...?' would be formal in the last two examples.]
   Some negative questions anticipate that the answer will be or should be 'Yes':

   - • 'Wasn't Chris in Japan when the earthquake struck?' 'Yes, he was.'
   - • 'Didn't I see you in Paris last week?' 'That's right.'

   Other negative questions anticipate that the answer will be or should be 'No':

   - • 'What's wrong? Don't you eat fish?' 'No, it disagrees with me.'
   - • 'Haven't you finished yet?' 'Sorry, not yet.'

   It is usually clear from the context which kind of answer is anticipated.
   Notice how we answer negative questions:

   - • 'Don't you enjoy helping me?' 'Yes.' (= Yes, I do enjoy it.) or 'No.' (= No, I don't enjoy it.)
   - • 'You're not living here, are you?' 'Yes.' (= Yes, I am living here.) or 'No.' (= No, I'm not

   living here.)
   We can make a suggestion with Why not + verb or Why don't/doesn't...:

   - • Why not decorate the house yourself? (or Why don't you decorate...?)
   - • Why not give her what she wants f (or Why don't we give her...?)

   Why didn't... isn't used to make a suggestion, but can be used to criticise someone:

   - • Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?

   5 'Wouldn't you like another coffee?' ' , that would be lovely.'
   6 'Didn't you tell me that your uncle was an explorer?'' , he was an astronomer.'
   34.4 Make any appropriate suggestion using either Why not + verb or Why don't you.... (E)

   Study these sentences:

   - • Which biscuits did you make - the chocolate ones or the others? (rather than What...?)
   - • I've got orange juice or apple juice. Which would you prefer? (rather than What...?)
   - • He just turned away when I asked him. What do you think he meant? (not Which...?)
   - • What do you want to do this weekend? (not Which...?)

   We usually use which when we are asking about a fixed or limited number of things or people,
   and what when we are not. Often, however, we can use either which or what with little
   difference in meaning. Compare:

   - • What towns do we go through on the way? (the speaker doesn't know the area) and
   - • Which towns do we go through on the way? (the speaker knows the area and the towns in it)

   : D We usually use who to ask a question about people:
   ;

   - • Who will captain the team if Nick isn't available?

   However, we use which when we want to identify a person or people out of a group (for
   example, in a crowded room, or on a photograph) and when we ask about particular classes of
   people. We can use what to ask about a person's job or position:

   - • 'Which is your brother?' 'The one next to Ken.'
   - • Which would you rather be - a doctor or a vet? (or What would...?)
   - • 'What's your sister?' 'She's a computer programmer.'

   We use which, not who or what, in questions before one(s) and of:

   - • Which one of us should tell Jean the news? (ио£ Who one of us...?)
   - • I've decided to buy one of these sweaters. Which one do you think I should choose? (rather

   than What one do you think...?)

   - • Which of these drawings was done by you? (not What of...)
   - • Which of you would like to go first? (not Who of...)

   ffl When we use who or what as a subject, the verb that follows is singular, even if a plural answer
   is expected:
   a • Who wants a cup of coffee? (said to a number of people)

   - • • What is there to do in Leeds over Christmas? (expects an answer giving a number of

   activities)
   Study the use of how and what in these questions:
   What's this one called? (not How...) • What do you think of her work? (not How...)
   What is the blue button for? (= What purpose does it have?) (not How...)
   How about (having) a swim? (= a suggestion) (or What about...)
   What is your brother like? (= asking what kind of person he is) (not How...
   How is your brother? (= asking about health) («of What...
   What was the journey like? (= asking an opinion) (not How.
   How was the journey? (= asking an opinion) (not What...
   What do you like about it? (= asking

   Note: A good dictionary will list
   the meanings of verbs and tell you
   whether each meaning is transitive
   or intransitive or both.
   В
   Some verbs (e.g. see, describe) are followed by an object. These are called transitive verbs.
   «Other verbs that are transitive in their most common meanings include arrest, avoid, do, enjoy,

   - •find, force, get, give, grab, hit, like, pull, report, shock, take, tell, touch, want, warn.

   Some verbs (e.g. arrive, cough) are not followed by an object. These are called intransitive verbs.
   eOther verbs that are intransitive in their most common meanings include appear, come, fall, go,

   - •happen, matter, sleep, swim, wait.

   If a verb can't be followed by an object, it can't be made passive (see Unit 29).
   Some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive. Compare:

   - • I closed the door. and • The door closed.

   ' Verbs like this are often used to talk about some kind of change. Other examples are break,
   burn, empty, increase, open, shut, spoil.
   Some transitive verbs can have their objects left out when the meaning is clear from the context:

   - • He has smoked (cigarettes) since he was 10. • She plays (the saxophone) beautifully.

   Other verbs like this include answer, ask, cook, dance, drink, eat, fail, phone, read, sing, wash,
   win, write.
   After some verbs we typically or always add a completion - a phrase which completes the
   meaning of the verb - which can be an adverb or prepositional phrase. Compare:

   - • He paused for a few moments. or • He paused, (no completion needed)
   - • The disease originated in Britain, (not The disease originated.) (completion needed)

   Some verbs which are typically or always followed by a completion are intransitive in their most
   common meanings:

   - • I'm sure that blue car belongs to Matthew.
   - • We had to contend with hundreds of complaints, (not We had to contend.)

   ' Here are some more examples together with prepositions that commonly begin the completion:
   alternate between, aspire to, care for, culminate in, object to.
   Other verbs which are typically or always followed by a completion are transitive in their most
   common meanings:

   - • I always associate red wine with France. (not I always associate red wine.)
   - • She put the report on the floor. (ио^ She put the report.)

   Here are some more examples together with prepositions that commonly begin the completion:
   base...on, compare...with, interest...in, lend...to, mistake...for, prevent...from, regard...as,
   remind...of, supply...with.

   Sandra is being questioned by a barrister in court.
   BARRISTER: Could you begin by telling what
   happened on the evening of the 26th July.
   SANDRA: Yes, I was walking home from work when I
   saw someone who I thought was my friend, Jo.
   I went up to her and touched on the arm. But
   when the woman turned round it wasn't Jo at all.
   I just said, "I'm sorry, I mistook you."
   BARRISTER: And could you describe in detail.
   SANDRA: Well, to be honest, her face shocked. She reminded of a witch from a children's story -
   a long nose and staring eyes. When I tried to walk, she stood. I couldn't avoid. She grabbed
   and prevented from escaping. I struggled, but she pulled into a car parked nearby. She forced
   to give my purse and she wanted to give my ring, too. But I wasn't going to let her take. So I
   hit with my bag and leapt. Then I just ran. At first I could hear her following, but then she
   disappeared. After that I ran into the town centre and reported to the police. They took a
   statement, and then they drove me and warned to lock my doors and windows. Later that
   night they phoned to say that they had arrested.

   V e r b + t o - i n f i n i t i v e o r b a r e i n f i n i t i v e
   Verb + (object) + to-infinitive
   After some verbs, we need to include an object before a to-infinitive:

   - • I considered her to be the best person for the job.
   - • The police warned everyone to stay inside with their windows closed.

   There are many verbs like this including allow, believe, cause, command, enable, encourage,
   entitle, force, invite, order, persuade, show, teach, tell.
   After some verbs, we can't include an object before a to-infinitive:
   о • The shop refused to accept a cheque.

   - • • He threatened to report their behaviour to the principal, (not He threatened them to report

   their behaviour...)
   Other verbs like this include agree, consent, decide, fail, hope, pretend, start, volunteer.
   After some verbs, an object might or might not be included before a to-infinitive. Compare:

   - • I prefer to drive. (= I do the driving) and • I prefer you to drive. (= you do the driving)
   - • We need to complete this report by Friday. (= we complete it) and
   - • We need them to complete this report by Friday. (= they complete it)

   Other verbs like this include can bear (in negative sentences and in questions), hate, help, like,
   love, want, wish. Notice that after help we can use either a to-infinitive or bare infinitive (see E):

   - • I'll help you (to) arrange the party if you like.

   With some verbs in the pattern verb + object + to-infinitive we have to put the word
   for immediately after the verb:

   - • We waited for the taxi to come before saying goodbye, (not ...waited the taxi to come...)
   - • They arranged for Jane to stay in London, (not ...arranged Jane to stay...)

   Other verbs like this include appeal, apply, campaign, long (= want), plan. After apply and
   campaign, the to-infinitive is usually passive:

   - • They applied for the hearing to be postponed.

   Verb + (object) + bare infinitive
   Some verbs are followed by a bare infinitive after an object:
   a • She noticed him run away from the house, (not ...noticed him to run...)

   - • «I made Peter wait outside, (not ...made Peter to wait...)

   Other verbs like this include feel, hear, observe, overhear, see, watch; have, let. Notice, however,
   that in passive sentences with these verbs, we use a to-infinitive:

   - • He was overheard to say that he hoped John would resign.

   After some of these verbs (feel, hear, notice, observe, overhear, see, watch) we can use either the
   bare infinitive or the -ing form, but usually there is a difference in meaning (see Unit 39F).
   A few verbs can be followed directly by a bare infinitive in fairly idiomatic phrases, including
   hear tell, make believe, and let (it) slip:

   - • He made believe that he had caught the huge fish himself. (= pretended)
   - • She let (it) slip that she's leaving. (= said it unintentionally) s

   Notice also the phrases make do and let go: ('Don't let go!'

   Some verbs are followed by a to-infinitive
   but not -ing: agree, aim, ask, decline,
   demand, fail, hesitate, hope, hurry, manage,
   offer, plan, prepare, refuse, want, wish.
   Some verbs are followed by -ing but not a
   to-infinitive: admit, avoid, consider, delay,
   deny, detest, dread, envisage, feel like, finish,
   imagine, miss, recall, resent, risk, suggest.
   The verbs begin, cease, start, and continue can be followed by either a to-infinitive or an -ing
   form with little difference in meaning:

   - • Even though it was raining, they continued to play / playing.

   However, with these verbs we normally avoid using two -ing forms together, as a repeated
   pattern can sound awkward:

   - • I'm starting to learn Swahili. (rather than I'm starting learning Swahili.)

   The verbs advise and encourage are followed by -ing when there is no object and to-infinitive
   when there is one. Compare:

   - • I'd advise taking more exercise. and • I'd advise you to take more exercise.

   Other verbs can be followed by either a to-infinitive or an -ing form, but there can be a
   difference in meaning. These include come, go on, mean, regret, remember, stop, try.

   Some verbs must have an object before an -ing form:

   - • The police found the man climbing the wall.
   - • She overheard them talking about the

   closure of the factory.
   Other verbs like this include catch, discover,
   feel, hear, leave, notice, observe, see, spot,
   watch
   Notice, however, that this is not the case when these verbs are in the passive:

   - • The man was found climbing the wall.

   D Some verbs can have an object or no object before an -ing form:

   - • They can't stand (him) driving his old car.
   - • I remember (you) buying that jumper.

   Other verbs like this include detest, dislike,
   dread, envisage, hate, imagine, like, love,
   mind (in questions and negatives), miss,
   recall, regret, resent, risk, start, stop
   ; #* ^Some verbs can't have an object before an -ing form:

   - • Despite his injury he continued playing.
   - • I actually enjoy cleaning shoes. It's relaxing!

   Other verbs like this include admit, advise,
   consider, delay, deny, deserve, escape, face,
   finish, forget, propose, put off, suggest
   Some of the verbs in В and С (admit, deny, forget, recall, regret, remember) can be followed by
   having + past participle instead of the -ing form, with little difference in meaning:

   - • He remembered having arrived at the party, but not leaving, (or He remembered arriving...)
   - • I now regret having bought the car. (or I now regret buying...)

   These pairs of sentences have the same meaning:

   - • I resented Tom winning the prize. and • I resented Tom's winning the prize.
   - • Mary recalled him borrowing the book, and • Mary recalled his borrowing the book.

   Other verbs that can be followed by an object with a possessive and then an -ing form include
   verbs of '(dis)liking' such as detest, disapprove of, dislike, hate, like, love, object to, and verbs of
   'thinking' such as envisage, forget, imagine, remember, think of. Notice that we can only use a
   possessive form (Tom's, his) like this to talk about a person or a group of people:

   - • I remembered the horse winning the race, (but not ...the horse's winning...)

   The possessive form in this pattern is usually considered to be rather formal.
   A few verbs (feel, hear, notice, observe, overhear, see, watch) can be followed either by an -ing
   form or a bare infinitive, but the meaning may be slightly different:
   an -ing form
   suggests that the action is repeated or happens
   eover a period of time.

   - • # Did you hear those dogs barking most of the night?

   suggests that we watch, etc. some of the action,
   but not from start to finish

   - • I was able to watch them building the new

   car park from my office window.
   a bare infinitive
   suggests that the action happens only once

   - • I noticed him throw a sweet wrapper on

   the floor, so I asked him to pick it up.
   suggests that we watch, hear, etc. the whole
   action from its start to its finish

   - • I watched him climb through the

   window, and then I called the police.

   A Some verbs can be followed by a clause beginning with a wh-word (how, what, when, where,
   which, who, or why):

   - • That might explain why he's looking unhappy.
   - • Let's consider how we can solve the problem.
   - • I couldn't decide which train I ought to catch.
   - •j^^ Other verbs like this include arrange, calculate, check, choose, debate, determine, discover,

   discuss, establish, find out, forget, guess, imagine, know, learn, notice, plan, realise, remember,
   say, see, talk about, think (about), understand, wonder.
   These verbs can also be followed by a wh-word (except 'why') + to-infinitive:

   - • I don't understand what to do.
   - • She calculated how much to pay on the back of an envelope.

   But notice that if we change the subject in the wh-clause we can't use a to-infinitive:

   - • I can't imagine what you like about jazz, (but not I can't imagine what to...)

   D Some verbs must have an object before the wh-da.use:
   n • She reminded me where I had to leave the papers.

   - • • We told Derek and Linda how to get to our new house.
   - •j/0q Other verbs like this include advise, inform, instruct, teach, warn. The verbs ask and show often

   have an object before a w^-clause, but not always:

   - • I asked (him) how I could get to the station, and he told me.

   These verbs can also be followed by an object + wh-word + to-infinitive:

   - • She taught me how to play chess.
   - • I showed him what to look for when he was buying a second-hand car.

   P ©We can often use the way instead of how:

   - • • Have you noticed the way he spins the ball, [or ...how he spins the ball.)

   n whether
   We can use whether as the wh-word in a ^-clause when we want to indicate that something is
   possible, but that other things are also possible. Whether has a similar meaning to 'if:

   - • He couldn't remember whether he had turned the computer off.
   - • Can you find out whether she's coming to the party or not.

   ^Whether can be followed by a to-infinitive, but 'if is never used before a to-infinitive:

   - • • They have 14 days to decide whether to keep it or send it back.
   - • uf^ Verbs that are often followed by whether + to-infinitive include choose, consider, debate, decide,

   determine, discuss, know, wonder.

   whether and the second has a that-dause (see also Unit 44):

   - • I didn't know that the university was shut, (suggests that the university was shut)

   Have/get something done
   We can use get or have followed by an object + past participle when we want to say that
   somebody arranges for something to be done by someone else:

   - • We had/got the car delivered to the airport. (= it was delivered)
   - • While I was in Singapore I had/got my eyes tested. (= they were tested)

   Got in this pattern is normally only used in conversation and informal writing.
   Notice that the word order is important. Compare:

   - • We had the car delivered to the airport. (Someone else delivered the car) and
   - • We had delivered the car to the airport. (= past perfect; we delivered the car)

   We use have...
   if it is clear that the person referred to in
   the subject of the sentence is not responsible
   for or has no control over what happens:
   n • I had my appendix removed when

   - • I was six.
   - • They had their car broken into again.

   However, in informal speech some
   people use get in sentences like this.
   We use get...
   when we say that the person referred to in
   the subject of the sentence does something
   themselves, causes what happens, perhaps
   accidentally, or is to blame for it:

   - • I'll get the house cleaned if you cook the

   dinner. (= I'll clean the house)

   - • Sue got her fingers trapped in the bicycle

   chain. (= Sue trapped her fingers)
   We prefer have if we want to focus on the result of the action rather than the action itself:

   - • I'll have the house cleaned by the time you get home.
   - • Sue had her fingers trapped in the bike chain for half an hour.

   i
   We use won't (or will not) have, not get, if we want to say that we won't allow something to
   happen to someone or something:

   - • I won't have him spoken to like that.
   - • I won't have my name dragged through the dirt by the press.

   Want something done, etc.
   We use need, prefer, want, and would like followed by an object + past participle to say that we
   need, prefer, etc. something to be done. Notice that we can include to be before the past
   participle form with a similar meaning. After need we can use an object + -ing with the same
   meaning, but we can't use to be with an -ing form:
   Be careful washing those glasses! I don't want them (to be) broken.
   We needed the house (to be) redecorated, (or ...the house redecorating.)

   - • I'd like my car (to be) serviced, please.

   Hear, feel, see, watch
   We can use hear, feel, see and watch followed by an object + past participle to talk about
   hearing, etc. something happen. After feel, the object is often a reflexive pronoun:

   - • I haven't heard the piece played before, and • I felt myself thrown forward.

   Compare:

   - • I heard her called Toni. (passive meaning; = she was called Toni) and
   - • I heard Sue call Toni. (active meaning; = Sue called Toni)

   V e r b + t w o o b j e c t s
   Some verbs are followed by two objects. Usually the first object is a person (or group of people)
   and the second object is a thing:

   - • Can you bring me (= object 1) some milk (= object 2) from the shops?
   - • I made him (= object 1) a cup of coffee. (= object 2)

   With many verbs that can have two objects, we can reverse the order of the objects if we put for
   or to before object 1 (this is then called a prepositional object). Compare:

   - • They built us a new house. and • They built a new house for us.
   - • Can you give me that bandage? and • Can you give that bandage to me?

   We often use this pattern if we want to focus particular attention on the object after for/to. We
   also use it if object 1 is a lot longer than object 2:

   - • Jasmin taught music to a large number of children at the school, {not Jasmin taught a large

   number of children at the school music.)

   - • Judith booked theatre tickets for all the students who were doing her Shakespeare course.

   (not Judith booked all the students who were doing her Shakespeare course theatre tickets.)
   We use for + object with verbs such as book, build, buy, catch, choose, cook, fetch, find, make,
   order, pour, save. We use to + object with verbs such as award, give, hand, lend, offer, owe,
   pass, show, teach, tell, throw.
   play, post,
   g:
   fir
   In With some other verbs we can use either to or for, including bring, leave, pay,
   read, send, sing, take, write. Sometimes there is very little difference in meanin

   - • He played the piece of music to (or for) me.
   - • Can you sing that song again to (or for) us.

   Often, however, there is a difference. Compare:

   - • I took some apples $£, • Ann didn't have time to

   to my sister. ffij Jjf^ take her library books
   back, so I took them for her.
   «A few other verbs that are followed by two objects cannot have their objects reversed with for/to:

   - • • We all envied him his lifestyle, (but not We all envied his lifestyle for/to him.)

   Other verbs like this include allow, ask, cost, deny, forgive, guarantee, permit, refuse.
   Some verbs can only have a second object if this is a prepositional object with to:

   - • They explained the procedure. /
   - • They explained me the procedure. X
   - • They explained the procedure to me. /
   - • The suspect confessed his crime. /
   - • The suspect confessed the police his crime. X
   - • The suspect confessed his crime to the police. /

   r oOther verbs like this include admit, announce, demonstrate, describe, introduce, mention,

   - •point out, prove, report, say, suggest.

   The verbs collect, mend and raise can only have a second object if this is a prepositional object
   with for:

   - • He raised a lot of money for charity, (not He raised charity a lot of money.)

   Quoting
   We often report what people think or what they have said. In writing we may report their actual
   words in a quotation (see also Appendix 2):

   - • 'I suppose you've heard the latest news,' she said.
   - • 'Of course,' Carter replied, 'you'll have to pay him to do the job.'
   - • She asked, 'What shall I do now?'

   The reporting clause ('she said', 'Carter replied', etc.) can come before, within, or at the end of
   the quotation.
   In the English used in stories and novels, the reporting verb (e.g. say, reply, ask) is often placed
   before the subject when the reporting clause comes after the quotation:

   - • 'When will you be back?' asked Arnold, (or ...Arnold asked.)

   However, we don't use this order when the subject is a pronoun:

   - • 'And after that I moved to Italy,' she continued, (not ...continued she.)

   More commonly, especially in speech, we report in our own words what people think or what
   they have said. When we do this we can use sentences that have a reporting clause and a
   reported clause (see also Units 44 to 49):
   reporting clause
   She explained
   He complained
   reported clause
   (that) she couldn't take the job until January,
   (that) he was hungry.
   Negatives in reporting
   To report what somebody didn't say or think, we make the reporting verb negative:

   - • He didn't tell me how he would get to London.

   rtlf we want to report a negative sentence, then we normally report this in the reported clause:

   - • 'You're right, it isn't a good idea.' —* He agreed that it wasn't a good idea.

   However, with some verbs, to report a negative sentence we make the verb in the reporting
   clause negative instead:

   - • 'I'm sure it's not dangerous.' —• She didn't think it was dangerous, (rather than She thought

   it wasn't dangerous.)
   Other verbs like this include believe, expect, feel, intend, plan, propose, suppose, want.
   Reporting using nouns
   We sometimes report people's words and thoughts using a noun in the reporting clause
   followed by a reported that-, to-infinitive-, or tf/7-clause:

   - • The claim is often made that smoking causes heart disease.
   - • The company yesterday carried out its threat to dismiss workers on strike.
   - • John raised the question of how the money would be collected.
   - • Nouns followed by a ffcaf-clause include acknowledgement, advice, announcement, answer,

   a claim, comment, conclusion, decision, explanation, forecast, guarantee, observation, promise,

   - • reply, statement, warning. Notice that we don't usually leave out that in sentences like this.
   - • Nouns followed by a to-infinitive clause include advice, claim, decision, encouragement,

   instruction, invitation, order, promise, recommendation, threat, warning. Notice that some of
   these can also be followed by a that-clause.

   - • Nouns followed by a wh-dause include issue, problem, question. We usually use of after these

   nouns in reporting.
   Reporting questions = Reporting statements = Reporting offers, etc.

   R e p o r t i n g s t a t e m e n t s ( 1 ) : t h a t - c l a u s e s

   When we report statements, we often use a that-c\ause in the reported clause (see Unit 43):

   - • He said (that) he was enjoying his work.
   - • My husband mentioned (that) he'd seen you the other day.
   - • The members of the Security Council warned that further action may be taken.

   After the more common reporting verbs such as agree, mention, notice, promise, say, think, we
   often leave out that, particularly in informal speech. However, it is less likely to be left out after
   less common reporting verbs such as complain, confide, deny, grumble, speculate, warn; and
   also in formal writing; and after the verbs answer, argue, reply. We are also more likely to
   include it if the that-c\a.usz doesn't immediately follow the verb. Compare:

   - • She agreed (that) it would be safer to buy a car than a motorbike, and
   - • She agreed with her parents and brothers that it would be safer to buy a car than a

   motorbike, (rather than ...and brothers it would be safer...)
   Some reporting verbs which are followed by a rfwf-clause have an alternative with an object +
   to-infinitive (often to be), although the alternatives are often rather formal. Compare:

   - • I felt that the results were satisfactory. or • I felt the results to be satisfactory.
   - • They declared that the vote was invalid. or • They declared the vote to be invalid.

   Other verbs like this include acknowledge, assume, believe, consider, expect, find, presume,
   report, think, understand.
   Study the following sentence:

   - • I notified the bank that I had changed my address.

   If we use a that-c\a.use after the verb notify, then we must use an object ('the bank') between the
   verb and the that-c\ause, and this object can't be a prepositional object (see E below). So we
   can't say 'I notified that I ...' or T notified to the bank that I ...'
   Other verbs like this include assure, convince, inform, persuade, reassure, remind, tell.
   With advise, promise, show, teach, and warn, we sometimes put an object before a ^af-clause:

   - • They promised (me) that they would come to the party.
   - • A recent survey has shown (us) that Spain is the favourite destination for British holiday

   makers.
   Study the following sentences:

   - • She admitted (to me) that she was seriously ill.
   - • We agreed (with Susan) that the information should go no further.
   - • I begged (of him) that he should reconsider his decision. (Very formal; less formal would be

   'I begged him to reconsider his decision.')
   After admit, agree and beg we can use a that-c\ax\st with or without an object ('me', 'Susan',
   'him') before the that-c\a.me. However, if we do include an object, we put a preposition before it
   'to', 'with', 'of'). This object is sometimes called a prepositional object.
   Verbs with to + prepositional object: admit, announce, complain, confess, explain, indicate,
   mention, point out, propose, recommend, report, say, suggest
   Verbs with with + prepositional object: agree, argue, check, confirm, disagree, plead
   Verbs with of + prepositional object: ask, beg, demand, require
   Reporting questions: Reporting statements (2) and (3) = Reporting offers, etc.

   c l a u s e s
   The tense we choose for a that-clause is one that is appropriate at the time that we are reporting
   what was said or thought. This means that we sometimes use a different tense in the that-clause
   from the one that was used in the original statement:

   - • 'Tim is much better.' —• She said that Tim was much better.
   - • 'I'm planning to buy a new car.' —• Ian told me that he was planning to buy a new car.
   - • 'I've never worked so hard before.' —> Our decorator remarked that he had never worked so

   hard before.
   See Unit 46 for the choice of tense in the reporting clause.
   When the situation described in the that-clause is a PERMANENT SITUATION, or still exists or is
   relevant at the time we are reporting it then we use a present tense (or present perfect) if we also
   use a present tense for the verb in the reporting clause:

   - • Dr Weir thinks that he spends about 5 minutes on a typical consultation with a patient.

   (not ...spent about...)

   - • Australian scientists claim that they have developed a way of producing more accurate

   weather forecasts, (not ...they developed...)

   - • Jill says that Colin has been found safe and well, (not ...had been found...)

   However, when we use a past tense in the reporting clause we can use either a present or past
   tense (or present perfect or past perfect) in the that-clause:

   - • She argued that Carl is/was the best person for the job.
   - • He said that he is/was living in Oslo.
   - • I told Rosa that I don't/didn't like going to parties.
   - • They noted that the rate of inflation has/had slowed down.

   Choosing a present tense (or present perfect) in the that-clause emphasises that the situation
   being reported still exists or is still relevant when we report it.
   If we want to show we are not sure that what we are reporting is necessarily true, or that a
   situation may not still exist now, we prefer a past rather than a present tense:

   - • Sarah told me that she has two houses. (= might suggest that this is the case)
   - • Sarah told me that she had two houses. (= might suggest either that this is perhaps not true,

   or that she once had two houses but doesn't have two houses now)
   When the situation described in the that-clause is in the past when we are reporting it, we use a
   past tense (simple past, past continuous, etc.):

   - • 'I don't want anything to eat.' —* Mark said that he didn't want anything to eat.
   - • 'I'm leaving!' —• Bob announced that he was leaving.
   - • 'The problem is being dealt with by the manager.' —• She told me that the problem was being

   dealt with by the manager.
   When the situation described in the that-clause was already in the past when it was spoken
   about originally, we usually use the past perfect to report it, although the past simple can often
   be used instead:

   - • 'I learnt how to eat with chopsticks when I was in Hong Kong.' -» Mary said that she had

   learnt/learnt how to eat with chopsticks when she was in Hong Kong.

   - • T posted the card yesterday.' -* She reassured me that she had posted/posted the card.
   - • 'I've seen the film before.' -> She told me that she had seen the film before.
   - • 'I've been spending a lot more time with my children.' -» He mentioned that he had been

   spending a lot more time with his children.

   - •h Verb tense in the reporting clause

   When we report something that was said or thought in the past, the verb in the reporting clause
   (see Unit 43 and Unit 45B) is often in a past tense:

   - • Just before her wedding, she revealed that she had been married before.
   - • I explained that my paintings were not for sale.

   However, when we report current news, opinions, etc. we can use a present tense for the verb in
   the reporting clause. In some cases, either a present tense or past tense is possible:

   - • The teacher says that about 10 children need special help with reading, {or ...said...)

   However, we prefer a present rather than a past tense to report information that we have heard,
   but don't know whether it is true or not:
   n • Ben tells me that you're moving back to Greece.

   - • • I hear you're unhappy with your job. (See also Unit 2D.)

   and also to report a general statement about what people say or think, or what is said by some
   authority:

   - • Everyone says that it's quite safe to drink the water here.
   - • Business people all over the country are telling the government that interest rates must be cut.
   - • The law says that no-one under the age of 16 can buy a lottery ticket.

   Other changes in reporting statements
   Remember that when we report speech in a different context from the one in which it was
   originally produced, we often need to change pronouns, references to time and place, and words
   such as this, that, these, as well as verb tense. Here are some examples:

   - • 'I've played before.' -* She told him that she had played before.
   - • 'Jim's arriving later today.' —* She said that Jim was arriving later that day.
   - • 'I was sure I'd left it here.' -» He said that he was sure he'd left it there / on the table.
   - • 'I grew these carrots myself.' —• He told me that he had grown those carrots himself.

   Say and tell
   Say and tell are the verbs most commonly used to report statements. We use an object after tell,
   but not after say:

   - • He told me that he was feeling ill. {not ...told that...)
   - • She said that she would be late for the meeting, {not ...said me that...)

   However, we can use to + object after say, but not after tell:

   - • I said to John that he had to work harder, {not ...told to John...)

   oWe can report what topic was talked about using tell + object + about:

   - • • She told me about her holiday in Finland, {not ...said (me) about...)

   Reporting statements with an -ing clause
   With the verbs admit, deny, mention, and report we can report a statement using an -ing clause:

   - • He denied hearing the police warnings, {or He denied that he (had) heard...)
   - • Toni mentioned meeting Emma at a conference in Spain, (or Toni mentioned that she (had)

   wflEmma...)

   Verb + object + to-infinitive clause
   When we report offers, orders, intentions, promises, requests, etc., we can use a to-infinitive
   clause after the reporting clause. Some verbs are followed by an object + to-infinitive clause.
   The object usually refers to the person who the offer, etc., is made to:

   - • 'You should take the job, Frank.' —> She encouraged Frank to take the job.
   - • 'It must be a peaceful demonstration.' —• Dr Barker called on the crowds to demonstrate

   peacefully.
   InOther verbs like this include advise, ask, command, compel, expect, instruct, invite, order,

   - •persuade, recommend, remind, request, tell, urge, warn.

   Verb + to-infinitive clause
   Some verbs cannot be followed by an object before a to-infinitive clause:

   - • 'I'll take you to town.' —> She offered to take me to town, (not She offered me to take...)
   - • 'The theatre will be built next to the town hall.' —> They propose to build the theatre next to

   the town hall, (not They propose them to build...)
   Other verbs like this include agree, demand, guarantee, hope, promise, swear, threaten,
   volunteer, vow.
   oAsk is used without an object when we ask someone's permission to allow us to do something:

   - • • I asked to see his identification before I let him into the house.

   Verb + that-clause or verb + to-infinitive clause
   After some verbs we can use a that-c\a\xse instead of a to-infinitive clause:

   - • He claimed to be innocent. or
   - • He claimed that he was innocent.

   Verbs like this include agree, demand, expect, guarantee, hope, promise, propose, request, vow.
   (See also Unit 48.)
   Verb + that-clause (notverb + to-infinitive clause)
   After verbs such as advise, insist, order, say and suggest we use a that-clause but not a to-
   infinitive clause. Notice that advise and order can be used with object + to-infinitive clause:

   - • The team captain said that I had to play in goal, (not ...said to play...)
   - • There were cheers when he suggested that we went home early, (not ...suggested to go...)

   However, notice that in informal spoken English we can use say with a to-infinitive clause:

   - • Tim said to put the box on the table.

   Verb + to-infinitive clause (/?ofverb + Maf-clause)
   After some verbs we use a to-infinitive but not a that-c\z\xst:

   - • Carolyn intends to return to Dublin after a year in Canada, (not ...intends that...)

   Other verbs like this include long, offer, plan, refuse, volunteer.
   When we report what someone has suggested doing, either what they should do themselves,
   or what someone else should do, we use a reporting clause with advise, propose, recommend, or

   - • The lecturer recommended reading a number of books before the exam.

   We can sometimes report advice, orders, requests, suggestions, etc. about things that need to be
   done or are desirable using a that-dause with should + bare infinitive:

   - • They have proposed that Jim should move to their London office.
   - • Alice thinks that we should avoid driving through the centre of town.
   - • I suggested that Mr Clarke should begin to look for another job.
   - • It has been agreed that the company should not raise its prices.

   After should we often use be + past participle or be + adjective:

   - • They directed that the building should be pulled down.
   - • The report recommends that the land should not be sold.
   - • We urged that the students should be told immediately.
   - • We insist that the money should be available to all students in financial difficulties.

   In formal contexts, particularly in written English, we can often leave out should but keep the
   infinitive. An infinitive used in this way is sometimes called the subjunctive.

   - • They directed that the building be pulled down.
   - • We insist that the money be available to all students in financial difficulties.
   - • It was agreed that the company not raise its prices.

   In less formal contexts we can use ordinary tenses instead of the subjunctive. Compare:

   - • They recommended that he should give up writing.
   - • They recommended that he give up writing, (more formal)
   - • They recommended that he gives up writing, (less formal)

   Notice also:

   - • They recommended that he gave up writing. (= he gave it up)

   Other verbs that are used in a reporting clause before a that-dause with should or the
   subjunctive include advise, ask, beg, command, demand, instruct, intend, order, request, require,
   stipulate, warn. Notice that we can also use that-dauses with should after reporting clauses with
   nouns related to these verbs:

   - • The police gave an order that all weapons (should) be handed in immediately.
   - • The weather forecast gave a warning that people (should) be prepared for heavy snow.

   We can use should in a that-dause when we talk about our own reaction to something we
   are reporting, particularly after be + adjective (e.g. amazed, anxious, concerned, disappointed,
   surprised, upset):

   - • I am concerned that she should think I stole the money. or
   - • I am concerned that she thinks I stole the money, (not ...that she think I stole...)

   Notice that when we leave out should in sentences like this we use an ordinary tense, not an
   infinitive. There is usually very little difference in meaning between sentences like this with and
   without should. We leave out should in less formal contexts.
   We can also use should or sometimes the subjunctive in a that-dause after it + be + adjective
   such as crucial, essential, imperative, important, (in)appropriate, (un)necessary, vital:

   - • It is inappropriate they (should) be given the award again, (or ...they are given...)
   - • It is important that she (should) understand what her decision means, (or ...she

   understands...)

   When there is a modal verb in the original statement, suggestion, etc., this sometimes changes
   when we report what was said. The changes discussed in Unit 49 are summarised in this table:
   modal verb in original
   could, would, should,
   might, ought to, used to
   will, can, may
   shall
   must (= necessary)
   must (= conclude)
   mustn't
   modal verb in report
   could, would, should,
   might, ought to, used to
   would, could, might
   will, can, may (existing or future situations and present tense
   verb in reporting clause)
   will or would, can or could, may or might (existing or future
   situations and past tense verb in reporting clause)
   would, should (offers, suggestions, etc.)
   must or had to
   had to
   mustn't
   I
   We sometimes use a modal verb in a report when there is no modal verb in the original:

   - • 'You're not allowed to smoke here.' -* She told me that I mustn't smoke there.

   The verbs could, would, should, might, ought to, and used to don't change in the report:

   - • 'I could meet you at the airport.' -* He said that he could meet us at the airport.
   - • 'We might drop in if we have time.' —• They said they might drop in if they have time.

   Will usually changes to would, can to could, and may to might. However, if the situation we are
   reporting still exists or is still in the future and the verb in the reporting clause is in a present
   tense, we prefer will, can, and may in the reported clause (see Unit 43). Compare:

   - • 'Careful! You'll fall through the ice!' —> I warned him he would fall through the ice. and
   - • 'I'll be in Paris at Christmas.' —> She tells me she'll be in Paris at Christmas.

   If the situation we are reporting still exists or is still in the future and the verb in the reporting
   clause is in a past tense, then we can use either would or will, can or could, and may or might in
   the reported clause:

   - • 'The problem can be solved.' —• They said the problem can/could be solved.

   When shall is used in the original to talk about the future, we use would in the report:

   - • T shall (I'll) call you on Monday.' —> She told me she would call me on Monday.

   However, when shall is used in offers, requests for advice and confirmation, etc. then we can use
   should in the report, but not shall (see also Unit 25C):

   - • 'Where shall I put this box?' -> He asked where he should put the box.

   When must is used in the original to say that it is necessary to do something, we can usually use
   either must or had to in the report, although must is less common:

   - • 'You must be home by 9 o'clock.' -» She said I must / had to be home by 9 o'clock.

   However, when must is used in the original to conclude that something (has) happened or that
   something is true, then we use must, not had to, in the report (see also Unit 23):

   - • 'I keep forgetting things. I must be getting old.' -* Neil said he must be getting old.

   If mustn't is used in the original, we can use mustn't in the report but not didn't have to:

   - • 'You mustn't tell my brother.' —• He warned me that I mustn't tell his brother.

   Nouns can be either countable or uncountable. Countable nouns are those which can have the
   word a/an before them or be used in the plural. Uncountable nouns are not used with a/an or in
   the plural. This sentence includes countable nouns in bold:

   - • We've got three children, two cats, and a dog.

   This sentence includes uncountable nouns in bold:

   - • It was good to get out into the countryside and breathe in some fresh air.

   Some nouns in English are normally uncountable; in many other languages they are countable:

   photography, poetry, pollution, produce, progress, publicity, research, rubbish, safety, scenery,
   shopping, sightseeing, sunshine, transport, underwear, violence, weather, work.
   Sometimes a noun is used uncountably when we are talking about the whole substance or idea,
   but countably when we are talking about

   - • recognised containers for things. Compare:
   - • I prefer tea to coffee. and • Three teas (= cups of tea), please.
   - • a type, brand or make of thing. Compare:
   - • There's cheese in the fridge. and • There were dozens of cheeses (= kinds of cheese) to

   If a sentence has a singular subject it is followed by a singular verb, and if it has a plural subject
   it is followed by a plural verb; that is, the verb agrees with the subject. Compare:

   - • She lives in China. and • More people live in Asia than in any other continent.

   When the subject of the sentence is complex the following verb must agree with the main noun
   in the subject. In the examples below the subject is underlined and the main noun is circled.
   Notice how the verb, in italics, agrees with the main noun:

   - • Many leadingCfnemEersX)f the opposition party have tried to justify the decision.
   - • The onl<excuie)that he gave for his actions was that he was tired.

   Some nouns with a singular form can be treated either as singular (with a singular verb) or
   plural (with a plural verb):

   - • The council has (or have) postponed a decision on the new road.

   Other words like this include association, audience, class, club, college, committee, community,
   company, crowd, department, electorate, enemy, family, firm, generation, government, group,
   jury, orchestra, population, press, public, school, staff, team, university, and the names of
   specific organisations such as the Bank of England, the BBC, IBM, Sony. We use a singular verb
   if we see the institution or organisation as a whole unit, and a plural verb if we see it as a
   collection of individuals. Often you can use either with very little difference in meaning,
   although in formal writing (such as academic writing) it is more common to use a singular verb.
   In some contexts a plural form of the verb is needed. We would say:

   - • The committee usually raise their hands to vote 'Yes', (not ...raises its hands...)

   as this is something that the individuals do, not the committee as a whole. In others, a singular
   form is preferred. We would say:

   - • The school is to close next year, (not The school are...)

   as we are talking about something which happens to the school as a building or institution, not
   to the individuals that comprise it.
   Some nouns are usually plural and take a plural verb. These include belongings, clothes,
   congratulations, earnings, goods, outskirts, particulars (= information), premises (= building),
   riches, savings, stairs, surroundings, thanks:

   - • The company's earnings have increased for the last five years.

   The nouns police and people also always have a plural verb. The noun whereabouts can be used
   with either a singular or plural verb.
   Some nouns always end in -s and look as if they are plural, but when we use them as the subject
   of a sentence they have a singular verb (see also Unit 52C):

   - • The news from the Middle East seems very encouraging.

   Other words like this include means (= 'method' or 'money'); some academic disciplines, e.g.
   economics, linguistics, mathematics, phonetics, politics, statistics, physics; some sports, e.g.
   gymnastics, athletics; and some diseases, e.g. diabetes, measles, rabies. However, compare:

   uncountable noun we use a singular verb.
   With each and every and a singular noun we
   use a singular verb. (For each of, see above.)
   With everyone, everybody, everything (and
   similar words beginning any-, some- and
   no-) we use a singular verb.

   - • I don't think any of them knows (or

   know) where the money is hidden.

   - • Neither of the French athletes has (or

   have) won this year.

   - • A number of refugees have been turned

   back at the border.

   - • The number of books in the library has

   risen to over five million.

   - • All the furniture was destroyed in the

   fire.

   - • Every room has its own bathroom, but
   - • The boys have each drawn a picture.
   - • Practically everyone thinks that Judith

   should be given the job.
   D Some phrases with a plural form are thought of as a single thing and have a singular verb. These
   include phrases referring to measurements, amounts and quantities:
   O • About three metres separates the runners in first and second places.

   - • • The fifty pounds he gave me was soon spent.

   When a subject has two or more items joined by and, we usually use a plural verb:

   - • Jean and David are moving back to Australia.

   However, phrases connected by and can also be followed by singular verbs if we think of them as
   making up a single item:

   - • Meat pie and peas is Tom's favourite at the moment, (or Meat pie and peas are...)

   Other phrases like this include fish and chips, and research and development (or R and D).
   When a subject is made up of two or more items joined by (either) ...or... or (neither) ...nor... we
   use a singular verb if the last item is singular (although a plural verb is sometimes used in informal
   English), and a plural verb if it is plural:

   - • Either the station or the cinema is a good place to meet, (or ...are... in informal English)
   - • Neither the President nor his representatives are to attend the meeting.

   If the last item is singular and the previous item plural, we can use a singular or plural verb:

   - • Either the teachers or the principal is (or are) to blame for the accident.

   After per cent (also percent or %) we use a singular verb:

   - • An inflation rate of only 2 per cent makes a big difference to exports.
   - • Around 10 per cent of the forest is destroyed each year.

   However, in phrases where we can use of + plural noun we use a plural verb:

   - • I would say that about 50 per cent of the houses need major repairs.
   - • Of those interviewed, only 20 per cent (= of people interviewed) admit to smoking.

   But where we use a singular noun that can be thought of either as a whole unit or a collection of
   individuals, we can use a singular or plural verb (see also Unit 51B):

   - • Some 80 per cent of the electorate is expected to vote, (or ...are expected...)

   5 2
   The new premises we plan to occupy in Camford are now being
   built. The outskirts of this city is an ideal site for a company like
   ours. R and D are an important part of our work, and next year fifty
   per cent of our budget are to be spent on our Camford centre. Some
   of our staff in the US are being asked to relocate, and eventually
   around ten per cent of our US workforce are to move to Britain.
   However, the majority of our new employees is to be recruited
   locally, and we think that the local community are going to benefit
   enormously from this development. A number of business leaders
   and the local Member of Parliament is being invited to a meeting
   next week. Unfortunately, neither the Company President nor the
   Managing Director of Macroworth is available to address that
   meeting, but I and other senior managers am to attend.

   To make the possessive form of nouns in writing, we add 's ('apostrophe s') to singular nouns
   and to irregular plurals that don't end in -s:

   - • Philip's car; the college's administrators; the women's liberation movement

   and add ' (an apostrophe) to regular plurals:

   - • the boys' football boots; the companies' difficulties.

   We can use the possessive form of nouns with people or groups of people (e.g. companies),
   other living things, places, and times. To make the possessive form of names ending in
   -s (pronounced /z/) we can add either ' or 's:

   - • It's Derek Jones' (or Derek Jones's) new sports car.

   Sometimes we add 's to the last word of a noun phrase, which may not be a noun:

   - • She's the boy on the left's sister.

   We can say:

   - • That old car of Jo's is unsafe, and • A novel of Jim Kerr's has been made into a film.

   «When we are talking about relationships between people we can also use a noun without's:

   - • • An uncle of Mark's, (or An uncle of Mark.)

   The noun following a possessive form can be left out when we talk about someone's home or
   some shops and services (e.g. the newsagent's, the chemist's, the hairdresser's):

   - • We're going to Linda's for the evening. (= Linda's home)
   - • I must go to the butcher's this morning. (= the butcher's shop) (Notice that in cases like this

   we can also use the singular without's: I must go to the butcher this morning.)
   We also usually leave out the noun when the meaning is clear in cases like:

   - • 'Whose hat is this?' 'Richard's.' (rather than Richard's hat.)

   Often we can use the possessive 's or of + noun with very little difference in meaning:

   - • Ireland's beauty or • the beauty of Ireland
   - • the company's policy or • the policy of the company

   However, sometimes we prefer to use the possessive form or the of form. In general, we are
   more likely to use the possessive 's form of a noun:

   - • when the noun refers to a particular person or group of people:
   - • Carolyn's illness [rather than the illness of Carolyn)
   - • the children's coats (rather than the coats of the children)
   - • when we are talking about time, as in:
   - • next year's holiday prices (rather than the holiday prices of next year)

   a • last night's TV programmes (rather than the TV programmes of last night)

   - • Notice that we can say: • We had two weeks' holiday in Spain, or We had a two-week holiday.

   In general, we are more likely to use the of + noun form:

   - • with an inanimate noun, i.e. referring to something that is not living:
   - • the cover of the book (or the book cover) (rather than the book's cover)
   - • the construction of the office block (rather than the office block's construction)
   - • when we are talking about a process, or a change over time:
   - • the establishment of the committee (rather than the committee's establishment)
   - • the destruction of the forest (rather than the forest's destruction)
   - • when the noun is a long noun phrase:
   - • She is the sister of someone I used to go to school with, (rather than She is someone I used to

   go to school with's sister.)

   C o m p o u n d n o u n s ( 1 )
   When we want to give more specific information about someone or something, we sometimes
   use a noun in front of another noun. For example, we can use a noun + noun combination to
   say what something is made of, where something is, when something happens, or what someone
   does:

   - • rice pudding a glasshouse the kitchen cupboard hill fog a night flight

   a morning call a language teacher a window-cleaner
   When a particular combination is regularly used to make a new noun, it is called a COMPOUND
   NOUN. We sometimes make compound nouns which consist of more than two nouns:

   - • a milk chocolate bar an air-traffic controller a dinner-party conversation

   Some compound nouns are usually written as one word (e.g. a tablecloth), some as separate
   words (e.g. waste paper), and others with a hyphen (e.g. a word-processor). Some compound
   nouns can be written in more than one of these ways (e.g. a golf course or a golf-course).
   A good dictionary will tell you how a particular compound noun is usually written.
   Even if the first noun has a plural meaning, it usually has a singular form:

   - • an address book (= a book for addresses; not an addresses book)

   a car park (= a place for parking cars; not a cars park)
   However, there are a number of exceptions. These include:

   - • nouns that are only used in the plural, or have a different meaning in singular/plural or

   countable/uncountable:

   - • a clothes shop (compare a shoe shop)

   a customs officer the arms trade

   - • cases such as
   - • the building materials industry the publications department

   when we refer to an institution of some kind (an industry, department, etc.) which deals with
   more than one item or activity (building materials, publications). Compare:

   - • the appointment board (= the board which deals with a particular appointment)

   the appointments board (= the board which deals with all appointments)
   To make a compound noun plural we usually make the second noun plural:

   - • coalmine(s) office-worker(s) tea leaf / tea leaves

   ^However, in compound nouns that consists of two nouns joined by of or in, we make a plural
   *form by making the first noun plural:

   - • bird(s) of prey rule(s) of thumb commander(s)-in-chief

   a darts match a glasses case (= for spectacles)
   a communications network a savings account
   Notice that we say:

   - • a ten-minute speech

   but we can say:

   - • a two-third {or two-thirds) majority

   a 60-piece orchestra a five-year-old child
   a five-time (or five-times) winner
   Some compound nouns consist of -ing + noun. (This -ing form is sometimes called a 'gerund',
   'verbal noun', or '-ing noun'.) The -ing form usually says what function the following noun has:

   - • a living room drinking water (a pack of) playing cards chewing gum

   a dressing gown a turning-point a working party
   Other compound nouns consist of a noun + -ing:

   - • fly-fishing film-making sunbathing risk-taking life-saving

   Sometimes a noun + noun is not appropriate and instead we use noun + 's + noun (possessive
   form) (see Unit 53) or noun + preposition + noun. In general, we prefer noun + 's + noun:

   - • when the first noun is the user (a person or animal) or users of the item in the second noun:
   - • a baby's bedroom a lion's den a women's clinic
   - • when the item in the second noun is produced by the thing (often an animal) in the first:
   - • goat's cheese duck's eggs cow's milk

   (Compare lamb chops, chicken drumsticks (= the lower part of a chicken's leg) when the
   animal is killed to produce the item referred to in the second noun.)

   - • when we talk about parts of people or animals; but we usually use noun + noun to talk about

   parts of things. Compare:

   - • a woman's face a boy's arm a whale's tail a giraffe's neck

   a pen top a computer keyboard the window frame
   We prefer noun + preposition + noun:

   - • when we talk about some kind of container together with its contents. Compare:
   - • a cup of tea (= a cup with tea in it) and • a tea cup (= a cup for drinking tea from)
   - • a box of matches (= a box with matches in) and • a matchbox (= a box made to put

   matches in)

   - • when the combination of nouns does not necessarily refer to a well-known class of items.

   Compare:

   - • a grammar book (a well-known class of books) but
   - • a book about cats (rather than 'a cat book')
   - • income tax (a recognised class of tax) but
   - • a tax on children's clothes (rather than 'a children's clothes tax')

   Some compound nouns are made up of nouns and prepositions or adverbs, and related to two-
   and three-word verbs (see Unit 114). Compare:

   - • Mansen broke out of the prison by dressing as a woman. (= escaped) and

   There was a major break-out from the prison last night. (= prisoners escaped)

   - • Everyone has put in a lot of effort to make the course successful, and

   Universities in Germany and Denmark will have an input into the project.

   - • I lay down on the sofa and was soon asleep, and

   You look tired. Why don't you go and have a lie-down.
   a Countable compound nouns related to two- and three-word verbs have a plural form ending in -s:

   - • • read-out(s) push-up(s) intake(s) outcome(s)

   However, there are exceptions. For example:

   - • looker(s)-on (or onlooker(s)) runner(s)-up passer(s)-by hanger(s)-on

   We can form other kinds of hyphenated phrases that are placed before nouns to say more
   precisely what the noun refers to:

   - • a state-of-the-art (= very modern) computer day-to-day (= regular) control

   a head-in-the-sand attitude (= refusing to think about unpleasant facts)

   A / a n a n d o n e
   I We use a before words that begin with a consonant sound. Some words start with a vowel letter
   but begin with a consonant sound, so we use a before these words, too:

   - • a university (lo ju:n.../) a European (/a juar.../) a one-parent family (/a WAII.../)

   We use an before words that begin with a vowel sound:

   - • an orange an Italian an umbrella

   These include words that begin with a silent letter 'h':

   - • an hour an honest child

   an honour an heir (= a person who inherits money etc., when someone dies)
   rtand abbreviations said as individual letters that begin with A, E, F, H, I, L, M, N, O, R, S or X:

   - • • an MP (Ion em pi:/) an FBI agent (/an ef bi: ai.../) an IOU (/an ai ao jo:/)

   But compare abbreviations said as words:

   - • a NATO general (lo neitau.../) a FIFA official (/a fi:fa.../)

   D We can use a/an before singular countable nouns (see also Unit 50).
   Sometimes we can use either a/an or one:

   - • We'll be in Australia for one (or a) year.
   - • Wait here for one (or a) minute, and I'll be with you.
   - • She scored one (or a) hundred and eighty points.

   Using one in sentences like these gives a little more emphasis to the number.
   However, we use one rather than a/an if we want to emphasise that we are talking about only
   one thing or person rather than two or more:

   - • Do you want one sandwich or two?
   - • Are you staying just one night?
   - • I just took one look at her and she started crying.

   We use one, not a/an in the pattern one...other / another:

   - • Close one eye, and then the other.
   - • Bees carry pollen from one plant to another.

   We also use one in phrases such as one day, one evening, one spring, etc., to mean a particular,
   but unspecified day, evening, spring, etc.:

   - • Hope to see you again one day. • One evening, while he was working late at the office ...

   ' We don't use one when we mean 'any one of a particular type of thing':

   - • I really need a cup of coffee, (not... one cup of coffee.)
   - • You can never find a paper clip in this office, (not ...one paper clip)

   fy • three times a year half an hour a quarter of an hour a day or so (= about a day)

   - • • 50 pence a (= each) litre (notice we can also say '...for one litre')
   - • a week or two (= somewhere between one and two weeks; notice we can also say 'one or

   two weeks')

   - • a few a little a huge number of...

   We use a rather than one in the pattern a...of... with possessives, as in:

   - • She's a colleague of mine.
   - • That's a friend of Bill's.

   We use a/an with a singular noun when we describe someone or something or to say what type
   of thing someone or something is:

   - • English has become an international language.
   - • Sydney is a beautiful city.

   But if we say that someone or something is unique - that there is only one, or that it is the only
   one of its kind - we use the (or sometimes zero article, i.e. no article), but not a/an:

   - • English has become the international language of business.
   - • Sydney is the capital city of New South Wales.

   We use a/an to say what a person's job is, was, or will be:

   - • She was a company director when she retired.
   - • Against her parents' wishes, she wants to be a journalist.

   However, when we give a person's job title, or their unique position, we use the or zero article,
   not a/an. Compare:

   - • She's been appointed (the) head of the company, and
   - • I'm a production manager at Fino. (= there may be more than one production manager)

   After the position of, the post of, or the role of we use zero article before a job title:

   - • Dr Simons has taken on the position of Head of Department.

   We use the before a superlative adjective (the biggest, the most expensive, etc.) when the
   superlative adjective is followed by a noun or defining phrase:

   - • He is the finest young player around at the moment.
   - • This painting's the most unusual in the collection.

   However, we can often leave out the, particularly in an informal style, when there is no noun or
   defining phrase after the superlative adjective.

   - • A: Why did you decide to stay in this hotel?

   B: It was (the) cheapest. / It was the cheapest I could find.
   When most before an adjective means 'very' or 'extremely' we can use a (with countable
   singulars) or zero article (with plurals and uncountables) - rather than the - when there is no
   following noun. Most is used in this way particularly in a rather formal spoken style. In
   everyday conversation we generally use a word such as 'very' instead:

   - • He was a most peculiar-looking man. (= a very peculiar-looking man)
   - • It was most expensive petrol. (= extremely expensive)

   We use the when we know that there is only one of a particular thing. For example:

   - • the sun the world the North Pole the jet age the international market

   the travel industry the arms trade
   The same applies to the following things when we refer to them in a general way:

   - • the weather the climate the human race the atmosphere the sea the public

   the environment the sky the ground the wind the future the past
   However, if we want to describe a particular instance of these we use a/an. Compare:

   - • She could hear the wind whistling through the trees outside, and
   - • There's a cold wind blowing from the north.
   - • What are your plans for the future? and
   - • She dreamt of a future where she could spend more time painting.

   T h e a n d a / a n ( 2 ) : ' t h i n g s a l r e a d y k n o w n ' , e t c .
   We use the when we expect the listener or reader to be able to identify the thing or person we
   are talking about, and we use a/an when we don't. Compare these pairs of sentences:

   - • Helen's just bought a house in Wilson Street, and
   - • Helen's just bought the house in Wilson Street. (= the house for sale we have previously

   talked about)

   - • A Korean student in our class has had to go home, and
   - • The Korean student has had to go home. (= the Korean student we have previously talked

   about)

   - • There's a bus coming, and
   - • The bus is coming. (= it's the bus we are waiting for)
   - • There's a woman from the bank on the phone, and
   - • He's in a meeting with the woman from the bank. (= you know which woman I mean)

   r D We also use the when it is clear from the situation which person or thing we mean:

   - • What do you think of the table? (= the table we are looking at)
   - • This tastes lovely. What's in the sauce? (= the sauce here on my plate)
   - • The tree looks beautiful now that it's spring. (= the tree here in the garden)

   Study these examples:

   - • Dorothy took a cake and an apple pie to the party, but only the apple pie was eaten.

   We say 'an apple pie' when we first mention it, and 'the apple pie' after that, when the listener
   or reader knows which apple pie we mean.
   a • There was a serious fire in a block of flats in Glasgow last night. The building was totally

   - • destroyed.

   We say 'a block of flats' when we first mention it. We use 'the building' because the listener (or
   reader) will know which building we mean.
   Even if the person or thing hasn't been mentioned before, if the person or thing we mean can be
   understood from what has been said before, we use the:

   - • We had a good time on holiday. The hotel (= the hotel we stayed in) was comfortable, and

   the beach (= the beach we went to) was only ten minutes away.
   Notice that fictional writing (novels, short stories, etc.) will often mention something for the first
   time with the to build up suspense, expectation, etc. For example, a story might begin:

   - • The woman opened the gate and looked thoughtfully at the house.

   The is often used with nouns before a phrase beginning of.... The of... phrase connects this noun
   to a particular thing or person:

   - • Pictures can help students learn the meaning of new words.
   - • The disease could have killed off half the population of the country.
   - • He was woken up by the sound of gunfire.

   Compare these sentences with:

   - • Each new word has a different meaning.
   - • The country has a rapidly expanding population.
   - • He suddenly heard a sound like a gunshot.

   Some nouns are commonly used in the pattern the...of... to refer to a particular place, time, etc.,
   including back, beginning, bottom, end, middle, side, top:

   - • In the middle of his speech he started to cough uncontrollably.

   We use some in affirmative sentences and questions with plural and uncountable nouns when we
   talk about limited, but indefinite or unknown, numbers or quantities of things:

   - • Some furniture arrived for you this morning, (not Furniture arrived...)
   - • Would you like to hear some good news? (not ...to hear good news?)

   When you use it in this way, you pronounce some with its weak form /sam/.
   We also use some to talk about particular, but unspecified, people or things:

   - • Some teachers never seem to get bored with being in the classroom. (= but not all)
   - • I enjoy some modern music. (= but not all)

   When you use it in this way, you pronounce some with its strong form /SAITI/.
   We use zero article with uncountable and plural nouns when we talk generally about people or
   things. Compare the sentences in A above with:

   - • I always like getting good news. (= good news in general)
   - • Furniture is a costly item when you are setting up a home. (= furniture in general)
   - • Teachers like having long holidays. (= all teachers)
   - • I enjoy modern music. (= modern music in general)

   Compare also:

   - • We need food, medicine, and blankets.

   (appeal after earthquake) and

   - • There are some old blankets in the wardrobe.

   Shall I throw them out?

   - • A post office is a place where you can buy stamps, and
   - • I'd like some stamps, please.

   We sometimes use some or zero article with very little difference in meaning:

   - • 'Where were you last week?' 'I was visiting (some) friends.'
   - • Before serving, pour (some) yoghurt over the top.
   - • It'll be cold up in the hills, so bring (some) warm clothes.

   It makes little difference whether we are referring to particular friends (with some) or friends in
   general (with zero article); or whether we are referring to a limited but indefinite amount of
   yoghurt (with some) or yoghurt in general (with zero article).
   Some is used before a number to mean 'approximately':

   - • Some 80% of all those eligible took part in the vote. (= approximately 80%)
   - • There were some 20,000 people at the protest march. (= approximately 20,000)

   When it is used in this way, some is usually pronounced /sAm/.
   When we want to emphasise that we can't say exactly which person or thing we are talking
   about because we don't know or can't remember, we can use some instead of a/an with a
   ^singular noun. When it is used in this way, some is pronounced /SAITI/:

   - • • I was asked a really difficult question by some student in class two.

   We use the phrase some (thing) or other in a similar way:

   - • I bought them from some shop or other in the High Street, (not ...from a shop or other...)

   characteristics of a class of things or people rather than one specific thing or person. In

   - • the late (= dead) Buddy Holly the artist William Turner

   the Aboriginal writer Sally Morgan the wonderful actor Harrison Ford

   - • when we talk about a family as a whole:
   - • The Robinsons are away this weekend. (= the Robinson family)

   Notice that a/an, or sometimes zero article, is used with a name to mean that someone else has
   or does not have the particular excellent qualities of the person named:

   - • Jane plays tennis well, but she'll never be (a) Steffi Graf.

   We can also refer to a painting by a famous artist as, for example, 'a Van Gogh'.
   You can use a/an before a person's name if you don't know the person yourself. Compare:

   - • There's a Dr Kenneth Perch on the phone. (= I haven't heard of him before) Do you want to

   talk to him?

   - • Dr Perch is here for you. (= I know Dr Perch)

   our street.
   ^ We use zero article when we talk about institutions such as hospital, university, prison, school,
   * college, or church being used for their intended purpose: medical treatment in hospital, studying
   in university, and so on. We use articles when we talk about them as particular places or
   buildings. Notice that we talk about bed in the same way. Compare:

   - • She usually stays in bed till late at the weekend, and
   - • 'Have you seen my socks?' 'You left them on the bed.'

   When we talk about cinema, opera or theatre in general, or when we refer to a building where
   this type of entertainment takes place, we use the:

   - • I try to go to the cinema at least once a week. (= cinema in general)
   - • We usually go to the cinema in New Street. (= a specific cinema)

   However, if we are talking about a form of art, we generally prefer zero article:

   - • Not many children enjoy opera, (rather than ...enjoy the opera.)

   We often use zero article with the names of holidays, special times of the year, or with the names
   of months and days of the week:

   - • Easter Ramadan New Year's Day September Monday

   But compare:

   - • I'll see you on Saturday.
   - • We met on Saturday.

   = next Saturday /
   last Saturday

   - • They arrived on a

   Saturday as far as I can

   the day of the week, not
   which particular Saturday

   - • They arrived on the

   Saturday after my
   birthday party.
   = a particular Saturday,
   specifying which one
   With winter, summer, spring, autumn, and New Year (meaning the holiday period), we can
   often use either the or zero article:

   - • In (the) summer I try to spend as much time in the garden as I can.
   - • In Scotland, they really know how to celebrate (the) New Year.

   We use the when it is understood which summer, spring, etc. we mean:

   - • 'When did you meet Beth?' 'In the summer.' (= last summer)
   - • 'When are you going to university?' 'In the autumn.' (= next autumn)
   - • I first went skiing in the spring of 1992.

   We say 'in the New Year' to mean at or near the beginning of next year:

   - • I'll see you again in the New Year.

   When we want to describe the features of a particular holiday, season, etc., we use a/an:

   - • That was a winter I'll never forget.

   D We use the and a/an in the usual way when we talk about the morning/afternoon/evening of a
   particular day:

   - • I woke up with a sore throat, and by the evening my voice had disappeared.
   - • We're going in the afternoon.
   - • 'You look upset.' 'Yes, I've had a terrible morning.'

   However, we use zero article with at night and by night. Compare:

   - • She kept us awake all through the night, and
   - • I don't like driving at night.

   We use zero article with midnight, midday, and noon:

   - • If possible, I'd like it finished by midday.

   We usually use zero article when we talk about meals:

   - • What have we got for dinner?
   - • I don't like drinking coffee at breakfast.

   We wouldn't say, for example, 'I had a/the breakfast before I went out'. However, if we want to
   describe a particular meal, then we can use an article:

   - • We didn't get up until 10 o'clock and had a late breakfast.
   - • The dinner we had at Webster's restaurant was marvellous.

   When we talk about a formal dinner or lunch for a special occasion, we use 'a dinner' or 'a

   impossible, unlikely)

   - • We haven't got any butter left.
   - • It was impossible for any air to get out.
   - • in other questions
   - • Do you have any better ideas?
   - • Has there been any discussion about the

   proposal yet?
   Some and any can also be used to talk about a particular person or thing without mentioning
   them specifically. When some is used in this way it is pronounced /SAITI/:

   - • There must be some way I can contact Jo. (= There must be a way, but I don't know it.)

   anybody), something/anything, and somewhere/anywhere:

   Much (of) and many (of) are used to talk about quantities and amounts. Much (of) is used with
   n uncountable nouns and many (of) with plural nouns (see also Unit 69):

   - • • Many people (= plural noun) eat too much meat (= uncountable noun).

   Much of can also be used with a singular countable noun to mean 'a large part of:

   - • Much of the national park was destroyed in the fire.

   We can use much and many without a noun if the meaning is clear:

   - • Can you get some sugar when you go shopping? There isn't much left.

   Much (of) and many (of) are mainly used...
   ...in negative sentences to emphasise that we
   are talking about small (or smaller than
   expected) quantities or amounts.
   ...in questions to ask about quantities or
   amounts.

   - • He didn't show much interest in what I said.
   - • Not many of my friends knew I was getting

   married.

   - • Have you got much homework to do?
   - • How many questions could you answer?

   In affirmative sentences we often use a lot of, lots of, or plenty of (see C) to talk about large
   amounts and quantities, particularly in conversation and informal writing. Using much (of)
   often sounds a little formal, and many (of) is often very formal or inappropriate:

   - • Lots of her students went on to become teachers. ('Many of is a little more formal)
   - • We had plenty of hotels to choose from, ('many hotels' is more formal)
   - • I've given the problem a lot of thought, ('much thought' is very formal)
   - • John offered me a lot of money for the car. {not much money)

   However, in formal contexts, such as academic writing, much (of) and many (of) are often
   preferred, or phrases such as a great deal of or a large amount/number of:

   - • Much debate has been generated by Thornton's controversial paper.
   - • A great deal of the exhibition was devoted to his recent work, (or Much of...)
   - • A large amount of the food was inedible, (or Much of...)

   In formal contexts we can also use much and many as pronouns:

   - • Much remains to be done before the drug can be used with humans.
   - • Many (= many people) have argued that she is the finest poet of our generation.

   Notice that in both formal and informal contexts we can use much and many in affirmative
   sentences after as, so, and too:

   - • I'd say there were twice as many women at the meeting as men.
   - • She gave me so much spaghetti, I couldn't eat it all.

   We rarely use much and many without a noun at the end of affirmative sentences. Instead we
   use phrases such as a lot or lots:

   - • 'Have you got any small nails?' 'Yes, I've got a lot / lots.' (not ...I've got many.)

   But we can use much and many at the end of affirmative sentences after as, so, and too:

   - • Do you want some of the pudding? I've got too much.

   We often use plenty of instead of a lot of or lots of. However, plenty of means 'enough, or more
   than enough' and is therefore not likely in certain contexts. Compare:

   - • We took lots of food and drink on our walk through the hills, (or ...plenty of...) and
   - • Jim doesn't look well. He's lost a lot of weight, ('plenty of is unlikely here)

   Notice that we don't use plenty without of before a following noun:

   - • We've got plenty of time left, (not We've got plenty time left.)

   A l l ( o f ) , t h e w h o l e ( o f ) , b o t h ( o f )
   I
   Al l and all of
   We use all or all of when we are talking about the total number of things or people in a group,
   or the total amount of something (see also Unit 69):

   - • All (of) my brothers and sisters were at the airport to see me off.
   - • The baby seems to cry all (of) the time.

   To make negative sentences with all we normally use not all, particularly in a formal style:

   - • Not all the seats were taken, (rather than All the seats were not taken.)

   However, in spoken English we sometimes use all...not. We can also use none (of). But notice
   that not all and none (of) have a different meaning. Compare:

   - • Not all my cousins were at the wedding. (= some of them were there) and
   - • None of my cousins were at the wedding. (= not one of them was there)

   Notice where we put all in the following sentences (see also Unit 90):
   We are all going to Athens during the vacation, (rather than We all are going...)
   They have all heard the news already, (rather than They all have heard...)
   All (of) their hard work had been of no use. (not Their all hard work...)
   These are all confidential files, (not These all are... - except in informal spoken English)
   I planted all four (of the) trees when I moved into the house.
   In modern English we don't use all without a noun to mean 'everyone' or 'everything':

   - • Everyone was waiting to hear the results, (not All were waiting...)

   All can mean 'everything' when it is followed by a relative clause:

   - • I don't agree with all that he said. (= everything that he said)

   We can also use all without a noun to mean 'the only thing':

   - • All she wants to do is help.

   All (of) the and the whole (of)
   Before singular countable nouns we usually use the whole (of) rather than all (of) the:

   - • They weren't able to stay for the whole concert, (rather than ....all (of) the concert.)
   - • The whole of the field was flooded, (rather than All (of) the field was flooded.)

   However, in informal speech all (of) the is sometimes used in this way.
   Before plural nouns we can use all (of) or whole, but they have different meanings. Compare:

   - • All (of the) towns had their electricity cut off. (= every town in an area) and
   - • After the storm, whole towns were left without electricity. (= some towns were completely

   affected)
   Both (of) and all (of)
   We use both (of) when we want to talk about two things together. Both (of) and all (of) are used
   in the same places in sentences. Compare the following with sentences in B:

   - • Both (of) the houses have now been sold.
   - • Are both of you (or Are you both) going to the conference?
   - • I went on holiday with both of them (or ...with them both...) last year.
   - • They have both finished their dinner, (rather than They both have finished...)

   We don't usually make negative sentences with both (of). Instead we can use neither (of):

   - • Neither of them knew the answer, (rather than Both of them didn't know the answer.)

   However, in informal speech both (of) is sometimes used in this way.

   We can use each (of) and every with singular countable nouns to mean all things or people in a
   group of two or more (each (of)) or three or more (every) (see also Unit 69):

   - • The programme is on every (or each) weekday morning at 10.00.
   - • Each (or every) ticket costs £35.

   We use a singular verb after each (of) and every:

   - • Following the flood, every building in the area needs major repair work, (not ...need...)

   However, when each follows the noun or pronoun it refers to, the noun and verb are plural:

   - • Every student is tested twice a year. They are each given a hundred questions to do.

   Notice that we use they, their and them to refer back to phrases such as 'each soldier', 'every
   candidate' etc. which do not indicate a specific gender (male or female). Compare:

   - • Each woman complained that she (or they) had been unfairly treated.
   - • Every candidate said that they thought the interview was too long.

   D Often we can use every or each (of) with little difference in meaning. However:
   we use every

   - • with almost, nearly, virtually, etc. that emphasise we are talking about a group as a whole:
   - • Almost every visitor stopped and stared, (not Almost each visitor...)
   - • if we are talking about a large group with an indefinite number of things or people in it:
   - • Before I met Daniel, I thought every small child liked sweets! (rather than ...each...)
   - • Every new car now has to be fitted with seat belts, (rather than ...each...)
   - • with a plural noun when every is followed by a number:
   - • I go to the dentist every six months, (rather than ...each six months.)
   - • in phrases referring to regular or repeated events such as every other (kilometre), every single

   (day), every so often, every few (months), every now and again (= occasionally).

   - • with abstract uncountable nouns such as chance, confidence, hope, reason, and sympathy to

   show a positive attitude to what we are saying. Here every means 'complete' or 'total':

   - • She has every chance of success in her application for the job.

   we use each

   - • if we are thinking about the individual members of the group. Compare:
   - • We greeted each guest as they entered. (Emphasises that we greeted them individually.)
   - • We greeted every guest as they entered. (Means something like 'all the guests'.)
   - • when we are talking about both people or things in a pair:
   - • I only had two suitcases, but each (one) weighed over 20 kilos.

   When we use all (with plural or uncountable nouns) or every (with singular countable nouns) to
   talk about things or people in a group they have a similar meaning:

   - • Have you eaten all the apples? • He ate every apple in the house.

   However, when we use all or every to talk about time, their meaning is usually different:

   - • John stayed all weekend. (= the whole of the weekend)
   - • John stayed every weekend when he was at university. (= without exception)

   D • everyone (or everybody)
   = every person
   anyone(or anybody)
   = any person at all

   - • Everyone knows who took the money.
   - • Tomorrow I'll write to everyone concerned.
   - • I haven't seen anyone all day.
   - • Did you meet anyone you know at the conference?

   All (Of): Each (of) and all (of):

   Study how we use no and none in these sentences:
   no + noun
   none + 'no noun'

   - • She had no shoes on.
   - • No information was given about how the study was conducted.
   - • There's no train until tomorrow.
   - • Have we got any more sugar? There's none in the kitchen.
   - • 'How many children have you got?' 'None.'

   We use no or none (of) instead of not a or not any to emphasise the negative idea in a sentence.
   Compare:

   - • There isn't a key for this door. or • There's no key for this door, (more emphatic)
   - • She didn't give me any help at all. or • She gave me no help at all.
   - • Sorry, there isn't any left. or • Sorry, there's none left.
   - • She didn't have any of the typical symptoms of cholera. or
   - • She had none of the typical symptoms of cholera.

   Notice that we can't use not any in initial position in a clause or sentence:

   - • No force was needed to make them move, (not Not any force was needed...)
   - • None of the children was/were awake, (not Not any of the children...)

   We often prefer no and none of rather than not any or ...n't any in formal written English.
   In a formal or literary style we can use not a in initial
   position in a clause or sentence (notice the word
   order here; see Unit 120):

   - • Not a word would she say about the robbery.
   - • Not a sound came from the classroom.

   After no, we use a singular noun in situations where we would expect one of something, and a
   plural noun where we would expect more than one. Compare:

   - • Since his resignation, the team has had no manager, (rather than ...had no managers.)
   - • I phoned Sarah at home, but there was no answer, (rather than ...were no answers.)
   - • There were no biscuits left, (rather than ...was no biscuit left.)
   - • He seems very lonely at school, and has no friends, (rather than ...no friend.)

   But sometimes we can use either a singular or plural noun with little difference in meaning:

   - • No answer (or answers) could be found.
   - • We want to go to the island but there's no boat (or there are no boats) to take us.

   When we use none of with a plural noun the verb can be either singular or plural, although the
   singular form is usually more formal:

   - • None of the parcels have arrived yet. (or ...has arrived...)

   However, when we use none with an uncountable noun the verb must be singular.
   If we want to give special emphasis to no or none of we can use phrases like no amount of with
   uncountable nouns and not one (of) with singular countable nouns:

   - • She was so seriously ill that no amount of expensive treatment could cure her.
   - • It was clear that no amount of negotiation would bring the employers and workers closer

   together.

   - • Not one member of the History department attended the meeting.
   - • Not one of the hundreds of families affected by the noise wants to move.

   - • There was little work to do, so I

   didn't earn much money.

   - • We decided to abandon our trip as

   we had little money left.
   iWe often use a few and a little in a 'positive' way; for example, to talk about a small amount or
   quantity, to indicate that this is enough, or suggest that it is more than we would expect.
   We often use few and little in a 'negative' way; for example, to suggest that the amount or
   quantity is not enough, is surprisingly low. This use of few and little is often rather formal.
   We can also use few and little with the, her, my, etc. in a similar 'negative' way:

   - • She put her few clothes into a bag, and walked out of the house for ever.
   - • We should use the little time we have available to discuss Jon's proposal.

   :' R
   m speech or informal writing, it is more usual to use not many/much or only a few/little instead
   of few and little, and we often use a bit of in informal speech instead of a little:

   - • I won't be long. I've only got a few things to get. (rather than ...got few things...)
   - • Sorry I haven't finished, I haven't had much time today, (rather than ...I had little time...)
   - • Do you want a bit of chocolate? (rather than ...a little chocolate?)

   In more formal contexts, such as academic writing, we generally prefer few and little:

   - • The results take little account of personal preference, (rather than ...don't take much...)

   Less (than), and fewer (than)
   We use less (than) with uncountable nouns and fewer (than) with plural countable nouns:

   - • You should have mixed less water with the paint.
   - • There seemed to be fewer lorries on the motorway today.

   However, nowadays many people use less rather than fewer with plural countable nouns:

   - • There were less (or fewer) than 20 students at the lecture.

   But some people think that this use is incorrect, especially in formal written English.
   iWhen we talk about a distance or a sum of money we use less, not fewer:
   Barbara said the beach was twenty miles away, but I thought it was less than that.
   Notice that we use less than or fewer than with percentages:

   - • Less (or Fewer) than 40 per cent of the electorate voted in the general election.

   I
   We can use no fewer/less than when a quantity or amount is surprisingly large:

   - • The team has had no fewer than ten managers in just five years, (or ...no less than...)
   - • Profits have increased by no less than 95% in the last year, (not ...no fewer than...)

   A relative clause gives more information about someone or something referred to in a main
   clause. Some relative clauses (defining relative clauses) are used to specify which person or thing
   we mean, or which type of person or thing we mean:

   - • The couple who live next to us have sixteen grandchildren.
   - • Andrew stopped the police car that was driving past.

   Notice that we don't put a comma between the noun and a defining relative clause. Relative
   clauses begin with a relative pronoun: a wh-yvovA (who, which, etc.) or that. However,
   sometimes we omit the wh-word I that and use a zero relative pronoun (see B below):

   - • We went to a restaurant (which/that) Jane had recommended to us.

   We prefer to put a relative clause immediately after or as close as possible to the noun it adds
   information to:
   ^ • The building for sale was the house which had a slate roof and was by the stream.

   - • (rather than The building for sale was the house by the stream which had a slate roof.)

   When we use a defining relative clause, the relative pronoun can be the subject or the object of
   the clause. In the following sentences the relative pronoun is the subject. Notice that the verb
   follows the relative pronoun:

   - • Rockall is an uninhabited island which/that lies north west of mainland Scotland.
   - • We have a friend who/that plays the piano.

   In the following sentences the relative pronoun is the object. Notice that there is a noun (or
   pronoun) between the relative pronoun and the verb in the relative clause. In this case, we can
   use a zero relative pronoun:

   - • He showed me the rocks (which/that) he had brought back from Australia.
   - • That's the man (who/that) I met at Allison's party.

   We can also use whom instead of who as object, although whom is very formal:

   - • She's an actress whom most people think is at the peak of her career.

   We use that as subject after something and anything; words such as all, little, much, and none
   used as nouns; and superlatives. (Which is also used as subject after something and anything, but
   less commonly.) We use that or zero relative pronoun as object after these:

   - • These walls are all that remain of the city, (not ...all which remain...)
   - • She's one of the kindest people (that) I know, (not ...who I know.)
   - • Is there anything (that) I can do to help? (rather than ...anything which I can do...)

   You can't add a subject or object to the relative clause in addition to the relative pronoun:
   ^ • The man who gave me the book was the librarian, (not The man who he gave me...)
   *Notice also that adding a pronoun to the main clause in addition to the relative clause is
   unnecessary, although it is found in speech:

   - • A friend of mine who is a solicitor helped me. (or, in speech A friend of mine who is a

   solicitor - she helped me.)

   Some relative clauses are used to add extra information about a noun, but this information is
   not necessary to explain which person or thing we mean:

   - • Valerie Polkoff, who has died aged 90, escaped from Russia with her family in 1917.
   - • We received an offer of £80, 000 for the house, which we accepted.

   These are sometimes called non-defining relative clauses. We don't use them often in everyday
   speech, but they occur frequently in written English. Notice that we put a comma between the
   Qnoun and a non-defining relative clause, and another comma at the end of this clause if it is not

   - •also the end of a sentence.

   When we use a non-defining relative clause to add information about a person or people:

   - • we use who as the subject of the clause
   - • One of the people arrested

   was Mary Arundel, who
   is a member of the local council.

   - • we use who or whom as the object of the clause,

   although whom is more formal and rarely
   used in spoken English:

   - • Professor Johnson, who(m) I have long admired, is to visit the university next week.

   When we use a non-defining relative clause to add information about a thing or group of things,
   we use which as the subject or object of the clause:

   - • These drugs, which are used to treat stomach ulcers, have been withdrawn from sale.
   - • That Masters course, which I took in 1990, is no longer taught at the college.

   That is sometimes used instead of which, but some people think this is incorrect, so it is
   probably safer not to use it. We also use which to refer to the whole situation talked about in
   the sentence outside the relative clause:

   - • The book won't be published until next year, which is disappointing.
   - • I have to go to hospital on Monday, which means I won't be able to see you.

   We can also use whose in a non-defining relative clause (see also Unit 72):

   - • Neil Adams, whose parents are both teachers, won first prize in the competition.
   - •Notice that we don't use zero relative pronoun in a non-defining relative clause.

   When we want to add information about the whole or a part of a particular number of things or
   people we can use a non-defining relative clause with of which or of whom after words such as
   all, both, each, many, most, neither, none, part, some, a number (one, two, etc.; the first, the
   second, etc.; half, a third, etc.) and superlatives (the best, the biggest, etc.):

   - • The speed of growth of a plant is influenced by a number of factors, most of which we have

   no control over.

   - • The bank was held up by a group of men, three of whom were said to be armed.
   - • The President has made many visits to Japan, the most recent of which began today.

   We can use the following phrases at the beginning of a non-defining relative clause: at which
   point/time, by which point/time, during which time, and in which case:

   - • It might snow this weekend, in which case we won't go to Wales.
   - • The bandages will be taken off a few days after the operation, at which point we will be able

   to judge how effective the treatment has been.

   - • The next Olympics are in three years, by which time Stevens will be 34.

   R e l a t i v e c l a u s e s ( 3 ) : o t h e r r e l a t i v e p r o n o u n s
   whose
   We use a relative clause beginning with whose + noun, particularly in written English, when we
   talk about something belonging to or associated with a person. Compare:

   - • Stevenson is an architect. Her designs have won international praise, and
   - • Stevenson is an architect whose designs have won international praise.
   - • Dr Rowan has had to do all his own typing. His secretary resigned two weeks ago. and
   - • Dr Rowan, whose secretary resigned two weeks ago, has had to all his own typing.

   We can use whose in both defining and non-defining relative clauses (see Units 70 & 71).
   We sometimes use whose when we are talking about things, in particular when we are talking
   about towns or countries, and organisations:
   Sf • The film was made in Botswana, whose wildlife parks are larger than those in Kenya.

   - • • We need to learn from companies whose trading is more healthy than our own.
   - • The newspaper is owned by the Mearson Group, whose chairman is Sir James Bex.

   We can also use whose when we are talking about particular items, although it is often more
   natural in spoken English to avoid sentences like this:

   - • I received a letter, whose poor spelling made me think it was written by a child.

   (more natural would be I received a letter, and its poor spelling...)
   where, when, whereby, why
   We often use the words where, when, and whereby as relative pronouns. But in formal English
   in particular, a phrase with preposition + which can often be used instead:

   - • This was the place (where) we first met. (or ...the place at/in which we...)
   - • He wasn't looking forward to the time (when) he would have to give evidence to the court.

   (or ...the time at which he would...)

   - • Do you know the date when we have to submit the first essay? (or ...the date on/by which

   we have to submit the first essay?)

   - • The government is to end the system whereby (= by which means) farmers make more

   money from leaving land unplanted than from growing wheat, (or ...the system in/by which
   farmers...)
   We can also use why as a relative pronoun after the word reason. In informal English we can use
   that instead of why:

   - • I didn't get a pay rise, but this wasn't the reason why I left, (or ...the reason (that) I left.)

   who, what, whatever, whoever, whichever
   We sometimes use relative clauses beginning with who or what. In this case, who means 'the
   people that' and what means something like 'the thing(s) that':

   - • Can you give me a list of who's been invited?
   - • I didn't know what to do next.

   ©Notice that we can't use what in this way after a noun:

   - • • I managed to get all the books that you asked for. (not ...books what you asked for.)

   Relative clauses beginning with whatever (= anything or it doesn't matter what), whoever (= the
   person/group who or any person/group who), or whichever (= one thing or person from a
   limited number of things or people) are used to talk about things or people that are indefinite or
   unknown:

   - • I'm sure I'll enjoy eating whatever you cook.
   - • Whoever wins will go on to play Barcelona in the final.
   - • Whichever one of you broke the window will have to pay for it.

   K e i a t i v e c l a u s e s ( 4 ) : p r e p o s i t i o n s in r e i a u v e
   c l a u s e s
   In formal styles we often put a preposition before the relative pronouns which and whom:

   - • The rate at which a material heats up depends on its chemical composition.
   - • In the novel by Peters, on which the film is based, the main character is a teenager.
   - • An actor with whom Gelson had previously worked contacted him about the role.
   - • Her many friends, among whom I like to be considered, gave her encouragement.

   Notice that after a preposition you can't use who instead of whom, and you can't use that or zero
   relative pronoun:

   - • Is it right that politicians should make important decisions without consulting the public to

   whom they are accountable? (not ...the public to who they are accountable.)

   - • The valley in which the town lies is heavily polluted, (not The valley in that the town...)
   - • Arnold tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, (not ...the speed at they were

   travelling.)
   In informal English we usually put the preposition later in the relative clause rather than at the
   beginning:

   - • The office which Graham led the way to was filled with books.
   - • Jim's footballing ability, which he was noted for, had been encouraged by his parents.
   - • The playground wasn't used by those children who it was built for.

   this case we prefer who rather than whom (although 'whom' is used in formal contexts). In
   'defining relative clauses we can also use that or zero relative pronoun instead of who or which
   (e.g. ...the children (that) it was built for).
   If the verb in the relative clause is a two- or three-word verb (e.g. come across, fill in, go
   through, look after, look up to, put up with, take on) we don't usually put the preposition
   before the relative pronoun:

   - • Your essay is one of those (which/that) I'll go through tomorrow, (rather than ...through

   which I'll go tomorrow.)

   - • She is one of the few people (who/that) I look up to. (not ...to whom I look up.)

   In formal written English, we often prefer to use of which rather than whose to talk about
   things:

   - • A huge amount of oil was spilled, the effects of which are still being felt, (or ...whose effects

   are still being felt.)

   - • The end of the war, the anniversary of which is on the 16th of November, will be

   commemorated in cities throughout the country, (or ...whose anniversary is on...)
   Notice that we can't use of which instead of whose in the patterns described in Unit 71B:

   - • Dorothy was able to switch between German, Polish and Russian, all of which she spoke

   fluently, (not ...all whose she spoke...)
   We can sometimes use that...of instead of of which. This is less formal than of which and whose,
   and is mainly used in spoken English:

   - • The school that she is head of is closing down, (or The school of which she is head...)

   Whose can come after a preposition in a relative clause. However, it is more natural to put the
   preposition at the end of the clause in less formal contexts and in spoken English:

   - • We were grateful to Mr Marks, in whose car we had travelled home, (or ...whose car we had

   travelled home in.)

   - • I now turn to Freud, from whose work the following quotation is taken, (or ...whose work

   the following quotation is taken from.)

   We can give information about someone or something using an -ing, past participle (-ed) or
   being + past participle (-ed) clause after a noun. These clauses are often similar to defining
   relative clauses (see Unit 70) beginning which, who, or that:

   - • We stood on the bridge connecting the two halves of the building, (or ...which

   connects/connected the two halves...)

   - • The weapon used in the murder has now been found, (or The weapon that was used...)
   - • The prisoners being released are all women, (or ...who are being released...)

   See Unit 75 for participle clauses with a meaning similar to non-defining relative clauses.
   -ing clauses
   We often use an -ing clause instead of a defining relative clause with an active verb:

   - • The man driving the bus is my brother, (or The man who is driving the bus...)
   - • The land stretching away to the left all belongs to Mrs Thompson, (or The land which

   stretches away to the left...)

   - • Police took away Dr Li and items belonging to him. (or ...items which belong/belonged to

   him.)
   Sometimes, however, we can't use an -ing clause. For example:

   - • when there is a noun between the relative pronoun and the verb in the defining relative clause:
   - • The man who Tim is meeting for lunch is from Taiwan, (not ...the man Tim meeting...)
   - • when the event or action talked about in the defining relative clause comes before the event or

   action talked about in the rest of the sentence, except when the second event or action is the
   result of the first. Compare:

   - • The snow which fell overnight has turned to ice. (not The snow falling overnight...) and
   - • The snow which fell overnight has caused traffic chaos, (or The snow falling overnight has

   caused traffic chaos.)

   - • when we talk about a single, completed action in the defining relative clause, rather than a

   continuous action. Compare:

   - • The girl who fell over on the ice broke her arm. (not The girl falling over...) and
   - • I pulled off the sheets which covered the furniture, (or ...sheets covering the furniture.)

   Past participle (-ed) and being + past participle (-ed) clauses
   We often use a past participle or being + past participle clause instead of a defining relative
   clause with a passive verb:

   - • The book published last week is his first written for children, (or The book that was

   published last week...)

   - • The boys being chosen for the team are under 9. (or The boys who are being chosen...)

   Sometimes, however, we can't use a past participle or being + past participle clause. For example:

   - • when there is a noun between the relative pronoun and the verb in the defining relative clause:
   - • The speed at which decisions are made in the company is worrying, (not The speed at which

   decisions made...)

   - • The issue that club members are being asked to vote on at tonight's meeting is that of a fee

   increase... (not The issue being asked to vote on...)

   - • when the defining relative clause includes a modal verb other than will:
   - • There are a number of people who should be asked, (not ...people should be asked.)

   We can use an -ing form of a verb or the past participle in a clause which has an adverbial
   meaning. A clause like this often gives information about TIME or REASONS and RESULTS:

   - • Opening her eyes, the baby began to cry. (= When she opened her eyes...)
   - • Faced with a bill for £10, 000, John has taken an extra job. (= Because he is faced...)

   They are often similar to non-defining relative clauses (see Unit 71) with which, who, or that:

   - • Feeling tired, Louise went to bed early, (or Louise, who was feeling tired, went...)
   - • Formed 25 years ago next month, the club is holding a party for past and present members.

   (or The club, which was formed 25 years ago next month, is holding...)
   The following sentences illustrate other forms of verbs in clauses like this:

   - • Being imported, the radios were more expensive.
   - • Having been hunted close to extinction, the rhino is once again common in this area.

   In negative forms of sentences like this, not usually comes before the -ing form or past participle.
   However, not can follow the -ing form or the past participle, depending on meaning:

   - • Not wanting to wake her, Steve left the house silently. (= He didn't want to...)
   - • Preferring not to go out that night, I made an excuse. (= I preferred not to...)

   ©The implied subject of a clause like this is usually the same as the subject of the main clause:

   - • • Arriving at the party, we saw Ruth standing alone. (= When we arrived...we saw...)

   However, sometimes the implied subject is not referred to in the main clause:

   - • Having wanted to drive a train all his life, this was an opportunity not to be missed.

   In more formal English, the -ing or past participle clause sometimes has its own subject:

   - • The score being level after 90 minutes, a replay will take place.

   In general, using an -ing, past participle, or being + past participle clause instead of a clause
   beginning with a conjunction (when, because, etc.) or a non-defining relative clause makes what
   we say or write more formal. Clauses like this are used particularly in formal or literary writing.
   Some clauses like this are used to give information about TIME:

   - • Glancing over his shoulder, he could see the dog chasing him. (= As he glanced ...)
   - • Having completed the book, he had a holiday. (= After he had completed the book...)

   We use an -ing clause to talk about something that takes place at the same time or very close in
   time to the action in the main clause:

   - • Putting on a serious face, she began to tell the story.

   We often use an -ing clause in written narrative after quoted speech, when we want to say what
   someone was doing while they were talking:

   - • 'Wait a minute,' said Frank, running through the door.

   If the action described is relatively long compared with the one described in the main clause, we
   ouse a clause beginning having + past participle:

   - • • Having driven five hours to the meeting, Don learnt that it had been postponed.

   Sometimes we can use either an -ing clause or a having + past participle clause with similar
   meanings, although using a having + past participle clause emphasises that something is
   completed before the action in the main clause begins. Compare:

   - • Taking off / Having taken off his shoes, Ray walked into the house.

   Some clauses like this are used to talk about REASONS and RESULTS. For example:

   - • Knowing exactly what I wanted, I didn't spend much time shopping.
   - • Being slim, he could squeeze through the opening in the fence.
   - • Having been invited to the party, we could hardly refuse to go.

   When the subject and object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing, we use a reflexive
   pronoun as the object rather than a personal pronoun. Compare:

   - • She forced her to eat it. ('she' and 'her' refer to different people) and
   - • She forced herself to eat it. ('she' and 'herself' refer to the same person)

   The singular forms of reflexive pronouns are myself, yourself, herself, himself, itself; the plural
   forms are ourselves, yourselves, themselves. Some people use themselves (or themself) to refer to
   the subject of the sentence, to avoid saying whether the subject is male or female:

   - • It is a situation that no doctor wants to find themselves {or themself) in.

   We can use reflexive pronouns for emphasis. For example, after an intransitive verb to emphasise
   the subject; after the subject or object (when the verb is transitive) or after the verb (intransitive)
   to emphasise that something is done without help; and after a noun to emphasise that noun:
   ) • We phoned the plumber and he came himself, (he didn't send his employees)

   - • • I hope you like the ice cream -1 made it myself, (nobody helped me)
   - • I was given this book by the author herself, (by her personally)

   We use reflexive pronouns to emphasise that the subject caused a certain action. Compare:

   - • He got arrested, and • He got himself arrested. (= he did something to cause it)

   We use reflexive pronouns with a meaning similar to 'also':

   - • John said he was feeling ill. I was feeling pretty bad myself.

   Some verbs are rarely or never used with a reflexive pronoun in English, but often are in other
   languages. These include complain, concentrate, get up/hot/tired, lie down, meet, relax,
   remember, sit down, wake up:

   - • She concentrated hard on getting the job finished, {not She concentrated herself...)

   With some verbs we only use a reflexive pronoun when we want to emphasise particularly that
   the subject is doing the action. Compare:

   - • She quickly dressed and went down for breakfast, {rather than ...dressed herself...) and
   - • He's recovering well from the accident and he is now able to dress himself.

   Other verbs like this include shave, undress, wash; acclimatise, adapt; behave, hide, move.
   After a preposition of place or position we use a personal pronoun, not a reflexive pronoun:

   - • She put her bag next to her. • Jim had the money with him.

   After prepositions closely linked to their verbs we use a reflexive pronoun when the subject and
   object refer to the same thing:

   - • He came out of the interview looking pleased with himself, {not ...pleased with him.)

   Other verb + prepositions like this include be ashamed of, believe in, care about, do with, hear
   about, look after, look at, take care of.
   Some verbs describe actions in which two or more people or things do the same thing to the
   other(s). We use each other or one another with these:

   - • We looked at each other / one another and started to laugh.
   - • Peter and Jenny met (each other) in 1992. ('each other' is often left out if the meaning is

   clear from the context)
   Other verbs like this include attract, avoid, complement, embrace, face, fight, help, kiss, marry,
   meet, repel. With some verbs we have to use with before each other / one another:

   - • The scheme allows students from many countries to communicate with each other.

   Other verbs like this include agree, coincide, collaborate, compete, contrast, co-operate,
   disagree, joke, mix, quarrel, talk.

   O n e a n d o n e s ( T h e r e ' s m y c a r - t h e g r e e n o n e . )
   We can use one instead of repeating a singular countable noun when it is clear from the context
   what we are talking about:

   - • 'Can I get you a drink?' 'It's okay, I've already got one (= a drink).'
   - • 'Is this your umbrella?' 'No, mine's the big blue one (= umbrella).'

   Ones can be used instead of repeating a plural noun:

   - • I think his best poems are his early ones (= poems).
   - • People who smoke aren't the only ones (= people) affected by lung cancer.

   We don't use one/ones instead of an uncountable noun:

   - • If you need any more paper, I'll bring you some, (not ...one/ones.)
   - • I asked him to get apple juice, but he got orange, (not ...orange one/ones.)

   Notice that we can't use ones without additional information (e.g. small ones, ones with blue
   laces). Instead, we use some. Compare:

   - • We need new curtains. Okay, let's buy green ones this time. / ...ones with flowers on. and
   - • We need new curtains. Okay, let's buy some, (not ...let's buy ones.)

   We don't use one/ones:

   - • after a - instead we leave out a:
   - • Have we got any lemons? I need one for a meal I'm cooking, (not ...need a one...)
   - • after nouns used as adjectives:
   - • I thought I'd put the keys in my trouser pocket, but in fact they were in my jacket pocket.

   (not ...my jacket one.)
   Instead of using one/ones after personal pronouns (my, your, her, etc.) we prefer mine, yours,
   hers, etc. However, a personal pronoun + one/ones is often heard in informal speech:

   - • I'd really like a watch like yours, (or '...like your one.' in informal speech)

   We can leave out one/ones:

   - • after which:
   - • When we buy medicines, we have no way of knowing which (ones) contain sugar.
   - • after superlatives:
   - • Look at that pumpkin! It's the biggest (one) I've seen this year.
   - • If you buy a new car, remember that the most economical (ones) are often the smallest.
   - • after this, that, these, and those:
   - • The last test I did was quite easy, but some parts of this (one) are really difficult.
   - • Help yourself to grapes. These (ones) are the sweetest, but those (ones) taste best.

   (Note that some people think 'those ones' is incorrect, particularly in formal English.)

   - • after either, neither, another, each, the first/second/last, etc. (the forms without one/ones are

   more formal):

   - • Karl pointed to the paintings and said I could take either (one), (or ...either of them.)
   - • She cleared away the cups, washed each (one) thoroughly, and put them on the shelf.

   We don't leave out one/ones:

   - • after the, the only, the main, and every:
   - • When you cook clams you shouldn't eat the ones that don't open.
   - • After I got the glasses home, I found that every one was broken.
   - • after adjectives:
   - • My shoes were so uncomfortable that I had to go out today and buy some new ones.

   However, after colour adjectives we can often leave out one/ones in answers:

   - • 'Have you decided which jumper to buy?' 'Yes, I think I'll take the blue (one).'

   c a n u s e s o m s t e a d °^ repeating an adjective, adverb, or a whole clause:

   - • The workers were angry and they had every right to be so. (= angry)
   - • John took the work seriously and Petra perhaps even more so. (= seriously)
   - • Bob should be the new director. At least I think so. (= that he should be the new director)

   We often use so instead of a clause after verbs concerned with thinking, such as be afraid,
   appear/seem (after 'it'), assume, believe, expect, guess, hope, imagine, presume, suppose,
   suspect, think, and also after say and after tell (with an object):

   - • Paul will be home next week - at least we hope so. (= that he will be home next week)
   - • I found the plan ridiculous, and said so. (- that I found the plan ridiculous)

   Notice that we don't use so after certain other verbs, including accept, admit, agree, be certain,
   claim, doubt, hear, intend, promise, suggest, be sure:

   - • Liz will organise the party. She promised (that) she would, (not She promised so.)
   - • The train will be on time today. I'm sure (that) it will, (not I'm sure so.)

   In negative sentences, we use not or not...so:

   - • Is the Socialist Party offering anything new in its statement? It would appear not.
   - • They want to buy the house, although they didn't say so directly.

   We can use either not or not...so with appear, seem, suppose:

   - • 'I don't suppose there'll be any seats left.' 'No, I don't suppose so.'(or ...I suppose not.)

   We prefer not...so with believe, expect, imagine, think. With these verbs, not is rather formal:

   - • Had she taken a wrong turning? She didn't think so. (rather than She thought not.)

   a We use not with be afraid, assume, guess, hope, presume, suspect:

   - • • 'Do ' you think we'll be late?"I^ope not.' (not I don't hope so.)

   Compare the use of not (to) and not...so with say:

   - • 'Do we have to do all ten questions?' 'The teacher said not.' (= the teacher said that we

   didn't have to) or 'The teacher said not to.' (= the teacher said that we weren't to.)

   - • 'Do we have to do all ten questions?' 'The teacher didn't say so.' (= the teacher didn't say

   that we should do all ten, but perhaps we should)
   We can use so in a short answer, instead of a short answer with 'Yes, ...', when we want to say
   that we can see that something is true, now that we have been told, particularly if we are
   surprised that it is true:

   - • 'Jack and Martha are here.' 'So they are.' (or Yes, they are.) (= I can see that, too, now)
   - • 'Mimi has cut her face.' 'So she has.' (or Yes, she has.) (= I can see that, too, now)

   In answers like this we use so + pronoun + auxiliary verb (be, have, do, can, could, etc.).
   Compare the short answers in:

   - • 'Your bike's been moved.' 'So it has. (or Yes, it has.) I wonder who did it.' (= I didn't know

   before you told me) and

   - • 'Your bike's been moved.' 'Yes, it has. Philip borrowed it this morning.' (= I knew before

   you told me)
   We can use so in a similar way in short answers with verbs such as appear (after 'it'), believe,

   do so
   We use do so instead of repeating a verb + object or verb + complement when it is clear from the
   context what we are talking about. We can also use does so, did so, doing so, etc.:

   - • She won the competition in 1997 and seems likely to do so (= win the competition) again

   this year.

   - • Dr Lawson said, 'Sit down.' Cathy did so (= sat down), and started to talk about her

   problems.

   - • The climbers will try again today to reach the summit of the mountain. Their chances of

   doing so (= reaching the summit of the mountain) are better than they were last week. (In
   very formal English we can also use so doing.)

   - • When he was asked to check the figures, he claimed that he had already done so. (= checked

   the figures)
   Do so is most often used in formal spoken and written English. In informal English we can use
   do it or do that rather than do so:

   - • Mrs Bakewell waved as she walked past. She does so/it/that every morning.
   - • Ray told me to put in a new battery. I did so/it/that, but the radio still doesn't work.

   We can also use do alone rather than do so in less formal English, especially after modals or
   perfect tenses (see also B):

   - • 'Will this programme work on your computer?' 'It should do.'
   - • I told you that I'd finish the work by today, and I have done, ('have' is stressed here)

   D Study the following sentences:
   do so

   - • 65% of the members voted for Ken Brown

   this time, whereas 84% did so last year.

   - • Kenyon confessed to the murder, although

   he only did so after a number of witnesses
   had identified him as the killer.
   do (not do so)

   - • John doesn't like Porter's films but I do.

   (not ...I do so.)

   - • I never expect them to remember my

   birthday, but they usually do. (not
   ...usually do so.)
   We can use do so instead of verbs that describe actions (dynamic verbs), such as vote and
   confess. We don't use do so with verbs that describe states, such as like and remember.
   such
   We can use such + (a/an) + noun to refer back to something mentioned before, with the meaning
   'of this/ that kind'. We use such + noun when the noun is uncountable or plural, and such + a/an
   + noun when the noun is countable:
   i • They needed someone who was both an excellent administrator and manager. Such a person
   * was not easy to find.

   - • We allow both men and women to have time off work to bring up children. We were the

   first department to introduce such a scheme.

   - • The students refer to teachers by their first names and will often criticise them for badly-

   prepared lessons. Such behaviour is unacceptable in most schools.

   - • When asked about rumours that the company is preparing to shed more than 200 jobs, a

   spokeswoman said: 'I know of no such plans.'
   Such is used in this way mainly in formal speech and writing. More informally we can use, for
   example, 'A person like this...', '...a scheme of this kind.', 'This sort of behaviour...', etc.

   L e a v i n g o u t w o r d s a f t e r a u x i l i a r y v e r b s
   Study the following examples:

   - • She says she's finished, but I don't think she has. (instead of ...has finished.)
   - • 'Are you going to read it?' 'Well, no, I'm not.' (instead of ...I'm not going to read it.)
   - • 'Would any of you like to come with me to Venice?' 'I would.' (instead of I would like to

   come with you to Venice.)
   To avoid repeating words from a previous clause or sentence we use an auxiliary verb (be, have,
   can, will, would, etc.) instead of a whole verb group (e.g. 'has finished') or instead of a verb and
   what follows it (e.g. 'going to read it', 'like to come with you to Venice').
   If there is more than one auxiliary verb in the previous clause or sentence, we leave out all the
   auxiliary verbs except the first instead of repeating the main verb. Alternatively, we can use two
   (or more) auxiliary verbs:

   - • Alex hadn't been invited to the meal, although his wife had. {or ...had been.)
   - • 'They could have been delayed by the snow.' 'Yes, they could.' (or ...could have (been).)

   D If there is no auxiliary verb in the previous clause or sentence, or if the auxiliary is a form of do,
   we use a form of do instead of repeating the main verb:

   - • I now play chess as well as he does, (instead of ...as well as he plays chess.)
   - • 'I didn't steal the money.' 'No-one thinks that you did.' (instead of ...that you stole it.)

   If be is the main verb in the previous clause or sentence, we repeat a form of the verb be:

   - • 'The children are noisy again.' 'They always are.'
   - • 'I'm not happy in my job.' 'I thought you were.'

   If have is the main verb in the previous clause or sentence, we usually use a form of either do or
   have:

   - • 'Do you think I have a chance of winning?' 'Yes, I think you have.' (or ...you do.)
   - • Even if he hasn't got a map himself, he may know someone who has. (or ...who does.)

   For particular emphasis, we can also use do have, etc. For example, in the first sentence above
   we can use '...I think you do have'. (In spoken English we would stress 'do'.)
   However, if we use have + noun in the previous clause or sentence to talk about actions (have a
   nshower, have lunch, have a good time, etc.) we prefer do:

   - • • I wasn't expecting to have a good time at the party, but I did.

   If we use have as an auxiliary verb, we can follow it with done:

   - • The restaurant is to ban smoking, just as many other restaurants in the city have (done).
   - • 'She's never made a mistake before.' 'Well she has (done) this time.'

   In a similar way, after a modal auxiliary verb (can, could, may, might, must, ought to, shall,
   should, will, would) we can use do, particularly in spoken English:

   - • 'Will you see Tony today?' 'I might (do).'
   - • 'Mat's operation next week is worrying him a lot.' 'Yes, I suppose it would (do).'

   If we use be as an auxiliary verb in the previous clause or sentence, we can use be after a modal:

   - • 'Is Ella staying for lunch?' 'Yes, I think she will (be).'

   However, if be is used as a main verb in the previous clause or sentence, or as an auxiliary verb
   within a passive, we don't leave out be after a modal:

   - • Shannon isn't a great footballer now and, in my view, never will be.
   - • The book was delivered within a week. The shop had said it would be.

   We can sometimes use to instead of a clause beginning with a to-infinitive when it is clear from
   the context what we are talking about:

   - • I wanted to come with you, but I won't be able to. (instead of ...to come with you.)
   - • 'I can't lend you any more money.' 'I'm not asking you to.' (instead of ...to lend me more

   money.)

   - • It might have been better if Rosa had asked for my help, but she chose not to. (instead of

   ...chose not to ask for my help.)
   However, when we use parts of the verb be in the previous sentence or clause the infinitive form
   of the verb (to be) is repeated after to:

   - • Simon was frightened - or maybe he just pretended to be. (not ...just pretended to.)
   - • The report is very critical and is clearly intended to be. (not ...clearly intended to.)

   We sometimes leave out a to-infinitive clause or use to after certain adjectives and nouns:

   - • 'Could you and Tom help me move house?' 'Well, I'm willing (to), and I'll ask Tom.'
   - • I'm not going to write another book - at least I don't have any plans (to).

   We can also leave out a to-infinitive or use to with the verbs agree, ask, expect, forget, promise,
   refuse, try, wish:

   - • Robert will collect us by 10 o'clock. He promised (to).
   - • 'You were supposed to buy some sugar.' 'Sorry, I forgot (to).'

   However, when we use negative forms of expect and wish we don't leave out to:

   - • We saw Maggie in Scotland, although we didn't expect to. (not ...we didn't expect.)

   After some verbs we don't leave out to:

   - • I admit that I took her watch, but I didn't mean to.
   - • 'Please suggest changes to the plans if you want.' 'I intend to.'

   Other verbs like this include advise (+ noun), be able, choose, deserve, fail, hate, hope, need,
   prefer.
   After want and would like in //-clauses and w/7-clauses we can leave out a to-infinitive or use to:

   - • You're welcome to dance if you'd like (to).
   - • You can do whatever you would like (to).
   - • Call me Fred if you want (to).
   - • Take what you want (to) and leave the rest.

   Oln other cases we include to:

   - • • I was planning to see you tomorrow, and I would still like to.
   - • They offered to clean your car because they want to, not because they hope to be paid.

   After like we leave out a to-infinitive:

   - • Say anything you like. I won't be offended.
   - • You can have one of these cakes if you like.

   However, we include to with negative forms of want, would like, and like, including in //-clauses

   Many adjectives can be put either before the noun they describe, or following linking verbs such
   as appear, be, become, feel, get, and seem (see Unit 26):

   - • The hot sun beat down on us all day. or • The sun was hot.
   - • The high price surprised him. or • The price seemed high.

   Some adjectives are seldom or never used before the noun they describe. These include:
   Some 'a-' adjectives: afraid, alight, alike, alive,
   alone, ashamed, asleep, awake, aware
   Some adjectives when they describe health and
   feelings: content, fine, glad, ill (notice that 'sick'
   can be used before a noun), poorly, sorry, (un)sure,
   upset, (un)well. (However, these words can
   sometimes be used between an adverb and a
   noun e.g. 'a terminally ill patient'.)

   - • The horse was alone in the field.

   (but not The alone horse...)

   - • My son felt unwell, {but not My

   unwell son...)
   Some of these 'a-' adjectives have related adjectives that can be used either before a noun or after
   a linking verb. Compare:

   - • The animal was alive. and • A living animal, (or The animal was living.)

   Other pairs like this include: afraid - frightened, alike - similar, asleep - sleeping.
   Notice that (un)happy can be used in both positions:

   - • He's an unhappy man. and • The man felt unhappy.

   Some classifying and emphasising adjectives are seldom or never used after a linking verb. For
   example, we can talk about 'a nuclear explosion', but we can't say 'The explosion was nuclear.'
   Other adjectives like this include:
   Classifying adjectives: atomic, cubic, digital,
   medical, phonetic; chief, entire, initial, main,
   only, whole; eventual, occasional,
   northern (etc.), maximum, minimum, underlying
   Emphasising adjectives: absolute, complete,
   mere, utter

   - • The main problem has now been

   solved.

   - • I spent my entire savings on the

   project.

   - • I felt an absolute idiot when I found

   that I hadn't got any money.
   Some adjectives can be used immediately after a noun. These include:

   - • some -ible and -able adjectives such as available, imaginable, possible, suitable. However, we

   use these adjectives immediately after a noun only when the noun follows words such as first,
   last, next, only and superlative adjectives, or when a prepositional phrase follows the adjective:

   - • It's the only treatment suitable, (or ...the only suitable treatment.)
   - • It is an offer available to club members only.
   - • concerned, involved, opposite, present, responsible. These words have different meanings

   when they are used before a noun and immediately after it. Compare:
   ( • I was asked for my present address. (= my address now) and
   * • All the people present (= who were there) approved of the decision.

   - • The party was excellent, and I'd like to thank all the people concerned (= involved), and
   - • Cars drive too fast past the school and concerned (= worried) teachers have complained to

   the police.

   Gradable and ungradable adjectives
   Gradable adjectives can be used with adverbs such as very or extremely to say that a thing or
   person has more or less of a particular quality. Ungradable adjectives themselves imply 'to a
   large degree' and are seldom used with these adverbs. Instead, we can use adverbs such as
   absolutely or totally.
   adverbs
   adverbs
   extremely, deeply, fairly,
   hugely, immensely, pretty
   (informal), rather, really,
   reasonably, slightly, very
   absolutely, completely,
   entirely, pretty, really,
   simply, totally, utterly
   angry, big, busy, comfortable,
   common, happy, important, quiet,
   rich, strong, young
   amazed, awful, dreadful, furious,
   huge, impossible, invaluable,
   terrible, wonderful, useless

   ungradable
   adjectives
   a • Our teacher gave us a completely impossible problem to solve.

   - • • She was extremely rich.

   Notice that not all the adverbs given can go with all the adjectives given. For example, we
   « wouldn't usually say 'completely essential' (see also Unit 92). Really and pretty can be used with

   - • both gradable and ungradable adjectives.

   More on the position of adjectives
   When we use more than one adjective before a noun, there is often a preferred order for these
   adjectives. However, this order is not fixed: opinion + size/physical quality/shape/age + colour +
   participle adjectives (see Unit 85) + origin + material + type + purpose + noun.
   an old plastic container
   a hard red ball
   a frightening Korean mask
   a round biscuit tin
   a small broken plate
   a useful digital alarm clock
   (= age + material + noun)
   (= quality + colour + noun)
   (= opinion + origin + noun)
   (= shape + purpose (for holding biscuits) + noun)
   (= size + participle adjective + noun)
   (= opinion + type + purpose + noun)
   To help you to learn this order, it can be useful to remember that gradable adjectives
   Q (describing opinion, size, quality, shape, and age) usually precede ungradable adjectives

   - • (participle adjective and adjectives describing origin, material, type and purpose).

   When two gradable adjectives come before the noun, we can put either a comma or and between
   them. Compare:

   - • an attractive, big garden and • an attractive and big garden

   Two colour adjectives have and between them:

   - • Sweden's yellow and blue flag {not ...yellow, blue flag)

   Two ungradable adjectives have and between them if they are from the same class, but and is
   not used if they are from different classes. Compare:

   - • financial and political conditions and • improving financial conditions

   Study the word order when a to-infinitive or prepositional phrase follows an adjective:

   - • It's a difficult word to say. / • It's an identical car to mine. </
   - • It's a word (that is) difficult to say. / • It's a car (that is) identical to mine. /
   - • It's a difficult to say word. X • It's an identical to mine car. X

   Adjectives: position (1) => Ifflffig

   We use an adverb, not an adjective

   - • to say how something happened or was done:
   - • I've always greatly enjoyed his novels, (not ...great enjoyed...)
   - • The people who work in that shop always talk politely to customers, (not ...polite...)
   - • to modify adjectives, including participle adjectives (see Unit 85):
   - • It was strangely quiet in the room. • They had a beautifully furnished house.

   Some adverbs are formed from an adjective + -ly: happy —* happily, etc. When an adjective
   already ends in -ly (e.g. cowardly, friendly, kindly, lively, lonely) we don't add -ly to it to make
   an adverb. Instead we can use a prepositional phrase with fashion, manner, or way:

   - • He smiled at me in a friendly way. • She waved her hands around in a lively fashion.

   Most participle adjectives ending in -ed (see Unit 85) don't have an adverb form and we can use
   a similar prepositional phrase:

   - • They rose to greet me in a subdued manner.
   - • She walked around the room in an agitated way. (or ...in agitation.)

   However, some do have an adverb form with -ly, including the following common ones:
   allegedly, belatedly, contentedly, dejectedly, deservedly, excitedly, hurriedly, markedly, pointedly,
   repeatedly, reportedly, reputedly, supposedly, unexpectedly, wholeheartedly, wickedly:

   - • The weather had turned unexpectedly stormy.

   Some adverbs have two forms, one ending -ly and the other not. We can sometimes use either of
   the two forms of the adverb without changing the meaning, although the form ending in -ly is
   more usual in a formal style:

   - • I'll be there as quick(ly) as I can. • Try to sing loud(ly) in the last verse.

   Other words like this include cheap(ly), clean(ly), clear(ly), fine(ly), slow(ly), thin(ly).
   In other cases there is a difference in the meaning of the adverb with and without -ly:

   - • She gave her time free. (= for no money) and She gave her time freely. (= willingly)
   - • I arrived late for the concert. and I haven't seen John lately. (= recently)

   Here are some other pairs of adverbs that can have different meanings. Compare:

   - • Do I have to change trains in Leeds?' 'No,

   you can go direct (= without stopping).'

   - • She worked really hard and passed her

   exams.

   - • He kicked the ball high over the goal.
   - • They cut short their holiday when John

   became ill. (= went home early)

   - • The door was wide (= completely) open

   so I just went straight in.

   - • I'll be with you directly (= very soon).
   - • He saw Susan directly (= straight) ahead.
   - • The telephone line was so bad, I could

   hardly (= only just) hear what he was saying.

   - • Everyone thinks highly of her teaching.

   (= they praise her for it)

   - • The speaker will be arriving shortly

   (= soon). Please take your seats.

   - • It won't be difficult to get the book. It's

   widely available. (= in many places)
   I
   Remember that good is an adjective and well is an adverb:

   - • I asked Francis to clean the car, and he did a good job. / ...and he did the job well.

   However, well is also an adjective meaning 'healthy':

   - • You're not looking too well. Are you okay?

   Some present participles (-ing forms) and past participles (-ed forms) of verbs can be used as
   adjectives. Most of these participle adjectives can be used before the noun they describe or
   following linking verbs (see Unit 82A):

   - • She gave me a welcoming cup of tea.
   - • I found this broken plate in the kitchen cupboard.
   - • The students' tests results were pleasing.
   - • My mother appeared delighted with the present.

   D We can use some participles immediately after nouns in order to identify or define the noun.
   This use is similar to defining relative clauses (see Units 70 and 74):

   - • A cheer went up from the crowds watching, {or ...the crowds that were watching.)
   - • We had to pay for the rooms used, {or ...the rooms that were used.)

   A few participles are used immediately after nouns, but rarely before them (see Unit 82D):

   - • None of the candidates applying was accepted, {but not ...the applying candidates...)

   k • My watch was among the things taken, {but not ...the taken things. )

   - • Other participles like this include caused, found, provided, used.

   Some participles can be used before or immediately after nouns. For example, we can say:

   - • Rub the area infected with this antiseptic cream, or
   - • Rub the infected area with this antiseptic cream.

   Other participles like this include affected, broken, chosen, identified, interested, remaining,
   resulting, stolen.
   Remember the differences between the following pairs of adjectives: alarmed - alarming,
   amazed - amazing, bored - boring, excited - exciting, frightened - frightening, pleased -
   pleasing, surprised - surprising, tired - tiring, worried - worrying. When we use these adjectives
   to describe how someone feels about something, the -ing adjectives describe the 'something' (e.g.
   a surprising decision) and the -ed adjectives describe the 'someone' (e.g. I was surprised).
   Compare:

   - • I'm pleased with the result. and • It's a pleasing result.
   - • The bored children started to get restless. and • The play was really boring.

   We often form compound adjectives with a participle following a noun, adverb, or another
   adjective, and connected by a hyphen:

   - • I hope it will be a money-making enterprise.
   - • They are well-behaved children.
   - • The newly-built ship is on its maiden voyage.
   - • A worried-looking lawyer left the court.
   - • We walked past an evil-smelling pond.
   - • A slow-moving lorry was causing the

   delays.
   Notice that we can use some participle adjectives only when they are used in this pattern. For
   example, we can't say '...a making enterprise', '...behaved children', or '...a built ship' as the
   sense is incomplete without the adverb or noun.
   In formal English, that and those can be used before a participle adjective:

   - • The office temperature is lower than that (= the temperature) required by law.
   - • Here is some advice for those (= people) preparing to go on holiday.

   In examples like this, those normally means 'people'.

   When an adjective follows a linking verb (see Unit 26) with a personal subject (rather than
   'It...'; see D below) we can put a number of things after the adjective, including:
   , D
   adjective +
   that-clause (to talk about someone's feeling
   or opinion, or about how sure we are of
   something)

   - • He became worried (that) she might leap

   - • They're very easy to please.

   -ing form

   examples
   afraid, alarmed, amazed, angry, annoyed,
   ashamed, astonished, aware, concerned,
   delighted, disappointed, glad, (un)happy,
   pleased, shocked, sorry, upset, worried;
   certain, confident, positive, sure (with the
   exception of aware and confident these can
   also be followed by a to-infinitive)
   (un)able, careful, crazy, curious, difficult,
   easy, free, good, hard, impossible, inclined,
   nice, prepared, readv, welcome, willing
   busy, worth (these can't be followed by a
   that-clause or to-infinitive)
   Most of the adjectives listed as being followed by a to-infinitive can't be followed by a that-clause.
   However, for the adjectives underlined above we can use adjective + to-infinitive + that-clause:
   O • She was ready to admit (that) I was right.

   - • • They were prepared to accept that my idea was a good one.

   Sometimes we can use adjective + preposition + -ing form (see Unit 86B) or adjective + to-
   infinitive with little difference in meaning:

   - • He wasn't ashamed of asking for more money. or ...ashamed to ask for more money.

   However, in some cases there is a difference. Compare:

   - • I'm sorry to disturb you. (= I'm disturbing you now) and
   - • I'm sorry for disturbing you. (= I disturbed you earlier)

   We can often avoid beginning a sentence with a that-clause or a to-infinitive, by using It...:

   - • It became clear that I wasn't welcome, [rather than That I wasn't welcome was clear.)
   - • It is essential to get there early, [rather than To get there early is essential.)

   Notice that we can put of + subject or for + subject between the adjective and a to-infinitive:

   - • It was generous of her to take on the job. (or She was generous to take on the job.)
   - • It seemed difficult for him to walk.

   Other adjectives which take of + subject in this pattern include careless, greedy, kind, nice, silly,
   wrong. Those which take for + subject include easy, essential, hard, important, impossible,
   necessary, unacceptable, vital.
   We can also use it + adjective after verbs such as believe, consider, feel, find, think before a that-
   clause or to-infinitive:

   - • I thought it dreadful that Liz was asked to resign.
   - • They consider it wrong to smoke in public places.

   -er/more...;-est/most...
   We usually add the ending -er to one-syllable adjectives to make their comparative forms and
   -est to make their superlative forms. For adjectives with three or more syllables we usually add
   more/less and most/least.
   Some adjectives with two syllables are only used or are most commonly used with more/less and
   most/least, particularly participle adjectives (e.g. pleased, worried, boring) (see Unit 85);
   adjectives ending in -ful and -less (e.g. careful, careless); afraid, alike, alert, ashamed, alone,
   aware; and also cautious, certain, complex, confident, eager, exact, formal, frequent, modern,
   recent. Most other adjectives with two syllables can take either form.
   9Some adjectives have a comparative or superlative meaning so they are rarely used with
   -er/-est or more/less/ most/least. These include complete, equal, favourite, ideal, unique.
   An exception: 'All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.'
   (George Orwell: Animal Farm)
   Enough, sufficiently, too
   We use enough before nouns (e.g. 'Is there enough bread?') and after adjectives (and adverbs):

   - • The house was comfortable enough but not luxurious, (not ...enough comfortable...)
   - • We are not in a strong enough financial position to cut taxes, (not ...an enough strong...)

   Compare the position of enough in these sentences with adjective + noun:

   - • I haven't got big enough nails for the job. (= the nails that I've got aren't big enough) and
   - • I haven't got enough big nails for the job. (= I've got some big nails, but not enough)

   We use sufficiently before adjectives with a meaning similar to enough. Sufficiently is often
   preferred in more formal contexts:
   © • The policies of the parties were not sufficiently different, (or ...not different enough.)

   - • • Things would be easier if we only had a sufficiently simple system, (or ...a simple enough

   system.)
   Study these sentences with adjective + enough and too + adjective:

   - • The beams have to be strong enough to support the roof.
   - • She was too ashamed to admit her mistake.
   - • The garage was just about big enough for two cars to fit in.
   - • The suitcase was too small (for him) to get all his clothes in.

   <j)We talk about an action in the to-infinitive clause. If we need to mention the things or people
   'involved, we do this with for... .
   In rather formal English we can use too + adjective + a/an + noun:

   - • I hope you haven't had too tiring a day. (not ...a too tiring day.)

   (In a less formal style we might say 'I hope your day hasn't been too tiring.')
   The sooner the better
   To say that as one thing changes, another thing also changes, we can use sentences like:

   - • The better the joke (is), the louder the laugh (is).
   - • The longer Sue stays in Canada, the less likely she will ever go back to England.
   - • It almost seems that the more expensive the wedding, the shorter the marriage!

   As...as
   We use as... as with an adjective or adverb in between to say that something or someone is like
   something or someone else, or that one situation is like another:

   - • Was the film as funny as his last one?
   - • Andrew came round to my flat as quickly as he could.

   Negative forms of sentences like this can use either not as or not so. In formal speech and
   writing it is more common to use less than:

   - • The gap between the sides is not as wide as it was. (or ...is less wide than it was.)
   - • The bees are plentiful, but not so common as last summer, (or ...but less common than last

   summer.)

   - • Some people find cooking easy, but others are not as/so fortunate (as these).

   We use not so rather than not as in a number of common expressions. For example: I'm not so
   sure; It's (= the situation is) not so bad; Not so loud! (= be more quiet); He's not so good (= not
   very well).
   If you put a countable noun between the adjective and the second as, you should use a/an in
   front of the noun (if the noun is singular):
   n • Despite his disability, he tried to lead as normal a life as possible.

   - • • She was as patient a teacher as anyone could have had.

   The negative form of sentences like this can use either not as or sometimes not such:

   - • He's not as good a player as he used to be.
   - • He's not such a good player as he used to be. (Notice the different word order.)
   - • They're not such terrible children as we'd expected. (We don't use not as with plural nouns.)

   We can use how, so and too followed by an adjective in a similar way:

   - • How significant a role did he play in your life?
   - • It's not quite so straightforward a problem as it might at first seem.
   - • 'Conspiracy' is perhaps too strong a word.
   - • How big a piece do you want?

   as...as is also used in sentences with much and many to talk about quantities (see Unit 64):

   - • She earns at least as much as Mark, and probably more.
   - • London has twice as many banks as the rest of south-east England.

   We also use as much/many as or as little/few as (see Unit 68) to say that a quantity or amount is
   larger or smaller than expected. Many and few are used before numbers; much and little are
   used with amounts such as $5 and 20%, and distances such as 3 metres:
   a • There is a small number involved, possibly as few as a hundred, (not ...as little as...)

   - • • Prices have increased by as much as 300 per cent.

   So...that;so...asto
   We can use so followed by an adjective or an adverb and a that-clause in sentences such as:

   - • The recipe was so simple that even I could cook it. (= because the recipe was so simple, even

   I could cook it)

   - • He was walking so slowly that before too long we caught him up. (= because he was

   walking so slowly...)
   Less commonly we use so followed by an adjective and as to with a similar meaning:

   - • The difference was so small as to not be worth arguing about. (= because the difference was

   so small, it wasn't worth arguing about)

   P o s i t i o n o f a d v e r b s
   There are three main positions for adverbs which modify a verb:
   front position = before the subject
   mid position - between the subject and verb,
   or immediately after be as a main verb (see C)
   end position = after the verb

   - • Finally he could stand the noise no longer.
   - • He usually plays better than this.
   - • She's usually here by 10.00.
   - • I've been waiting for hours.

   Most types of adverb can go in front position. In particular:
   type of adverb
   connecting adverbs e.g.
   as a result, similarly
   time and place adverbs e.g.
   tomorrow, in the kitchen
   comment and viewpoint
   adverbs e.g. presumably,
   financially
   function
   ...to make immediately clear
   the logical relation to the
   previous sentence
   ...to show a contrast with,
   or expansion on, a previous
   reference to time or place
   ...to highlight the speaker's
   attitude to what they are
   about to say
   example

   - • The value of the yen has

   fallen. As a result, Japan
   faces a crisis.

   - • The last few days have been

   hot. Tomorrow the weather
   will be much cooler.

   - • She has just heard that her

   sister is ill. Presumably, she
   will want to go home.
   The following types of adverb usually go in mid position: adverbs of indefinite frequency e.g.
   always, never, usually; degree adverbs e.g. completely, quite, and focus adverbs e.g. just, even:
   9 • He always sings when he's having a shower.

   - • I completely forgot her birthday, and I just don't know how to make it up to her.

   Most adverbs of time or place don't go in this position:

   - • Jane had a baby in October, {not Jane in October had a baby.)

   However, a few often do, including already, finally, now, recently, soon, still:

   - • I finally met Roy at the conference in Madrid.

   and in journalism, other adverbs of time are often used in mid position:

   - • The government yesterday announced an increase in education spending.

   In mid position, we put adverbs where we would put not, or after it if not is already there:

   - • Sue's never at home these days, {compare 'Sue isn't at home...') • I don't fully understand.
   - • It has seldom been seen here before, {compare 'It hasn't been seen...')

   oln end position, we usually put an adverb after an object or complement if there is one:

   - • • He studied the problem briefly, {not He studied briefly the problem.)

   However, if an object or complement is very long, then we often put an adverb between the verb
   and its object or complement. This is particularly common in journalism:

   - • We considered briefly the long-term solution to the problem.

   When there is more than one adverb in end position, the usual order in written English is adverb
   of manner (= saying how something is done), place, and then time:

   - • In the accident she was thrown violently against the door. (= manner + place)

   However, if one adverb is much longer than another then it is usually placed last:

   - • They left at 3.00 with a great deal of noise. (= time + manner)

   Place, time, indefinite frequency adverbs = Degree adverbs = Comment, viewpoint, focus adverbs =

   Adverbs of place
   Adverbs of place usually go in end position, but we can put them in front position to show a
   contrast or expansion (see Unit 90). This order is found mainly in descriptive writing and
   reports. Compare:

   - • The money was eventually found under the floorboards. (= end) and
   - • The police searched the house and under the floorboards they found a body. {= front)

   If we put an adverb of place in front position we have to put the subject after the verb be:

   - • Next to the bookshelf was a fireplace, (not Next to the bookshelf a fireplace was.)

   We can also do this with intransitive verbs used to indicate position or movement to a position,
   including hang, lie, live, sit, stand; come, fly, go, march, roll, run, swim, walk:

   - • Beyond the houses lay open fields, (rather than ...open fields lay.)
   - • Through the town square marched the band, [rather than ...the band marched.)

   However, we don't do this if one of these intransitive verbs is followed by an adverb of manner,
   with other intransitive verbs, or with transitive verbs:

   - • Above his head the sword hung menacingly, (not ...hung the sword menacingly.)
   - • Outside the church the choir sang, (not ...sang the choir.)
   - • In the garden John built a play house for the children, (not In the garden built John...)

   Adverbs of indefinite frequency
   Some adverbs of indefinite frequency, which say in an indefinite way how often something
   happens, usually go in mid position. These include hardly ever, often, rarely, regularly, seldom,
   and also never and always (but see C below):

   - • She regularly comes home after midnight.

   Other adverbs of indefinite frequency, such as normally, occasionally, sometimes, and usually,
   pcan also go in front or end position:

   - • • I normally (= mid) get up at six o'clock, but sometimes (= front) I have to be up by five.

   In formal, literary English, adverbs of indefinite frequency which have a negative meaning can
   go in front position. The subject must come after an auxiliary verb or a main verb be in
   sentences like this:

   - • Never had we encountered such an unreasonable official, (not Never we had encountered...)
   - • Not once was he at home when I phoned, (not Not once he was...)

   Other adverbs like this include hardly ever, rarely, seldom, and also at no time.
   If there is no auxiliary verb, we use do. Compare:

   - • He never admitted that his team played badly, and
   - • At no time did he admit that his team played badly, (not At no time he admitted...)

   Adverbs of time
   Adverbs of time, which indicate a definite point or period in time or a definite frequency, usually
   go in front or end position, but not in mid position:
   ty • I went to Paris yesterday. or • Yesterday I went to Paris.

   - • • We play tennis twice a week. or • Twice a week we play tennis.

   However, the adverbs daily, hourly, monthly, weekly etc. only go in end position:

   - • The train leaves Penn station hourly, (not Hourly the train leaves...; not The train hourly

   leaves...)
   Position of adverbs = Time adverbs; Inversion:

   Degree adverbs can be used before adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs to give information about
   the extent or degree of something. Compare:

   - • They're happy. and • They're extremely happy.
   - • I hate travelling by plane. and • I really hate travelling by plane.
   - • He's always late. and • He's almost always late.

   Other degree adverbs include completely, fairly, quite, rather, slightly, too, totally, very (much).
   Very and too
   Before an adjective or another adverb we use very when we mean 'to a high degree', and too
   when we mean 'more than enough' or 'more than is wanted or needed'. Compare:

   - • The weather was very hot in Majorca. Perfect for swimming, {not ...too hot...) and
   - • It's too hot to stay in this room - let's find somewhere cooler, (not ...very hot...)

   However, in informal spoken English, particularly in negative sentences, we can sometimes use
   'too' to mean roughly the same as 'very':

   - • I'm not too/very bothered about who wins.
   - • It's not too/very warm today, is it?

   Very and very much
   We don't use very before verbs, but we can use very much before some verbs to emphasise how
   we feel about things:

   - • I very much agree with the decision, (not ...very agree...)
   - • We (very) much enjoyed having you stay with us. (not ...very enjoyed...)

   ^Verbs like this include agree, doubt, fear, hope, like, want; and also admire, appreciate, enjoy,
   *and regret. We can use very much or much (but not very) before the last four verbs.
   We can use very but not (very) much before participle adjectives (see Unit 85):

   - • She was very disturbed to hear the news, (not She was very much disturbed...)
   - • It's very disappointing, (not It's very much disappointing.)

   However, we use (very) much but not very before a past participle which is part of a passive:

   - • The new by-pass was (very) much needed.

   Extremely, very, etc.; absolutely, completely, etc.
   We usually use extremely, very, etc. with gradable adjectives and absolutely, completely, etc.
   with ungradable adjectives (see Unit 83). Here are more adverbs like these and adjectives which
   commonly follow them:
   + gradable adjective
   extremely...effective, difficult, hard
   dreadfully...angry, disappointed, sorry
   hugely...entertaining, enjoyable, successful
   + ungradable adjective
   absolutely...clear, necessary, sure, true
   simply...awful, enormous, terrible
   utterly...exhausted, unbearable, unrecognisable
   Quite
   Quite has two meanings: to a particular degree, but not 'very' (= 'fairly'); and to a large degree,
   or 'very much' (= 'completely'). Compare:

   - • I was quite satisfied with the result. (= 'fairly') and
   - • No, you're quite wrongl (= 'completely')

   When quite is used with ungradable adjectives it means 'completely':

   - • 'Ted isn't coming until tomorrow.' 'Are you quite certain}'

   Comment adverbs
   Some comment adverbs...
   indicate how likely we think
   something is.
   indicate our attitude to or
   opinion of what is said.
   show our judgement of
   someone's actions.
   examples
   apparently, certainly, clearly, definitely, in theory, obviously,
   presumably, probably, undoubtedly
   astonishingly, frankly, generally, honestly, to be honest,
   interestingly (enough), luckily, naturally, in my opinion,
   personally, sadly, seriously, surprisingly, unbelievably
   bravely, carelessly, foolishly, generously, kindly, rightly,
   stupidly, wisely, wrongly
   Most common comment adverbs can occur at the front, middle or end of a sentence:

   - • Personally, I'd be surprised if Symons is guilty.
   - • He led me to a room that had obviously been built later than the rest of the house.
   - • The book was based on his experience in China, apparently.

   There are other possible positions for each of the comment adverbs in this examples. To show
   that they apply to the whole sentence, we usually separate them from the rest of the sentence,
   particularly in front and end positions, by a comma in writing or by intonation in speech.
   A number of phrases and clauses can be used in a similar way to comment adverbs to indicate
   our attitude to, or opinion of, what is said. For example:
   To my disappointment, he didn't ask me
   why I was wearing a false nose. (Also To
   my surprise/astonishment, etc.)
   To be frank, I don't think she's the best
   person to do the job. (Also To be
   honest/truthful/fair, etc.)
   Oddly enough, she didn't mention that she
   was moving house. (Also Curiously/
   Funnily/Strangely enough)
   To put it simply (or Putting it simply), we
   need to spend less. (Also To put it
   (or Putting it) bluntly/briefly/mildly, etc.)
   Viewpoint adverbs
   We use these adverbs to make it clear from what point of view we are speaking:

   - • Financially, the accident has been a disaster for the owners of the tunnel.
   - • The brothers may be alike physically, but they have very different personalities.

   Other examples include biologically, chemically, environmentally, ideologically, logically,
   morally, outwardly, politically, technically, visually.
   A number of phrases are used in a similar way: morally speaking, in political terms,
   from a technical point of view, as far as the environment is concerned, etc.
   Focus adverbs: even, only and alone
   Even and only usually go in mid position (see Unit 90), but if they refer to the subject they
   ' come before it. Compare:
   O • My mother has only brought some food. (= She hasn't brought anything else) and

   - • • Only my mother has brought some food. (= my mother and nobody else) (not My mother only...)
   - • Even Sue can speak French. (= you might not expect her to) (not Sue even...) and
   - • Sue can even speak French. (= in addition to everything else she can do)

   When we use alone to mean 'only', it comes after a noun:

   - • It isn't possible to become a great artist by hard work alone. (= other things are needed)

   Here are some general rules to help you decide what verb tense to use in an adverbial clause
   beginning with after, as, as soon as, before, until, when, or while.
   to talk about the present or past, use the same tense you would use in a main clause:

   - • I normally look after the children while she is practising.
   - • When she heard the results she was overjoyed.

   to talk about the future, use a present tense:

   - • Wait here until you're ready to go.
   - • I'll look after the children while you are making dinner.
   - • to talk about an action that is completed before another action described in the main

   clause, use either simple or perfect tenses:
   O • As soon as you see / have seen her, come and tell me.

   - • • She wrote to me after she spoke / had spoken to Jim.

   However, if we are talking about an action in the adverbial clause that takes place over a
   period of time, we generally prefer the present perfect:

   - • After I have written this book, I'm having a holiday, (rather than After I write...)
   - • You can go when you've typed these letters, (rather than ...when you type...)

   If the two actions take place at the same time, use a simple tense, not a perfect tense:

   - • Turn the light out as you leave, (not ...as you have left.)
   - • When I saw Kim, I asked her over for dinner, (not When I had seen...)

   IB
   Bef ore and until
   We use before if the action or event in the main clause has little or no duration and does not
   take place until the time represented in the adverbial clause:

   - • She walked out before I had a chance to explain.

   We can often use either until or before when a situation described in the main clause lasts until a
   time indicated in the adverbial clause. In particular:

   - • to say how far away a future event is: • It was three days until/before the letter arrived.
   - • if the main clause is negative: • I didn't think I'd like skiing until/before I tried it.

   Compare the use of until and before when the main clause is positive:

   - • He used to live with us until/before he moved down to London.

   Here, until means 'up to the time'. Before means 'at some time before (but not necessarily right
   up to the time specified)'. If the adverbial clause also describes the result of an action in the main
   clause, we use until:

   - • He cleaned his shoes until they shone, ('shining' is the result of 'cleaning')

   Hardly, no sooner, scarcely
   When we say that one event happened immediately after another we can use sentences with
   hardly, no sooner, and scarcely:

   - • The concert had hardly begun before all the lights went out.
   - • I had no sooner lit the barbecue than it started to rain.

   We often use a past perfect in the clause with hardly, no sooner or scarcely and a simple past in
   the second clause. After hardly and scarcely the second clause begins with when or before; after
   no sooner it begins with than. In a literary style, we often use the word order hardly / no sooner /
   scarcely + verb + subject at the beginning of the first clause (see Unit 120):

   - • Scarcely had Mrs James stepped into the classroom when the boys began fighting.

   We can use as, when or while to mean 'during the time that...', to talk about something that is
   or was happening when something else took place:

   - • As/When/While Dave was eating, the doorbell rang, or
   - • The doorbell rang, as/when/while Dave was eating.

   The word whilst can also be used in this way, but is today considered rather literary.
   We use when (not as or while):

   - • to talk about an event that takes place at the same time as some longer action or event

   (described in the main clause):

   - • They were playing in the garden when they heard a scream.
   - • Dave was eating when the doorbell rang, (compare A)
   - • to talk about one event happening immediately after another:
   - • When the lights went out, I lit some candles.
   - • I knew there had been an accident when the police arrived.
   - • to talk about periods of our lives or periods of time past:
   - • His mother called him Robbie when he was a baby.
   - • to mean 'every time':
   - • I still feel tired when I wake up in the morning.
   - • When I turn on the TV, smoke comes out the back.

   We use either as or when (not while):

   - • to talk about two short events that happen at the same moment, or if we want to emphasise

   that two events that in fact occur one after the other happen almost at exactly the same time,
   particularly if one causes the other:

   - • You'll see my house on the right as/when you cross the bridge.
   - • As/When the can is opened, the contents heat automatically.
   - • when we want to say that when one thing changes, another thing changes at the same time.

   However, we prefer as to express this meaning:

   - • As the cheese matures, its flavour improves, (rather than When the cheese matures...)
   - • Her eyesight worsened as she grew older, (rather than ...when she grew older.)

   We prefer while or as (rather than when):
   »• to talk about two longer actions that go on at the same time:
   » • I went shopping while/as Linda cleaned the house.
   We use while (or when) rather than as if 'as' could also mean 'because':

   - • While you were playing golf, I went to the cinema. ('As you were playing golf...' could mean

   'Because you were playing golf...')
   Particularly in formal speech and writing, we can often leave out subject + be in clauses with
   when and while if the main and subordinate clause refer to the same subject:

   - • The President was on holiday in Spain when told the news. (= when he was told)
   - • When in doubt about taking the medicine, consult your doctor. (= when you are in doubt)
   - • Mr Thomas found the coins while digging in his back garden. (= while he was digging)

   As, because, seeing that/as, since
   We can begin a clause with these words to give a reason for a particular situation:

   - • As it was getting late, I decided I should go home.
   - • We must be near the beach, because / can hear the waves.
   - • Since he was going to be living in Sweden for some time, he thought he should read

   something about the country.

   - • We could go and visit Sue, seeing that we have to drive past her house anyway.

   Notice that:

   - • It is also common and acceptable for because to begin a sentence, as in:
   - • Because everything looked different, I had no idea where to go.
   - • To give reasons in spoken English, we most often use because (often spoken as 'cos'). So is

   also commonly used to express the same meaning. Compare:

   - • Because my mother's arrived, I won't be able to meet you on Thursday after all.
   - • My mother's arrived, so I won't be able to meet you on Thursday after all.
   - • With this meaning, since is rather formal:
   - • I didn't go out because I was feeling awful, ('since' is unlikely in an informal context)
   - • Seeing that is used in informal English. Some people also use seeing as in informal speech:
   - • He just had to apologise, seeing that/as he knew he'd made a mistake.

   For, in that, inasmuch as
   We also give reasons with these phrases in formal or literary written English:

   - • We must begin planning now, for the future may bring unexpected changes.
   - • The film is unusual in that there are only four actors in it.
   - • Clara and I have quite an easy life, inasmuch as neither of us has to work too hard but we

   earn quite a lot of money.
   Because of, due to, owing to
   These prepositions can also be used to give a reason for something. Because of is used before a
   noun or noun phrase:

   - • We won't be able to come because of the weather.
   - • The Prime Minister returned home because of growing unrest in the country.

   Compare:

   - • We were delayed because there was an accident, (not ...because of there was...) and
   - • We were delayed because of an accident, (not ...because an accident.)

   Due to and owing to also mean 'because of:

   - • She was unable to run owing to/due to a leg injury. (= because of a leg injury.)
   - • We have less money to spend owing to/due to budget cuts. (= because of budget cuts.)

   Most people avoid using owing to after the verb be:

   - • The company's success is largely due to the new director, (not ...owing to...)

   For and with
   We can use for and with to introduce reasons. For has a similar meaning to 'because of:

   - • She was looking all the better for (= because of) her stay in hospital.

   With this meaning, for is common in most styles of English. (Compare B above.) With has a
   similar meaning to 'because there is/are':

   - • With so many people ill (= because so many people are ill), I've decided to cancel the meeting.

   Notice we can use with, but not for, at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a reason.

   In order / so as + to-infinitive
   To talk about the PURPOSE of something we can use in order / so as + to-infinitive:

   - • He took the course in order to get a better job.
   - • Trees are being planted by the roadside so as to reduce traffic noise.

   In spoken English in particular it is much more common simply to use a to-infinitive without 'in
   order' or 'so as' to express the same meaning:

   - • He took the course to get a better job.

   To make a negative sentence with in order / so as + to-infinitive, we put not before the to-infinitive:

   - • He kept the speech vague in order not to commit himself to one side or the other.
   - • The land was bought quickly so as not to delay the building work.

   You can't use a negative if you use only a to-infinitive:

   - • I carried the knife carefully in order / so as not to cut myself, (not ...carefully not to cut...)

   However, compare negative sentences with in order / so as / to-infinitive + but:

   - • I came to see you not (in order / so as) to complain, but (in order /so as) to apologise.

   In order that and so that
   We also use in order that and so that to talk about PURPOSE. Compare:

   - • She stayed at work late in order / so as to complete the report, and
   - • She stayed at work late in order that / so that she could complete the report.

   So that is more common than in order that, and is used in less formal situations.
   Study these examples. Notice in particular the verbs and tenses:

   - • Advice is given in order that / so that students can choose the best courses.
   - • Did you give up your job in order that / so that you could take care of your mother?
   - • She bid the present in order that / so that the children wouldn't find it.

   For
   Study these examples with for or to-infinitive used to talk about PURPOSE:
   I
   to talk about the purpose of an action:
   for + noun or to-infinitive
   to talk about the purpose of a thing,
   or to define it: for + -ing
   to talk about the use a person makes
   of something: to-infinitive

   - • I'm saving for a new car.
   - • I'm saving to buy a new car.
   - • This is good for getting rid of headaches.
   - • A mouse is a device used for moving the

   cursor around a computer screen.

   - • She used a heavy book to keep the door open.

   So...that
   We use so...that to link a CAUSE with a RESULT. In speech, 'that' is often left out:

   - • The train was so slow (that) I was almost two hours late.
   - • It all happened so quickly (that) I never got a good look at his face.

   For special emphasis, particularly in formal English, we can put So ... that at the beginning of a
   sentence and put the verb before the object (see also Unit 120):

   - • So slow was the train that I was almost two hours late.
   - • So quickly did it all happen that I never got a good look at his face.

   We can sometimes use so...as + to-infinitive instead of so...that:

   - • It was so unusual as to seem almost a joke. (= ...so unusual that it seemed almost...)

   Although and though
   We use although or though when we want to say that there is an unexpected contrast between
   what happened in the main clause and what happened in the adverbial clause:
   a • Although/Though Reid failed to score himself, he helped Jones score two goals, (or Reid

   - • failed to score himself, but he helped Jones score two goals.)
   - • She bought a car, although/though she was still too young to learn to drive, (or She was still

   too young to learn to drive, but she bought a car.)
   We can usually use either although or though, but though is often less formal. Though, but not
   although, can also be used as an adverb to say that the information in a clause contrasts with
   information in a previous sentence (see also Unit 103):

   - • I eat most dairy products. I'm not keen on yoghurt, though, (not ...although.)
   - • 'That cheese smells awful!' 'It tastes good, though, doesn't it?' (not ...although...)

   We can give special emphasis to an adjective or adverb by putting it before though or as,
   especially when followed by a linking verb such as be, appear, become, look, seem, sound,
   prove, etc. Notice that in this pattern you can't use although. Compare:

   - • Although/Though the night air was hot, they slept soundly, and
   - • Hot though (or as) the night air was, they slept soundly, (not Hot although the night air...)
   - • Although/Though it may seem extraordinary, London had less rain than Rome, and
   - • Extraordinary though (or as) it may seem, London had less rain than Rome, (not

   Extraordinary although it may seem...)
   Much as is used in a similar way before a clause, particularly to talk about how we feel about
   someone or something:

   - • Much as I enjoyed the holiday, I was glad to be home. (= Although I enjoyed...)

   Even though and even if
   We can use even though (but not 'even although') to mean 'despite the fact that' (see also Unit
   103) and even if to mean 'whether or not'. Compare:

   - • Even though Tom doesn't

   speak Spanish, I think he
   should still visit Madrid.

   - • Even if Tom doesn't

   speak Spanish, I think he
   should still visit Madrid.
   = Despite the fact that he
   doesn't speak Spanish
   = Whether or not he speaks
   Spanish
   i.e. The speaker knows that
   Tom doesn't speak Spanish
   i.e. The speaker doesn't
   know definitely whether
   Tom speaks Spanish or not
   In spite of and despite
   We can use in spite of + -ing with a similar meaning to 'although':

   - • In spite of playing with ten men, we won easily. (= Although we played with ten men...)
   - • In spite of being full of water, the boat sailed on. (= Although the boat was full...)

   In spite of can also be followed by a noun:

   - • In spite of their poverty, the children seemed happy. (= Although they were poor...)

   oNotice that despite is often used instead of in spite of, particularly in written English:

   - • • Despite falling / In spite of falling midway through the race, she won.

   Despite and in spite of are never followed by a clause with a finite verb. So, for example, you
   can't say 'Despite / In spite of she fell midway through the race...'. However, you can use a
   clause with a finite verb after the fact that:

   - • Despite / In spite of the fact that she fell midway through the race, she won.

   Even though and even so => Illllllliki

   C o n d i t i o n a l s e n t e n c e s ( 1 ) : v e r b t e n s e s
   Some conditional clauses beginning with if suggest that a situation is real - that is, the situation
   is or was true, or may have been or may become true:

   - • If anyone phones, tell them I'll be back at 11.00.
   - • If you really want to learn Italian, you need to spend some time in Italy.

   Others suggest that a situation is unreal - that is, the situation is imaginary or untrue:

   - • What would you do if you won the lottery?
   - • If you had started out earlier, you wouldn't have been so late.

   Compare:

   - • If I go to Berlin, I'll travel by train. (= real conditional) and
   - • If I went to Berlin, I'd travel by train. (= unreal conditional)

   In the first, the speaker is thinking of going to Berlin (it is a real future possibility), but in the
   second, the speaker is not thinking of doing so. The second might be giving someone advice.
   Real conditionals
   In real conditionals we use tenses as in other kinds of sentences: we use present tenses to talk
   about the present or unchanging relationships, and past tenses to talk about the past:

   - • If you leave now, you'll be home in two hours. • If water is frozen, it expands.
   - • If I made the wrong decision then I apologise.

   However, when we talk about the future, we use a present tense, not will (see Unit 100):

   - • I'll give you a lift if it rains, (not ...if it will rain...)

   Unreal conditionals
   In unreal conditionals, to talk about present or future situations, we use a past tense (either
   simple or continuous) in the if-clause and would + bare infinitive in the main clause:

   - • If my grandfather was/were still alive, he would be a hundred today.
   - • If you were driving from London to Glasgow, which way would you go?
   - • I'd (=would) offer to give you a lift if I had my car here.

   Notice that we sometimes use if...were instead of if...was (see Unit 100).
   When we talk about something that might have happened in the past, but didn't, then we use if
   + past perfect and would have + past participle in the main clause:
   ) • If I had known how difficult the job was, I wouldn't have taken it.
   * • If she hadn't been ill, she would have gone to the concert.
   In unreal conditionals, we can also use could/might/should (have) instead of would (have):

   - • If I lived out of town, I could take up gardening.
   - • They might have found a better hotel if they had driven a few more kilometres.

   In some unreal conditionals we use mixed tenses. That is, a past tense in the if-clause and would
   have + past participle in the main clause, or a past perfect in the if-clause and would + bare
   infinitive in the main clause:

   - • If Bob wasn't so lazy, he would have passed the exam easily.
   - • If the doctor had been called earlier, she would still be alive today.

   Notice that in unreal conditional sentences:

   - • we don't use the past simple or past perfect in the main clause:
   - • If we were serious about pollution, we would spend more money on research, (not ...we

   spent... or ...we had spent...).

   - • we don't use would in an if-clause (but see Unit 100):
   - • If I had a more reliable car, I'd drive to Spain rather than fly. (not If I would have...)

   I
   In unreal conditionals we use if...were + to-infinitive to talk about imaginary future situations:

   - • If the technology were to become available, we would be able to expand the business.
   - • If he were to have a chance of success, he would need to move to London.

   However, notice that we can't use this pattern with many verbs that describe a state, including
   know, like, remember, understand:

   - • If I knew they were honest, I'd gladly lend them the money, (not If I were to know...)

   We sometimes use this pattern to make a suggestion sound more polite:

   - • If you were to move over, we could all sit on the sofa.

   If the first verb in a conditional if-clause is should, were, or had (see Unit 99) we can leave out if
   and put the verb at the start of the clause. We do this particularly in formal or literary English
   (see also Unit 119):

   - • Should any of this cost you anything, send me the bill. (= If any of this should cost...)
   - • It would be embarrassing, were she to find out the truth. (= ...if she were to find out...)
   - • Had they not rushed Dan to hospital, he would have died. (= If they hadn't rushed Dan...)

   We use if it was/were not for + noun to say that one situation is dependent on another situation
   or on a person. When we talk about the past we use If it had not been for + noun:

   - • If it wasn't/weren't for Vivian, the conference wouldn't be going ahead.
   - • If it hadn't been for my parents, I would never have gone to university.

   In formal and literary language we can also use Were it not for... and Had it not been for...:

   - • Were it not for Vivian... • Had it not been for my parents...

   We often use but for + noun with a similar meaning:

   - • But for Jim's support, I wouldn't have got the job. (= If it hadn't been for Jim...)

   We don't usually use if...will in conditional sentences (see Unit 99). However, we can use if...will
   when we talk about a result of something in the main clause. Compare:

   - • Open a window if it will help you to sleep. or ...if it helps you to sleep.

   ('Helping you to sleep' is the result of opening the window.)

   - • I will be angry if it turns out that you are wrong. not '...if it will turn out...'

   ('Turning out that you are wrong' is not the result of being angry.)
   We also use if...will in requests:

   - • If you will take your seats, ladies and gentlemen, we can begin the meeting.

   If you want to make a request more polite, you can use if...would:

   - • If you would take your seats, ladies and gentlemen...

   In a real conditional sentence, we use if...happen to, if...should, or if...should happen to to talk
   about something which may be possible, but is not very likely. If...happen to is most common in
   spoken English:

   - • If you happen to be in our area, drop in and see us. (or If you should (happen to) be...)

   Notice that we don't usually use this pattern in unreal conditionals which talk about impossible
   states or events in the if-clause:

   - • If the North Sea froze in winter, you could walk from London to Oslo, [not If the North Sea

   happened to freeze / should (happen to) freeze in winter...)

   if ...not and unless
   Unless is used in conditional sentences with the meaning 'if...not':

   - • There's no chance of you getting the job unless you apply, (or ...if you don't apply.)
   - • You can't travel on this train unless you have a reservation, (or ...if you don't have...)

   With unless we use present tenses when we talk about the future:

   - • Unless it rains, I'll pick you up at 6.00. (not Unless it will rain...)

   In most real conditional sentences (see Unit 99), we can use either unless or if...not with a
   similar meaning. However, we use if...not but not unless:

   - • in most unreal conditional sentences:
   - • He would be happier if he didn't take things so seriously, (not ...unless he took...)
   - • If she hadn't gone to university, she would have gone into the police force, (not Unless she

   had gone...)

   - • when we talk about emotions:
   - • I'll be amazed if Christie doesn't win. (not ...unless Christie wins.)
   - • in most questions:
   - • If you don't pass the test, what will you do? (not Unless you pass...)

   We use unless but not if...not when we introduce an afterthought.

   - • Without Philip to run it, the course can't continue - unless you want the job, of course, (not

   ... - if you don't want...)
   In written English, the afterthought is often separated from the rest of the sentence by a dash.
   if and whether
   We can use if or whether to say that two possibilities have been talked about, or to say that
   people are not sure about something:

   - • They couldn't decide whether/if it was worth re-sitting the exam.
   - • I doubt whether/if anyone else agrees with me.

   Whether can usually be followed directly by or not. Compare:

   - • I didn't know if Tom was coming or not. (not ...if or not Tom was coming.) and
   - • I didn't know whether or not Tom was coming, (or ...whether Tom was coming or not.)

   We prefer whether rather than if:

   - • after the verbs advise, consider, discuss:
   - • You should consider carefully whether the car you are interested in is good value.
   - • before to-infinitives and after prepositions:
   - • I couldn't decide whether to buy apples or bananas.
   - • We argued about whether women are more liberated in Britain or the USA.
   - • in a clause acting as a subject or complement:
   - • Whether the minister will quit over the issue remains to be seen.
   - • The first issue is whether he knew he was committing a crime.
   - • in the pattern noun + as to + whether to mean 'about' or 'concerning':
   - • There was some disagreement as to whether he was eligible to play for France.

   Other nouns commonly used in this pattern are debate, discussion, doubt, question, uncertainty.
   These sentences include other words and phrases used to introduce conditional clauses:
   6) • We'll have the meeting this afternoon, provided/providing (that) no-one objects.

   - • Supposing (that) they ask me why I resigned from my last job - what should I say?
   - • I'll write to you every week - as/so long as you promise to reply.

   Study the use of the preposition + -ing form in these sentences:

   - • While understanding her problem, I don't know what I can do to help.
   - • After spending so much money on the car, I can't afford a holiday.

   We often use this pattern to avoid repeating the subject. Compare:

   - • Since moving to London, we haven't had time to go to the theatre, and
   - • Since we moved to London, we haven't had time to go to the theatre, (subject repeated)

   Words commonly used in this pattern include after, before, besides, by, in, on, since, through,
   while, with, without.
   We can sometimes use a passive form with being + past participle:

   - • Before being changed last year, the speed limit was 70 kph.
   - • He went to hospital after being hit on the head with a bottle.

   By, on, in +-ing

   - • By working hard, she passed her maths exam.
   - • They only survived by eating roots and berries in the forest.
   - • On returning from Beijing, he wrote to the Chinese embassy.
   - • John was the first person I saw on leaving hospital.
   - • In criticising the painting, I knew I would offend her.
   - • In choosing Marco, the party has moved to the left.

   = the method or means used
   = when
   = as a result of
   We can often use by + -ing or in + -ing with a similar meaning:

   - • In/By writing the essay about Spanish culture, I understood the country better. ('In

   writing...' = the result of writing was to understand...; 'By writing...' = the method I used to
   understand the country better was to write...)
   However, compare:

   - • By/In standing on the table, John was able to look out of the window. (= the result of the

   chosen method) and

   - • In standing (not By...) on the table, John banged his head on the ceiling. (= the result; John

   did not stand on the table in order to bang his head)
   With/without + -ing; what with + -ing
   With + -ing often gives a reason for something in the main clause. Notice that a subject has to
   come between with and -ing:

   - • With Louise living in Spain, we don't see her often. (= Because Louise lives in Spain...)
   - • With sunshine streaming through the window, Hugh found it impossible to sleep.

   (= Because sunshine was streaming...)
   In informal, mainly spoken, English, we can also use what with + -ing to introduce a reason.
   Notice that there doesn't have to be a subject between with and -ing:

   - • What with Philip snoring all night, and the heavy rain, I didn't sleep a wink.
   - • What with getting up early and travelling all day, we were exhausted by the evening.

   We can use without + ing to say that a second action doesn't happen:

   - • I went to work without eating breakfast. • They left without paying.

   Often, however, it has a similar meaning to 'although' or 'unless':
   > • Without setting out to do so, I have offended her. (= Although I didn't set out to do so...)

   - • Without seeing the pictures, I can't judge how good they are. (= Unless I see the pictures...)

   Some words (adverbs or prepositional phrases used as adverbs) are used to connect ideas
   between one sentence and a previous sentence or sentences:

   - • There was no heating in the building. As a result, the workers had to be sent home.
   - • We could go skiing at Christmas. Alternatively, we could just stay at home.

   Others (conjunctions or prepositions) are used to connect ideas within a single sentence:

   - • While I was waiting, I read a magazine.
   - • I'll be wearing a red jumper so that you can see me easily.

   Many words used to connect ideas between sentences can also connect two clauses in one
   sentence when they are joined with and, but, or, so, a semi-colon (;), colon (:), or dash (-):

   - • The building was extremely well constructed and, consequently, difficult to demolish.
   - • You could fly via Singapore; however, this isn't the only way.

   - • I arrived at New Street Station at 7.30. • We were waiting at the far end of the room.
   - • We last met at the conference in Italy. • There were very few people at Joan's party.

   such as a road or river:

   - • Is that a spider on the ceiling} (Notice we also say 'on the wall/floor')
   - • She owns a house on the Swan River.

   on a journey, and in when we see them as
   enclosed areas where we stayed for some time

   instead of an institution or event - here, the
   Edinburgh Festival; in suggests the city
   - staying or living there
   - a student at Manchester University
   - the name of a particular organisation
   - the kind of place
   - we use at to talk about buildings such as the

   inside the building
   - for travel using taxis and cars
   - for travel using bus, coach, plane, or train;

   9 We usually use at before an address and in or on before the name of a road:
   * • They've opened an office at 28 Lees Road. • The church is in/on Park Road.
   However, we sometimes use on instead of in when we talk about long streets or roads:

   - • The town is on the Pacific Highway.

   We can use at instead of in when we use a street name to refer to an institution in that street:

   - • There was an important meeting of ministers at Downing Street today.

   Acr oss, over, al ong, t hr ough
   We can use across or over to talk about a position on the other side of, or getting to the other
   side of a bridge, road, border, river, etc.:

   - • The truck came towards them across/over the bridge.
   - • Mike lives in the house across/over the road from ours.
   - • Once she was across/over the border, she knew she would be safe.

   We use over rather than across when we talk about reaching the other side of something that is
   high, or higher than it is wide:

   - • He hurt his leg as he jumped over the wall.
   - • The railway goes through a tunnel rather than over the top of the mountain.

   When we are talking about something we think of as a flat surface, or an area such as a country
   or sea, we use across rather than over:

   - • He suddenly saw Sue across the room.
   - • The programme was broadcast across Australia.
   - • The figures moved rapidly across the screen.

   Notice that we can say all over but not usually all across. Instead, we prefer right across:

   - • The disease has now spread all over the world, (or ...right across the world.)

   When we talk about following a line of some kind (a path, a road, a river, a beach, a canal, etc.),
   we use along.

   - • I'd seen them walking along the road past my window several times before.
   - • They walked along the footpath until they came to a small bridge.

   We use through to emphasise that we are talking about movement in a three dimensional space,
   with things all around, rather than a two dimensional space, a flat surface or area:

   - • He pushed his way through the crowd of people to get to her.
   - • He enjoyed the peace and quiet as he walked through the forest.

   Through often suggests movement from one side or end of the space to the other. Compare:

   - • She walked through the forest to get to her grandmother's house, and
   - • She spent a lot of her free time walking in the forest.

   Above, over; below, under
   We can use either above or over when we say that one thing is at a higher level than another:

   - • Above/Over the door was a sign saying, 'Mind your head'.
   - • She had painted thick, dark eyebrows above/over each eye.

   However, we use above, not over, when one thing is not directly over the other. Compare:

   - • The castle sat in the mountains above the town, and
   - • The passengers couldn't see the sun, as it was right over the plane. (= directly overhead)

   We use over, not above, when we say that something covers something else and is in contact
   with it, and also when we are talking about horizontal movement:

   - • A grey mist hung over the fields.
   - • I saw the helicopter fly out over the water, near the fishing boat.

   Below is the opposite of above; under is the opposite of over. The differences in the uses of
   below and under are similar to those between above and over (see above):

   - • It's hard to believe that there is a railway line below/under the building.
   - • Her head was below the level of the counter and the shop assistant didn't notice her.
   - • I was so hot, I stood under a cold shower for ten minutes.
   - • She hid the presents under a blanket, (the presents and the blanket are in contact)

   Between, among
   Study how between and among are used as prepositions of place in these sentences:

   - • She held the diamond between her thumb and forefinger.
   - • Zimbabwe is situated between Zambia to the north, Mozambique to the east, Botswana to

   p the west, and South Africa to the south.
   p • He stood among all his friends in the room and felt very happy.
   | i • She eventually found her passport among the clothes in her drawer.
   jj§ We use between with two or more people or things that we see as individual or separate. We use
   j|j among when we see the people or things as part of a group or mass. You can't say that you are
   jf among two people or things. Amongst is sometimes used instead of among, but is a more literary
   Jp- word.
   I D Between and among are not only used as prepositions of place. To talk about something done to
   jjis or by a group or groups of things or people, we can use either between or among:
   III • The money is to be divided between/among the towns in the area.
   pf • The prize will be shared between/among the first six finishers in the race.
   fe; However, when we specify the individual members of the group using singular nouns we use
   jj| r: between rather than among:
   §11 • The treaty was signed between Great Britain and France.
   |;> • There was a disagreement between Neil, John and Margaret.
   || We also use between, not among, when we talk about comparisons and relationships (e.g. a
   p difference between, a connection between..., a friendship between..., a link between...):
   lp • What are the differences between rugby league, rugby union and American football?
   Jl • They are wrong to claim that there is a connection between unemployment and crime.
   iff We use among, not between, when we mean 'occurring in', 'one/some of or 'out of:
   if • The disease has now broken out among the hill tribes. (= 'occurring in')
   !§ • They are among the best hockey players in the world. (= 'some of)
   jjl; • Among the capital cities of South America, Quito is the second highest. (= 'out of)
   lit?
   j§; Notice how we use the expression among other things (not 'between other things'):
   j? • Among other things, I enjoy painting and gardening.
   |j • I later found out that he had been a carpenter and a dustman, among other things.
   By, beside, close to, near (to), next (to)
   These all mean 'not far away'. We can often use either near (to) or close to:

   - • The plant often grows close to / near (to) the banks of rivers.
   - • We live close to / near (to) the city centre.

   We use beside, by, or next to to say that one thing or person is at the side of another:
   ty • Colin sat beside / by / next to her with his legs crossed.

   - • • I pushed the button beside / by / next to the door, but there was no answer.

   We can also use next as an adjective to say that something follows another thing in a series. When
   we mean that one thing is closer than any other thing of the same kind, we use nearest, not next.
   Compare:

   - • When Jim arrived, I left the kitchen and went into the next room, (not ...nearest room.) and
   - • When the storm started, I ran to the nearest house for shelter, (not ...next...)

   When we are talking about towns and cities we can use near, but not by:

   - • I first met Steve when he was working on a beach near Adelaide.
   - • They live in a pretty cottage near Bergerac in France.

   We use at with points of time or periods of time that we think of as points. We use at:

   - • with exact points of time:
   - • at midday at midnight at 3 o'clock at 8.15
   - • with short holiday periods, such as Christmas, Easter, the weekend, etc.:
   - • I'll see you at Easter. • We often go walking at the weekend.

   (In US and Australian English, 'on the weekend' is used, and this is now heard in informal
   British English, too.)

   - • with other short periods that we think of as points, such as the end of January, the beginning of

   the year, etc.:

   - • I get paid at the end of the month.
   - • with mealtimes, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.:
   - • That morning at breakfast, my brother told us he was getting married.
   - • with night when we mean 'when it is night' or 'each night':
   - • People can't go out on the streets at night any more, it's so dangerous.

   But notice that we use in with the middle of..., and that when we talk about a particular night
   we use in the night:

   - • It's Ann's birthday some time in the middle of May, I think.
   - • I felt very restless in the night and had to take a sleeping tablet.
   - • in the phrase at the moment (= now); but notice that we say in a moment (= in a short period of

   time):

   - • John's in Korea at the moment. • I'll be with you in a moment.

   We use in:

   - • when we talk about longer periods of time such as seasons (e.g. the spring), months, years,

   decades (e.g. the 1990's (or the 1990s)), centuries (e.g. the 16th century), and other periods
   such as the week before Easter, the hours before the exam, etc.:
   ) • In the winter you can only use the road with a four-wheel drive vehicle.

   - • • In the days that followed her operation, she spent a lot of time in bed.
   - • when we talk about how long it will be before something happens:

   - • when we say how long something takes:
   - • He learnt how to program the computer in just a matter of weeks. (= a few weeks)
   - • with parts of the day, such as the morning, the evening, etc. (see A for 'night'):
   - • Temperatures today should reach 25°C in the afternoon.

   (We can often use during instead of in when we talk about periods of time. See Unit 108.)
   We use on when we talk about a particular day, date, or part of a particular day:

   - • We're meeting again on Friday. • It's her birthday on the 21st.
   - • I get paid on the last day of the month. • We went to a party on Easter Sunday.
   - • I've got a meeting on Monday morning.

   We rarely use at, in or on before the words all, any, each, every, last, next, one, some, this, or
   that when these are followed by a time expression. Compare:

   - • I'll do it in the morning, and • He hasn't been here all morning, (not ...in all morning.)
   - • I'll see you again on Friday, and • I'm going to Oslo next Friday, (not ...on next Friday.)

   We don't use at, in or on before (the day after) tomorrow and (the day before) yesterday:

   - • The weather was beautiful yesterday, (not ...on yesterday.)

   We prefer What time...? rather than At what time...? except in very formal English.

   - • The population of the city has actually fallen during the last decade, (or ...in the last...)
   - • She didn't take a holiday during her four years as head of the company, (or ...in her four

   years...)

   - • During the time that I was in Paris, I only once saw the River Seine, (or In the time...)

   as another event or activity rather than over a particular period of time:

   - • Mrs Newton came into our classroom during a maths test.
   - • The President made the speech during a visit to Madrid.

   We also prefer during when we emphasise that something continues for the whole of a particular
   period of time:

   - • No-one was allowed to leave the ship during (the whole of) its time in port.

   We can also use throughout to express a similar meaning:

   - • We had enough firewood to keep us warm during (the whole of) the winter, (or...warm

   throughout the winter.)
   13 We can use over or during when we talk about an event or activity that goes on for a length of

   - • Weather conditions have been improving over/during the past few days.
   - • I fell, banged my head, and can't remember anything about what happened over/during the

   next hour or so.

   period of time, we prefer during:

   - • She sneezed during the performance, (not ...over the performance.)
   - • During a pause in the conversation, she left the room, (not Over a pause...)

   We use for to say how long something continues, and during to say when something takes place:

   - • I felt ill for a couple of days, but was fine after that, (not ...during...)
   - • About ten of us were taken ill during a party we were at in York, (not ...for a party...)
   - • You will get plenty of practical experience during the training period, (not ...for the training

   period...)
   By, until
   We use by when we say that something will
   happen or be achieved either before a
   particular time or at that time at the latest.

   - • We have to be at the stadium by 2.30.

   (That's when the competition starts.)

   - • She learned German by the age of 16.

   (She could speak it fluently when she

   - • We have to be at the stadium until 2.30.

   (We can't leave before that time.)

   - • She learned German until the age of 16.

   We can use but with a similar meaning to except (for), particularly after negative words such as
   no, nobody, and nothing:

   - • Immediately after the operation he could see nothing but / except (for) / apart from vague

   shadows.

   - • There was no way out but / except / apart from upwards, towards the light.

   But for has a different meaning from except for. When we use but for we introduce a negative
   idea, saying what might have happened if other things had not happened:

   - • The country would now be self-sufficient in food but for the drought last year. (= if it hadn't

   been for the drought...)

   - • But for his broken leg he would probably have been picked for the national team by now.

   (= if it hadn't been for his broken leg...)
   However, some people use except for in the same way as but for, particularly in spoken English.
   In formal writing it is better to use but for to introduce a negative idea and except for to
   introduce an exception.

   About and on
   We can use about and on to mean 'concerning' or 'on the subject of.
   We use about, not on after the verbs argue, complain, find out, joke, know, protest, quarrel,
   read, teach (someone), tell (someone), worry; ask, enquire/inquire, learn, think (see also Unit
   111); agree, hear, laugh (see also Unit 112); care, wonder (see also Unit 113); and after the
   nouns argument, chat, fuss, joke, letter, misunderstanding, quarrel:

   - • I didn't find out about Sara's illness until my brother telephoned me.
   - • Misunderstanding about the cause of malaria is common.

   We use on, not about, after the verbs comment, concentrate, focus, insist, reflect (= think):

   - • I found it difficult to concentrate on my homework with the football on TV.
   - • They insisted on seeing my passport, even though I was nowhere near the border.

   After some other verbs and nouns we can use either about or on. These include the verbs
   advise, agree, decide, disagree, lecture, speak, speculate, talk, write, and the nouns advice,
   agreement, book/article/paper, consultation, decision, idea, information, lecture, opinion,
   question:

   - • The press is starting to speculate about/on whether the minister can survive this time.
   - • There is little agreement about/on what caused the building to collapse.

   When we refer to formal or academic speech or writing, after the verbs and nouns in B we can
   use either about or on. However, we prefer about when we refer to more informal speech or
   writing. Compare:

   - • She spoke on the recent advances in teaching reading, (this suggests a formal speech such as

   a lecture; or ...spoke about...) and

   - • Jim and Anita seemed surprised when I spoke about buying their car. (this suggests an

   informal conversation; not '...spoke on...')

   - • We've been asked to study a book on the history of Norway, {or ...a book about...) and
   - • It's a book about three men and their dog on a boating holiday, {not ...a book on...)

   By and with
   We can use by and with to talk about how something is done. We use by (followed by a noun or
   -ing) when we talk about what action we take to do something; we use with (followed by a
   noun) when we talk about what we use to do something:

   - • He only avoided the children by braking hard and swerving to the right.
   - • She succeeded by sheer willpower.
   - • I didn't have a bottle opener, so I had to open it with a screwdriver.
   - • I told him that he couldn't hope to catch a big fish with a small rod like that.

   We use by in certain common phrases:

   - • I turned the computer off by mistake and lost all my work.

   Other phrases like this include by accident; by phone; by bus/car, etc.; by air/road/rail/
   land/sea; by cheque / credit card; by degrees/stages; by heart; by force; by hand; by post/fax/
   e-mail {or E-mail).
   However, if there is a determiner before the noun (e.g. a(n), the, this, that, my, her) or if the
   noun is plural, we use a preposition other than by. For example:

   - • I ordered it on the phone. • I learnt about it in an email from my boss.
   - • She turned up in her new car. • I never travel in buses.

   longer period:

   - • He suddenly thought of Hilary. Perhaps she would help, (rather than ...thought about...)
   - • We have been thinking about Jan and her problems for a while, (rather than ...thinking of...)

   - • He doesn't seem to care about the effect smoking has on him.

   care for We use care for to say that we look after someone or something and keep them in

   - • Jean cared for her disabled mother until her death last year, (or Jean took care of...)
   - • You need to consider how easy it will be to care for the garden, (or ...to take care of...)

   We also use care for to mean 'like', particularly in negative sentences, and to mean 'want' in
   offers. Both these uses of care for are rather formal:

   - • I don't care for the theatre much. • Would you care for a cup of coffee?

   care + no preposition We use care with no preposition before how, if, what, when, etc. to
   mean that something is (not) considered important or significant:

   - • • He often walks along the street singing loudly. He doesn't seem to care who is around.

   shout/point/throw at/to You shout at someone because you are angry with them:

   You shout to someone who is a long way from you so that they can hear:

   - • The taxi driver shouted to someone across the street. 'Is the station near here?'

   We use point something at when we aim a knife, camera, finger, etc. in a particular direction:

   - • She pointed the knife at me and started to laugh.

   When you point at or point to something, you show where something is by holding out your
   finger (we can also use point towards):

   - • The food's over there,' said Toni, pointing at/to/towards the corner of the room.

   We use point to when we say that a particular fact suggests that something else is true or will
   happen:

   - • The increase in house prices points to an upturn in the economy.

   We throw something to someone for them to catch it:

   - • Fletcher picked up the ball and threw it back to the goalkeeper.

   We throw something at something or someone to try to hit them:

   - • A monkey was sitting in the tree, throwing nuts at anyone who walked past.

   wonder about If we wonder about doing something, we think about doing it in the future, or
   say that we want to know about something or someone:
   a • I've been wondering about visiting Lynn.

   - • • John has looked tired recently, and I've started to wonder about his health.

   wonder at If we wonder at something, we say that we are surprised at it or impressed by it.

   Some verbs are commonly used with a particular particle (preposition or adverb). We can
   call these two-word verbs:

   - • She had to let out her dress because she'd put on weight. (= made it larger)
   - • The company's debts were mounting up. (= increasing)
   - • Tommy's fallen over again. Can you help him up?

   A good dictionary will tell you if a particle is a preposition or adverb and explain the meaning of
   two- and three-word verbs.
   Some verbs are commonly used with an adverb + preposition. These are three-word verbs:

   - • Do you think he's really likely to go through with his threat? (= do it)
   - • They'd sold out of washing powder at the supermarket. (= it had all been sold)

   These two- and three-word verbs are sometimes called 'phrasal' and 'prepositional' verbs. It is
   often difficult to understand what they mean from the meaning of their separate parts.
   Verb + particle + noun phrase
   1 With some two-word verbs (verb + preposition), the noun phrase goes after the particle:

   - • I'm afraid that Simon met with an accident as he was driving home.
   - • The back door opens onto a small garden.

   2 With other two-word verbs (verb + adverb), a noun phrase usually goes after the particle
   unless the noun phrase is a pronoun:

   - • She followed out the instructions exactly, (rather than ...followed the instructions out...)
   - • She read the instructions and followed them out precisely, (not ...followed out them...)

   Verb + noun phrase + particle
   With a few two-word verbs (verb + adverb), a noun phrase is usually placed or must be placed
   before the particle:

   - • She told the children off for stealing her apples, (rather than ...told off the children...)
   - • Don't forget to pull the door to (/tu:/) when you go out. (not ...pull to the door...)

   Verb + particle + noun phrase or verb + noun phrase + particle
   With some two-word verbs (verb + adverb), a noun phrase can go either before the particle or
   after it. Compare:

   - • Buying the new car has eaten up all my savings, or
   - • Buying the new car has eaten all my savings up.

   However, we use verb + noun phrase + particle when the noun phrase is a pronoun:

   - • Pam had to get rid of her car, and she sold it off at a very low price, (not ...sold off it...)
   - • I won't be able to go to the party. You'll have to count me out. (not ...count out me.)

   and we prefer verb + particle + noun phrase when the noun phrase is long. Compare:

   - • She had to clean the kitchen up. (or ...clean up the kitchen.) and
   - • She had to clean up the mess on the kitchen floor, (rather than ...clean the mess ...up.)

   Verb + adverb + preposition + noun phrase
   1 With most three-word verbs, the noun phrase goes after the preposition:

   - • The government is to cut back on spending on the armed forces.
   - • He really looks up to his older brother.

   2 However, a few three-word verbs have the noun phrase immediately after the verb. A second
   noun phrase will go after the preposition:

   - • I helped Lucy on with her coat. (= helped her to put it on)
   - • She tried to talk me out of the plan. (= persuade me not to do it)

   T h e r e i s , t h e r e w a s , e t c .
   When we introduce a new person or thing into what we are saying - to say that this person or
   thing exists, happens, or is to be found in a particular place - we can use a sentence beginning
   There + be. In these cases, there is not stressed:
   n • There was a loud bang from upstairs, (not A loud bang was from upstairs.)

   - • • I can't contact Nina. There must be something wrong with her phone, (not It must be...)
   - • There's a woman outside to see you. (rather than A woman is outside to see you.)

   We also use this pattern in questions to ask about the existence etc. of people and things:

   - • Is there anybody in here?

   Because we use there in this way to introduce topics, the noun following there + be often has an
   indefinite meaning. So we often use indefinite or non-specific words like a/an, any(one),
   some(thing), no(body), etc. with the noun rather than words like the, this, my, your, or a name,
   which give the noun a more definite or specific meaning. Compare:

   - • There's nobody here to see you.
   - • There was something strange about the way he smiled, and
   - • The cat was in the kitchen, (rather than There was the cat in the kitchen.)
   - • Sam is waiting for me outside, (rather than There is Sam waiting for me outside.)

   If we do use there + be + the, this is often done to show a change of topic. Choosing the, that,
   etc. + noun indicates that we think the topic is already known to the hearer or reader:

   - • ... Alternatively, there is the choice to vote against the planned changes.
   - • ... And then there is the question of who is going to pay.

   I
   If the noun after be is singular, the verb is singular; if the noun is plural, the verb is plural:

   - • There is a very good reason for my decision.
   - • There were too many people trying to get into the football stadium.

   However, in informal speech we sometimes use there is before a plural noun:

   - • 'Anything to eat?' 'Well, there's some apples on the table.'

   If the noun phrase consists of two or more nouns in a list, we use a singular verb if the first noun
   is singular or uncountable, and a plural verb if the first noun is plural:

   - • When I opened the fridge there was only a bottle of milk, some eggs, and butter.
   - • When I opened the fridge there were only some eggs, a bottle of milk, and butter.

   We can use there + be + noun before a that-c\ause or w/?-clause:

   - • Is there a chance (that) Delia could arrive this afternoon?
   - • There is no reason (why) I can't see you tomorrow.

   We can also use this pattern with a relative clause, giving information about the noun:

   - • There isn't anything (that) you can do to help, I'm afraid.
   - • There was a small stream which/that ran at the bottom of the garden.

   Notice that we don't usually leave out the relative pronoun when it is followed by a finite verb.
   So we can't say 'There was a small stream ran at the bottom...'. However, we can say:

   - • There was a small stream running at the bottom of the garden, (with a non-finite verb)

   and in informal spoken English, some people leave out the relative pronoun before a verb:

   - • There was a man (who) phoned about half eleven.

   In formal English we can use a clause with there being to introduce a reason for something:

   - • There being no evidence against him, Slade was released. (= Because there was no evidence

   against him...)

   - • There being no reports of adverse reactions, the drug is to be made more widely available.

   There's no...

   Instead of using a tbat-clause, u^-clause, to-infinitive clause, or //-clause as the subject of the
   sentence, we usually (and always with an //-clause) prefer to use a pattern with it + be +
   adjective/noun + clause. Compare:

   - • It is an honour that Professor Bolt is

   attending the conference.

   - • It is clear why Don decided to leave Spain.
   - • It's very enjoyable to sing in a choir.
   - • It will be surprising //the two countries

   don't reach an agreement soon.
   These sentences are less formal.

   - • That Professor Bolt is attending the

   conference is an honour.

   - • Why Don decided to leave Spain is dear.
   - • To sing in a choir is very enjoyable.

   These sentences are rather formal.
   Using an it... pattern allows us to put these clauses at the end of the sentence, which is the usual
   place in English for information that is important or new.
   In written English we don't usually use an it... pattern instead of sentences which begin with a
   noun as subject:

   - • Their success was unexpected, (not It was unexpected their success.)

   However, in spoken English this is quite common:

   - • It tastes really good, this new ice cream.

   We can use a similar pattern with it + verb + (object) + clause using a verb other than be:

   - • It helps to have a very sharp knife when you prepare fish.
   - • It didn't surprise me when Pete left the company.

   Some verbs are often used with it + verb + (object) + that-dause. Compare:
   It + verb + (object) + that-clause

   - • It worried me that she drove so fast.
   - • It turned out that the bike didn't belong to him.

   Alternative pattern

   - • I was worried that she drove so fast.

   X
   Other verbs, such as worry, with an alternative pattern include amaze, annoy, bother, concern,
   frighten, please, surprise. Other verbs, such as turn out, with no alternative pattern include
   appear, come about, emerge, follow, happen, seem, transpire.
   Some verbs are commonly used with an it...pattern when they are in the passive and followed by
   a that-c\aust, ^-clause, or to-infinitive clause:

   - • It was agreed that the match should be postponed, (not That the match ... was agreed.)
   - • It is being asked why no action is to be taken, (not Why no action ... is being asked.)
   - • It was decided to celebrate his 75th birthday, (not To celebrate ... was decided.)

   Verbs like this followed by a that-c\ausz include accept, agree, believe, decide, expect, hope,
   intend, plan, think, understand; verbs followed by a w^-clause include ask, decide, determine,
   establish, know, understand; verbs followed by a to-infinitive clause include agree, decide, hope,
   intend, plan. Some verbs can be followed by more than one type of clause.
   We can use it with take when we say what is or was needed in a particular activity; for example,
   the amount of time needed, or the resources or characteristics needed. Compare:

   - • It took the men a week to mend our roof, and • The men took a week to mend our roof.
   - • It takes a lot of effort to play the flute well, and • A lot of effort is needed to play the flute

   well.

   We can use a pattern with it... as the object of a verb. It refers forward to a clause that comes
   after. It can sometimes be followed directly by a that-, wh-, or z/-clause, particularly after verbs
   to do with '(not) liking' such as enjoy, hate, like, love, don't mind, resent:

   - • I hate it that you can swim so well and I can't, (not I hate that you can swim...)
   - • We always like it when you stay with us. (not We always like when you...)

   Notice that many other verbs that can be followed by a that-c\ause or w^-clause are not
   used with it... in this way, including accept, discover, notice, predict, regret, remember:

   - • On the train she discovered where she had put her ticket, (not ...discovered it where...)
   - • He finally accepted that he would never become a doctor, (not ...accepted it that...)

   With other verbs used to indicate how we see a particular event or situation, it is followed first
   by a noun or adjective and then a that-c\ause, wh-c\ause, or to-infinitive clause. Verbs
   commonly used in this way include believe, consider, find (= discover something from
   experience), feel, think:

   - • Officials have said they believe it unlikely that any lasting damage to the environment has

   been done, (not ...they believe unlikely that...)

   - • I thought it a waste of money to throw away the food, (not I thought a waste of money to...

   When we use leave and owe with it... we can use to (somebody) + to-infinitive after it:

   - • Don't bother to arrange anything. Just leave it to me to sort out.
   - • She owed it to her parents to do well at college. (= had a responsibility to them)

   With the verbs accept, regard, see, take, or view we use it + as + noun (or adjective) + clause:

   - • We see (it)as an insult to have received no reply to our letter.
   - • I thoughtrTwas a very ordinary butterfly, but Tom regarded @as extraordinary riiat we

   should have seen it. """""

   - • I take (jt) as encouraging when students attend all my lectures.

   I Focusing with //-clauses
   We can use an ff-clause to focus attention on certain information. Compare:

   - • 'Helen bought the car from Tom.' 'No, it was Tom that bought the car from Helen.'
   - • 'Helen bought her car last year.' 'No, it was two years ago that Helen bought the car.'
   - • 'Helen bought her car from Bob.' 'No, it was Tom that Helen bought the car from.'

   The information we want to emphasise comes after be and is followed by a clause usually
   beginning with that. We sometimes use which or who instead of that; when and where can also
   be used, but usually only in informal English; and how or why can't replace that:
   O • His parents were always there to help; it was to them that/who he now turned for support.

   - • • 'Sue's just arrived.' 'That's odd. It's usually on Thursday that/when she visits.'
   - • 'Was it by cutting staff that he managed to save the firm?' 'No, it was by improving

   distribution that he succeeded.' (not ...how he succeeded.)
   D Focusing with wftaf-clauses
   Compare the following sentences:

   - • We gave them some home-made ice cream, and
   - • What we gave them was some home-made ice cream.

   If we want to focus particular attention on certain information in a sentence, we sometimes use
   a what-clzuse. followed by be. The information we want to focus attention on is outside the
   what-dause. We often do this if we want to introduce a new topic; to give a reason, instruction
   or explanation; or to correct something that has been said or done. In the following examples,
   the information in focus is underlined:

   - • What I'd like you to work on is exercise two on page 38.
   - • Tim arrived two hours late: what had happened was that his bicycle chain had broken.
   - • 'We've only got this small bookcase - will that do?' 'No, what I was looking for was

   something much bigger and stronger.'
   We can often put the what-dause either at the beginning or the end of the sentence:

   - • What upset me most was his rudeness. or • His rudeness was what upset me most.

   To emphasise an action performed by someone, we use a sentence with what...do...:

   - • Dave lost his job and was short of money, so what he did was (to) sell his flat and move in

   with his brother.

   - • A: When the bookcase arrived, two shelves were broken.

   B: Did you send it back?
   A: No, what we did was (to) send them a letter of complaint.
   The pattern in this kind of sentence is what + subject + do + be + to-infinitive clause. (Notice
   that the 'to' in the infinitive can be omitted.)
   P We rarely use other w^-clauses (beginning how, when, where, who, why) in the same way.
   Instead, we prefer phrases instead of the w^-word. Here are some examples:

   - • The only reason (why/that) I left the party early was that I was feeling unwell.

   (rather than Why I left the party early was...)

   - • The place (where/that) you should play football is the playground, not the classroom.

   (rather than Where you should play football is...)

   - • The best way (in which/that) you can open the bottle is by putting it in hot water first.

   (rather than How you can open the bottle is...)

   - • Somebody (who/that) I enjoy reading is Peter Carey, (not Who I enjoy reading is...)
   - • The time (when/that) I work best is early morning, (rather than When I work best is...)

   Verb + wh-clauses = lt...(1)and(2)=>'
   EXERCISES
   Rewrite the sentences to focus attention on the underlined information. Start with it + be and an
   appropriate wh- word or that. (C)

   2 'Did you mean that you will give me the money?' (lend / money until next week)
   3 'Did you think that I would take Mark to piano practice?' (going / his own)

   4 'Did you go next door and complain about the noise?' (call / police)
   'No, what I did, was (to) call the police. 1
   5 'Did you buy a new washing machine?' (repair / old one)
   6 'Did you write a letter to the company?' (phone / managing director directly)
   7 'Did you stay with Keith for the New Year?' (invite him / my house instead)

   I n v e r s i o n ( 1 )
   A In statements it is usual for the verb to follow the subject. Sometimes, however, this word order
   is reversed. We can refer to this as INVERSION. Compare:

   - • Her father stood in the doorway. —* In the doorway stood her father.
   - • He had rarely seen such a sunset. —• Rarely had he seen such a sunset.
   - • He showed me his ID card. I only let him in then. —• Only then did / let him in.

   Notice how the subject comes after the verb (e.g. stood) or an auxiliary (e.g. had, did). Units 119
   and 120 study the circumstances in which inversion takes place. Some of these are also looked at
   in earlier units and brought together here.
   D Inversion after adverbial phrases of direction and place
   When we put an adverbial phrase, especially of direction or place, at the beginning of a sentence,
   we sometimes put an intransitive verb in front of its subject. This kind of inversion is found
   particularly in formal or literary styles:

   - • Dave began to open the three parcels. Inside the first was a book of crosswords from his

   Aunt Alice, (or, less formally Inside the first there was a book of crosswords...)
   With the verb be we always use inversion in sentences like this, and inversion is usual with
   certain verbs of place and movement, such as climb, come, fly, go, hang, lie, run, sit, stand:
   Sf • Above the fireplace was a portrait of the Duke, (not ...a portrait of the Duke was.)

   - • • In an armchair sat his mother, (rather than ...his mother sat.)

   Inversion doesn't usually occur with other verbs. We don't invert subject and verb when the
   subject is a pronoun. So, for example, we don't say 'In an armchair sat she.'
   P In speech, inversion often occurs after here and there, and adverbs such as back, down, in, off,
   oup, round, etc.:

   - • • Here comes Sandra's car. • I lit the fuse and after a few seconds up went the rocket.

   n Inversion in conditional sentences
   We can use clauses with inversion instead of certain kinds of z/-clauses. (See Unit 100.) Compare:

   - • It would be a serious setback, if the talks

   were to fail.

   - • If you should need more information,

   please telephone our main office.

   - • If Alex had asked, I would have been able

   to help.

   - • It would be a serious setback, were

   talks to fail.

   - • Should you need more information

   telephone our main office.

   - • Had Alex asked, I would have been

   to help.
   the
   please
   able
   The sentences with inversion are rather more formal than those with 'if. Notice that in negative
   clauses with inversion, we don't use contracted forms:

   - • Had he not resigned, we would have been forced to sack him. (not Hadn't he...)

   Inversion in comparisons with 'as' and 'than'

   - • The cake was excellent, as was the coffee, (or ...as the coffee was.)
   - • I believed, as did my colleagues, that the plan would work, (or ...as my colleagues did...)
   - • Research shows that children living in villages watch more television than do their

   counterparts in inner city areas, (or ...than their counterparts do...)
   We prefer to use inversion after as and than in formal written language. Notice that we don't
   invert subject and verb when the subject is a pronoun.

   Inversion after negative adverbials
   In formal and literary language in particular, we use negative adverbials at the beginning of a
   clause. The subject and verb are inverted:

   - • after the time adverbials never (before), rarely, seldom; barely/hardly/scarcely...when/before;

   no sooner...than:

   - • Seldom do we have goods returned to us because they are faulty, (not Seldom we do...)
   - • Hardly had / got onto the motorway when I saw two police cars following me.
   - • after only + a time expression, as in only after, only later, only once, only then, only when:
   - • She bought a newspaper and some sweets at the shop on the corner. Only later did she

   realise that she'd been given the wrong change.

   - • Only once did / go to the opera in the whole time I was in Italy.
   - • after only + other prepositional phrases beginning only by..., only in..., only with..., etc.:
   - • Only by chance had Jameson discovered where the birds were nesting.
   - • Mary had to work at evenings and weekends. Only in this way was she able to complete the

   report by the deadline.

   - • after expressions with preposition + no, such as at no time, in no way, on no account, under/in

   no circumstances:

   - • At no time did they actually break the rules of the game.
   - • Under no circumstances are passengers permitted to open the doors themselves.
   - • after expressions with not..., such as not only, not until, and also not + object:
   - • Not until August did the government order an inquiry into the accident.
   - • Not a single word had she written since the exam had started.
   - • after little with a negative meaning:
   - • Little do they know how lucky they are to live in such a wonderful house.
   - • Little did / then realise the day would come when Michael would be famous.

   Notice that inversion can occur after a clause beginning only after/if/when or not until:

   - • Only when the famine gets worse will world governments begin to act.
   - • Not until the train pulled into Euston Station did Jim find that his coat had gone.

   Inversion after 'so + adjective... that'; 'such + be...that'; 'neither.../nor...'
   Compare these pairs of sentences:

   - • Her business was so successful that Marie was able to retire at the age of 50. or
   - • So successful was her business, that Marie was able to retire at the age of 50.
   - • The weather conditions became so dangerous that all mountain roads were closed, or
   - • So dangerous did weather conditions become, that all mountain roads were closed.

   <j>We can use so + adjective at the beginning of a clause to give special emphasis to the adjective.
   *When we do this, the subject and verb are inverted.
   We can use such + be at the beginning of a clause to emphasise the extent or degree of
   something. The subject and verb are inverted. Compare:

   - • Such is the popularity of the play that the theatre is likely to be full every night, or
   - • The play is so popular that the theatre is likely to be full every night.

   We invert the subject and verb after neither and nor when these words begin a clause:

   - • For some time after the explosion Jack couldn't hear, and neither could he see.
   - • The council never wanted the new supermarket to be built, nor did local residents.

   Negative adverbials So.. .that = Inversion (1) =

   TOWN EVACUATED AS
   FOREST FIRES APPROACH
   The people of Sawston were evacuated
   yesterday as forest fires headed towards the
   town. Such the heat was of the oncoming
   inferno that trees more than 100 metres ahead
   began to smoulder. Only once in recent years,
   during 1994, a town of this size has had to be
   evacuated because of forest fires. A fleet of
   coaches and lorries arrived in the town in the
   early morning. Into these vehicles the sick and
   elderly climbed, before they headed off to
   safety across the river. Residents with cars
   were ordered to leave by mid morning.
   Later in the day, as the wind changed direction
   and it became clear that the fire would leave
   Sawston untouched, were heard complaints
   from some residents. "At no time the fires
   posed a real threat," said one local man. "I
   didn't want to leave my home, and nor most of
   my neighbours did." But Chief Fire Officer
   Jones replied, "Hadn't we taken this action,
   lives would have been put at risk. Only when
   the fires have moved well away from the town
   residents will be allowed to return to their
   homes."

   h a v e s a i d
   A You put single ('...') or double ("...") quotation marks at the beginning and end of a report
   of someone's exact spoken or written words. This is often referred to as direct speech:

   - • 'It's a pity you can't come this weekend.'
   - • "I'm really hungry. I fancy a cheese sandwich."

   B If there is a reporting clause (e.g. she said, exclaimed Tom) after the quotation, you put a
   comma before the second quotation mark:

   - • "I think we should go to India while we have the opportunity," argued Richard.

   If you are quoting a question or exclamation, you use a question mark or exclamation
   mark instead of a comma:

   - • "Can I make an appointment to see the doctor?" asked Bill.
   - • 'You must be mad!' yelled her brother.

   If the reporting clause comes within the quotation, you put a comma before the second
   quotation mark of the first part of the quotation, a comma at the end of the reporting clause,
   and start the second part of the quotation with a lower case (not a capital) letter:

   - • "It tastes horrible," said Susan, "but it's supposed to be very good for you."

   If the second part of the quotation is a new sentence you put a full stop at the end of the
   reporting clause, and start the second part of the quotation with a capital letter:

   - • "You should go home," Sandra advised. "You're looking really ill."

   If the reporting clause comes before the quotation, you put a comma at the end of the
   reporting clause, and a full stop (or question or exclamation mark) at the end of the
   quotation:

   - • John said, "Put them all on the top shelf."

   A colon is sometimes used at the end of the reporting clause instead of a comma:

   - • She stood up and shouted to the children: "It's time to go home!"

   C When you quote what a person thinks, you can either use the conventions described in A
   and B, or separate the quotation from the reporting clause with a comma (or colon) and
   leave out quotation marks:

   - • "Why did she look at me like that?" wondered Mary.
   - • Perhaps the door is open, thought Chris.
   - • Suddenly she thought: Could they be trying to trick me?

   the grammatical subject is the person
   or thing that performs the action
   given in the verb (e.g. Geoff wrote
   the book). Compare PASSIVE.
   adjective
   A word that describes a noun (e.g. an

   more or less of this quality (e.g. She's
   very happy), while ungradable
   adjectives can't (e.g. It's impossible.
   We can't say '...very impossible').
   Classifying adjectives say that
   something is of a particular type (e.g.
   atomic, initial). Emphasising
   adjectives stress how strongly we feel
   about something (e.g. utter
   nonsense).

   which we use to say how something
   is done (e.g. slowly, violently);

   politically) which we use to make
   clear from what point of view we are
   speaking; adverbs of indefinite
   frequency (e.g. always, never);
   degree adverbs (e.g. completely,
   quite) which give information about

   focus adverbs (e.g. just, even) which
   we use to focus on a particular word
   or phrase.
   adverbial clause

   cannot (e.g. If I see Tony at work
   (= subordinate clause), I'll invite him
   over this evening (= main clause)).
   Types of clause include: since-clause
   (e.g. I haven't seen him since we left
   265
   Glossary
   school); that-clause (e.g. She said that

   1 cook or are (normally) cooking.
   'Cook' implies that we start
   cooking at 6.00; 'are cooking'
   implies that we are cooking
   around this time.
   2 are phoning. More likely than
   'phone' as this seems to be a
   temporary situation.
   3 sees. More likely than 'is seeing'
   as 'most weekends' suggests a
   long-lasting situation.
   4 get up or are getting up. 'Get
   up' implies that 7.00 is the time
   at which we get up (e.g. that
   the alarm clock goes off); 'are
   getting up' implies that we are
   in the process of getting up
   around that time.
   5 go or am going. 'Go' implies a
   regular, possibly permanent,
   arrangement (perhaps I need to
   do this regular exercise to
   prevent weight gain); 'am
   going' implies a more
   temporary arrangement

   The past simple could be used
   instead of the present continuous
   in 2, 3 and 5 with a similar
   meaning.
   In 1, the past simple implies that I
   was already in the bath when the
   fire alarm went off; the past
   continuous implies that I was in
   the process of getting in -1 wasn't
   in yet.
   In 4, the past simple suggests two
   actions that followed each other -
   his mother looked away and then
   Steve slipped away; the past
   continuous implies that she was

   and during this time Steve slipped

   BARRISTER: Could you begin by
   telling the court what happened
   on the evening of the 26th July.
   SANDRA: Yes, I was walking
   home from work when I saw
   someone who I thought was my
   friend, Jo. I went up to her and
   touched her on the arm. But
   when the woman turned round
   it wasn't Jo at all. I just said,
   "I'm sorry, I mistook you for a
   friend."
   BARRISTER: And could you
   describe the woman in detail.
   SANDRA: Well, to be honest, her
   face shocked me. She reminded
   me of a witch from.a children's
   story - a long nose and staring
   eyes. When I tried to walk past,
   she stood in my way. I couldn't
   avoid her. She grabbed my arm
   and prevented me from
   escaping. I struggled, but she
   pulled me into a car parked
   nearby. She forced me to give
   her my purse and she wanted
   me to give her my ring, too. But
   I wasn't going to let her take
   that. So I hit her with my bag
   and leapt out of the car. Then I
   just ran (an adverb, e.g.
   away, could be used, but is not
   necessary here). At first I could
   hear her following (an object,
   e.g. me, could be used, but is
   not necessary here), but then
   she disappeared. After that I ran
   into the town centre and
   reported the attack to the
   police. They took a statement,
   and then they drove me home
   and warned me to lock my
   doors and windows. Later that
   night they phoned (an object,
   e.g. me, could be used, but is
   not necessary here) to say that
   they had arrested the woman.

   very old building which was

   The people of Sawston were
   evacuated yesterday as forest fires
   headed towards the town. Such
   was the heat of the oncoming
   inferno that trees more than 100
   metres ahead began to smoulder.
   Only once in recent years, during
   1994, has a town of this size had
   to be evacuated because of forest
   fires. A fleet of coaches and lorries
   arrived in the town in the early
   morning. Into these vehicles
   climbed the sick and elderly
   (inversion is more likely in this
   written context), before they
   headed off to safety across the
   river. Residents with cars were
   ordered to leave by mid morning.
   Later in the day, as the wind
   changed direction and it became
   clear that the fire would leave
   Sawston untouched, complaints
   were heard from some residents.
   "At no time did the fires pose a
   real threat," said one local man.
   "I didn't want to leave my home,
   and nor did most of mv
   neighbours." But Chief Fire
   Officer Jones replied, "Had we
   not taken this action, lives would
   have been put at risk. Only when
   the fires have moved well away
   from the town will residents be
   allowed to return to their
   homes."

   1 School classrooms have
   changed very little over the last
   century. The walls may be a
   little more colourful and the
   chairs may be more
   comfortable, but a (or the)
   school-child of 100 years ago
   would have no difficulty in
   recognising today's classroom.
   There are still rows of desks,
   perhaps a blackboard, and
   shelves of books. However,
   these days there is something
   found in classrooms that would
   bewilder them - the computer.
   And it is this that is completely
   changing the way we learn at
   school, at college and in the
   home.
   2 When a crime is first
   discovered, the police often
   don't know who has done it or
   why. Usually, though, the
   person who has committed the
   crime will have left some
   evidence of their identity at the
   scene such as a footprint,
   blood, or fibres from clothing.
   This evidence often forms the
   basis of any case against a
   suspect who the police may
   take to court.
   3 A space satellite does not need
   to be streamlined in order to fly
   since there is no air in space to
   slow it down. However, it does
   need a source of energy to
   power its electronic circuitry,
   so a (or the) satellite has large
   solar panels that convert
   sunlight into electricity. In
   addition, it is necessary for a
   (or the) satellite to stay in
   exactly the right position so
   that its antennae face the (zero
   article is also possible) radio
   stations on the ground. For this
   reason it is equipped with gas
   thrusters which can move the
   satellite into the correct orbit,
   high above the Earth.
