# /. Info: An Introduction
*************************

The GNU Project distributes most of its manuals in the “Info format”,
which you read using an “Info reader”.  You are probably using an Info
reader to read this now.

   There are two primary Info readers: ‘info’, a stand-alone program
designed just to read Info files (*note What is Info?: (info-stnd)Top.),
and the ‘info’ package in GNU Emacs, a general-purpose editor.  At
present, only the Emacs reader supports using a mouse.

   If you are new to the Info reader and want to learn how to use it,
type the command ‘h’ now.  It brings you to a programmed instruction
sequence.

   To read about advanced Info commands, type ‘n’ twice.  This brings
you to ‘Advanced Info Commands’, skipping over the “Getting Started”
chapter.

   If you are using Emacs, type ‘?’ to see a summary of all available
commands.  In the stand-alone Info reader, type ‘H’ instead.

documentation system.

# /. 1.1 Starting Info on a Small Screen
=======================================

Since your terminal has a relatively small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.

   If the entire text you are looking at fits on the screen, the text
‘All’ will be displayed near the bottom of the screen, on the mode line
(usually, the line in inverse video).  If you see the text ‘Top’
instead, it means that there is more text below that does not fit.  To
move forward through the text and see another screenful, press <SPC>,
the Space bar.  To move back up, press the key labeled ‘Backspace’ or
‘DEL’ (on some keyboards, this key might be labeled ‘Delete’).  In a
graphical Emacs, you can also use ‘S-<SPC>’ (press and hold the <Shift>
key and then press <SPC>) to move backwards, but this does not work in
the stand-alone Info reader (nor in Emacs, if you are using it in a
text-mode terminal).

   Here are 40 lines of junk, so you can try <SPC> and <DEL> and see
what they do.  At the end are instructions of what you should do next.

   If you have managed to get here, go back to the beginning with <DEL>
(or <BACKSPACE>), and come back here again, then you understand about
the ‘Space’ and ‘Backspace’ keys.  So now type an ‘n’—just one
character; don’t type the quotes and don’t type the Return key
afterward—to get to the normal start of the course.

# /. 1.2 How to use Info
=======================

You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.

   There are two ways to use Info: from within Emacs or as a stand-alone
reader that you can invoke from a shell using the command ‘info’.

   Right now you are looking at one “Node” of Information.  A node
contains text describing a specific topic at a specific level of detail.
This node’s topic is “how to use Info”.  The mode line says that this is
node ‘Help’ in the file ‘info’.

   The top line of a node is its “header”.  This node’s header (look at
it now) says that the ‘Next’ node after this one is the node called
‘Help-P’.  An advanced Info command lets you go to any node whose name
you know.  In the stand-alone Info reader program, the header line shows
the names of this node and the Info file as well.  In Emacs, the header
line is displayed with a special typeface, and remains at the top of the
window all the time even if you scroll through the node.

   Besides a ‘Next’, a node can have a ‘Previous’ link, or an ‘Up’ link,
or both.  As you can see, this node has all of these links.

   Now it is time to move on to the ‘Next’ node, named ‘Help-P’.

>> Type ‘n’ to move there.  Type just one character;
   do not type the quotes and do not type a <RET> afterward.

‘>>’ in the margin means it is really time to try a command.

>> If you are in Emacs and have a mouse, and if you already practiced
   typing ‘n’ to get to the next node, click now with the left
   mouse button on the ‘Next’ link to do the same “the mouse way”.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-P,  Next: Help-^L,  Prev: Help,  Up: Getting Started

# /. 1.3 Returning to the Previous node
======================================

This node is called ‘Help-P’.  The ‘Previous’ node, as you see, is
‘Help’, which is the one you just came from using the ‘n’ command.
Another ‘n’ command now would take you to the next node, ‘Help-^L’.

>> But do not type ‘n’ yet.  First, try the ‘p’ command, or
   (in Emacs) click on the ‘Prev’ link.  That takes you to
   the ‘Previous’ node.  Then use ‘n’ to return here.

   If you read this in Emacs, you will see an ‘Info’ item in the menu
bar, close to its right edge.  Clicking the mouse on the ‘Info’ menu-bar
item opens a menu of commands which include ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ (and
also some others which you didn’t yet learn about).

   This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but _please don’t_
start skimming.  Things will get complicated soon enough!  Also, please
do not try a new command until you are told it is time to.  You could
make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.

>> Now do an ‘n’, or (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button on
   the ‘Next’ link, to get to the node ‘Help-^L’ and learn more.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-^L,  Next: Help-Inv,  Prev: Help-P,  Up: Getting Started

# /. 1.4 The Space, DEL, B and ^L commands
=========================================

This node’s mode line tells you that you are now at node ‘Help-^L’, and
the header line tells you that ‘p’ would get you back to ‘Help-P’.  The
node’s title is highlighted and may be underlined as well; it says what
the node is about.

   This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display screen.
You can tell that there is more that is not visible because you can see
the text ‘Top’ rather than ‘All’ near the bottom of the screen.

   The <SPC>, <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>)(1) and ‘b’ commands exist to allow
you to “move around” in a node that does not all fit on the screen at
once.  <SPC> moves forward, to show what was below the bottom of the
screen.  <DEL> or <BACKSPACE> moves backward, to show what was above the
top of the screen (there is not anything above the top until you have
typed some spaces).

>> Now try typing a <SPC> (afterward, type a <BACKSPACE> to
   return here).

   When you type the <SPC>, the two lines that were at the bottom of the
screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  <DEL> or <BACKSPACE>
takes the two lines from the top and moves them to the bottom,
_usually_, but if there are not a full screen’s worth of lines above
them they may not make it all the way to the bottom.

   If you are reading this in Emacs, note that the header line is always
visible, never scrolling off the display.  That way, you can always see
the ‘Next’, ‘Prev’, and ‘Up’ links, and you can conveniently go to one
of these links at any time by clicking the middle mouse button on the
link.

   <SPC> and <DEL> not only move forward and backward through the
current node.  They also move between nodes.  <SPC> at the end of a node
moves to the next node; <DEL> (or <BACKSPACE>) at the beginning of a
node moves to the previous node.  In effect, these commands scroll
through all the nodes in an Info file as a single logical sequence.  You
can read an entire manual top to bottom by just typing <SPC>, and move
backward through the entire manual from bottom to top by typing <DEL>
(or <BACKSPACE>).

   In this sequence, a node’s subnodes appear following their parent.
If a node has a menu, <SPC> takes you into the subnodes listed in the
menu, one by one.  Once you reach the end of a node, and have seen all
of its subnodes, <SPC> takes you to the next node or to the parent’s
next node.

   Many keyboards nowadays have two scroll keys labeled ‘PageUp’ and
‘PageDown’ (or maybe ‘prior’ and ‘next’).  If your keyboard has these
keys, you can use them to move forward and backward through the text of
one node, like <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>).  However, <PageUp> and
<PageDown> keys never scroll beyond the beginning or the end of the
current node.

   If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to display it
again by typing ‘C-l’ (‘Control-L’—that is, hold down <CTRL> and type
‘L’ or ‘l’).

>> Type ‘C-l’ now.

   To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
the <BACKSPACE> key (or <DEL>) many times.  You can also type ‘b’ just
once.  ‘b’ stands for “beginning.”

>> Try that now.  (We have put in enough verbiage to push this past
   the first screenful, but screens are so big nowadays that perhaps it
   isn’t enough.  You may need to shrink your Emacs or Info window.)
   Then come back, by typing <SPC> one or more times.

   You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you want
to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type ‘?’ (‘H’
in the stand-alone Info reader), which displays a brief list of
commands.  When you are finished looking at the list, make it go away by
typing <SPC> repeatedly.

>> Type ‘?’ (or ‘H’ in the stand-alone Info reader) now.
   Press <SPC> to see consecutive screenfuls of the list
   until finished.  Then type <SPC> several times.  If
   you are using Emacs, the help will then go away automatically.
   If you are using the stand-alone Info reader, type ‘x’ to
   return here.

   From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and will
be expected to know how to use <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> to move around in
them without being told.  Since not all terminals have the same size
screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.

>> Now type ‘n’, or click the middle mouse button on the ‘Next’ link,
   to visit the next node.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The key which we call “Backspace or DEL” in this manual is
labeled differently on different keyboards.  Look for a key which is a
little ways above the <ENTER> or <RET> key and which you normally use
outside Emacs to erase the character before the cursor, i.e., the
character you typed last.  It might be labeled ‘Backspace’ or ‘<-’ or
‘DEL’, or sometimes ‘Delete’.

# /. 1.5 Invisible text in Emacs Info
====================================

Before discussing menus, we need to make some remarks that are only
relevant to users reading Info using Emacs.  Users of the stand-alone
version can skip this node by typing ‘]’ now.

   In Emacs, certain text that appears in the stand-alone version is
normally hidden, technically because it has the ‘invisibility’ property.
Invisible text is really a part of the text.  It becomes visible (by
default) after killing and yanking, it appears in printed output, it
gets saved to file just like any other text, and so on.  Thus it is
useful to know it is there.

   You can make invisible text visible by using the command ‘M-x
visible-mode’.  Visible mode is a minor mode, so using the command a
second time will make the text invisible again.  Watch the effects of
the command on the “menu” below and the top line of this node.

   If you prefer to _always_ see the invisible text, you can set
‘Info-hide-note-references’ to ‘nil’.  Enabling Visible mode permanently
is not a real alternative, because Emacs Info also uses (although less
extensively) another text property that can change the text being
displayed, the ‘display’ property.  Only the invisibility property is
affected by Visible mode.  When, in this tutorial, we refer to the
‘Emacs’ behavior, we mean the _default_ Emacs behavior.

   Now type ‘]’, to learn about the ‘]’ and ‘[’ commands.

* Menu:

* ]:         Help-].               Node telling about ].
* stuff:     Help-].               Same node.
* Help-]::                         Yet again, same node.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-],  Up: Help-Inv

1.5.1 The ‘]’ and ‘[’ commands
------------------------------

If you type ‘n’ now, you get an error message saying that this node has
no next node.  Similarly, if you type ‘p’, the error message tells you
that there is no previous node.  (The exact message depends on the Info
reader you use.)  This is because ‘n’ and ‘p’ carry you to the next and
previous node _at the same level_.  The present node is contained in a
menu (see next) of the node you came from, and hence is considered to be
at a lower level.  It is the only node in the previous node’s menu (even
though it was listed three times).  Hence it has no next or previous
node that ‘n’ or ‘p’ could move to.

   If you systematically move through a manual by typing ‘n’, you run
the risk of skipping many nodes.  You do not run this risk if you
systematically use ‘<SPC>’, because, when you scroll to the bottom of a
node and type another ‘<SPC>’, then this carries you to the following
node in the manual _regardless of level_.  If you immediately want to go
to that node, without having to scroll to the bottom of the screen
first, you can type ‘]’.

   Similarly, ‘<BACKSPACE>’ carries you to the preceding node regardless
of level, after you scrolled to the beginning of the present node.  If
you want to go to the preceding node immediately, you can type ‘[’.

   For instance, typing this sequence will come back here in three
steps: ‘[ n [’.  To do the same backward, type ‘] p ]’.

   Now type ‘]’ to go to the next node and learn about menus.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-M,  Next: Help-Xref,  Prev: Help-Inv,  Up: Getting Started

# /. 1.6 Menus and the ‘m’ command
=================================

With only the ‘n’ (next), ‘p’ (previous), ‘<SPC>’, ‘<BACKSPACE>’, ‘]’
and ‘[’ commands for moving between nodes, nodes are restricted to a
linear sequence.  Menus allow a branching structure.  A menu is a list
of other nodes you can move to.  It is actually just part of the text of
the node formatted specially so that Info can interpret it.  The
beginning of a menu is always identified by a line which starts with
‘* Menu:’.  A node contains a menu if and only if it has a line in it
which starts that way.  The only menu you can use at any moment is the
one in the node you are in.  To use a menu in any other node, you must
move to that node first.

   After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a ‘*’
identifies one subtopic.  The line usually contains a brief name for the
subtopic (followed by a ‘:’, normally hidden in Emacs), the name of the
node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally hidden in Emacs),
and optionally some further description of the subtopic.  Lines in the
menu that do not start with a ‘*’ have no special meaning—they are only
for the human reader’s benefit and do not define additional subtopics.
Here is an example:

     * Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.

   The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is ‘Node about
FOO’.  The rest of the line is just for the reader’s Information.  [[
But this line is not a real menu item, simply because there is no line
above it which starts with ‘* Menu:’.  Also, in a real menu item, the
‘*’ would appear at the very start of the line.  This is why the
“normally hidden” text in Emacs, namely ‘: Node about FOO.’, is actually
visible in this example, even when Visible mode is off.]]

   When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first thing
in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts the node
name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there is both a
subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be meaningful
to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking.  The subtopic
name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to specify.  Often
the node name is convenient for the user to specify and so both it and
the subtopic name are the same.  There is an abbreviation for this:

     * Foo::   This tells about FOO.

This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both ‘Foo’.  (The ‘::’ is normally hidden in Emacs.)

>> Now use <SPC> to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a ‘b’ and some <SPC>s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   ‘m’ command is not available.

   If you keep typing <SPC> once the menu appears on the screen, it will
move to another node (the first one in the menu).  If that happens, type
<BACKSPACE> to come back.

   The command to go to one of the subnodes is ‘m’.  This is very
different from the commands you have used: it is a command that prompts
you for more input.

   The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when you
type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is ready for
another command.  The ‘m’ command is different: it needs to know the
“name of the subtopic”.  Once you have typed ‘m’, Info tries to read the
subtopic name.

   Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing many
dashes near the bottom of the screen.  (This is the stand-alone
equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.)  There is one more line beneath
that one, but usually it is blank.  (In Emacs, this is the echo area.)
When it is blank, Info is ready for a command, such as ‘n’ or ‘b’ or
<SPC> or ‘m’.  If that line contains text ending in a colon, it means
Info is reading more input for the last command.  You can’t type an Info
command then, because Info is trying to read input, not commands.  You
must either give the input and finish the command you started, or type
‘Control-g’ to cancel the command.  When you have done one of those
things, the input entry line becomes blank again.  Then you can type
Info commands again.

   The command to go to a subnode via a menu is ‘m’.  After you type the
‘m’, the line at the bottom of the screen says ‘Menu item: ’.  You must
then type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with a <RET>.

   You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus put the
shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not matter
whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the subtopic.
You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the item name,
except for one space where a space appears in the item in the menu.

   You can also use the “completion” feature to help enter the subtopic
name.  If you type the <TAB> key after entering part of a name, it will
fill in more of the name—as much as Info can deduce from the part you
have entered.

   If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then you do
not need to type the argument: you just type a <RET>, and it stands for
the subtopic of the line you are on.  You can also click the middle
mouse button directly on the subtopic line to go there.

   Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.  This menu gives you
three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:

* Menu:

* Foo:  Help-FOO.       A node you can visit for fun.
* Bar:  Help-FOO.       We have made two ways to get to the same place.
* Help-FOO::            And yet another!

   (Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)

>>  Now type just an ‘m’ and see what happens:

   Now you are “inside” an ‘m’ command.  Commands cannot be used now;
the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.

   You can change your mind about doing the ‘m’ by typing ‘Control-g’.

>> Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.

>> Then type another ‘m’.

>> Now type ‘BAR’, the item name.  Do not type <RET> yet.

   While you are typing the item name, you can use the <DEL> (or
<BACKSPACE>) key to cancel one character at a time if you make a
mistake.

>> Press <DEL> to cancel the ‘R’.  You could type another ‘R’
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since ‘BA’ is a valid
   abbreviation.

>> Now you are ready to go.  Type a <RET>.

   After visiting ‘Help-FOO’, you should return here.

   Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between them is to
type <TAB>.  Each time you type a <TAB>, you move to the next subtopic
line.  To move to a previous subtopic line in the stand-alone reader,
type ‘M-<TAB>’—that is, press and hold the <META> key and then press
<TAB>.  (On some keyboards, the <META> key might be labeled ‘Alt’.)  In
Emacs Info, type ‘S-<TAB>’ to move to a previous subtopic line (press
and hold the <Shift> key and then press <TAB>).

   Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press <RET> to go to that
subtopic’s node.

   If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of going
to a subtopic.  Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic line, somewhere
between the beginning ‘*’ and the colon ‘:’ which ends the subtopic’s
brief name.  You will see the subtopic’s name change its appearance
(usually, its background color will change), and the shape of the mouse
pointer will change if your platform supports that.  After a while, if
you leave the mouse on that spot, a small window will pop up, saying
“mouse-2: go to that node,” or the same message may appear at the bottom
of the screen.

   ‘mouse-2’ is the second button of your mouse counting from the
left—the middle button on a 3-button mouse.  (On a 2-button mouse, you
may have to press both buttons together to “press the middle button”.)
The message tells you pressing ‘mouse-2’ with the current position of
the mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will go to that subtopic.

   More generally, ‘mouse-2’ in an Info buffer finds the nearest link to
another node and goes there.  For example, near a cross reference it
acts like ‘f’, in a menu it acts like ‘m’, on the node’s header line it
acts like ‘n’, ‘p’, or ‘u’, etc.  At end of the node’s text ‘mouse-2’
moves to the next node, or up if there’s no next node.

>> Type ‘n’ to see more commands.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-FOO,  Up: Help-M

1.6.1 The ‘u’ command
---------------------

Congratulations!  This is the node ‘Help-FOO’.  It has an ‘Up’ pointer
‘Help-M’, the node you just came from via the ‘m’ command.  This is the
usual convention—the nodes you reach from a menu have ‘Up’ nodes that
lead back to the menu.  Menus move Down in the tree, and ‘Up’ moves Up.
‘Previous’, on the other hand, is usually used to “stay on the same
level but go backwards”.

   You can go back to the node ‘Help-M’ by typing the command ‘u’ for
“Up”.  This puts you at the menu subtopic line pointing to the subnode
that the ‘u’ command brought you from.  (Some Info readers may put you
at the _front_ of the node instead—to get back to where you were
reading, you have to type some <SPC>s.)

   Another way to go Up is to click ‘mouse-2’ on the ‘Up’ pointer shown
in the header line (provided that you have a mouse).

>> Now type ‘u’ to move back up to ‘Help-M’.

In Info documentation, you will see many “cross references”.  Cross
references look like this: *Note Cross: Help-Cross.  That text is a
real, live cross reference, whose name is ‘Cross’ and which points to
the node named ‘Help-Cross’.  (The node name is hidden in Emacs.  Do
‘M-x visible-mode’ to show or hide it.)

   You can follow a cross reference by moving the cursor to it and press
<RET>, just as in a menu.  In Emacs, you can also click ‘mouse-1’ on a
cross reference to follow it; you can see that the cross reference is
mouse-sensitive by moving the mouse pointer to the reference and
watching how the underlying text and the mouse pointer change in
response.

   Another way to follow a cross reference is to type ‘f’ and then
specify the name of the cross reference (in this case, ‘Cross’) as an
argument.  For this command, it does not matter where the cursor was.
If the cursor is on or near a cross reference, ‘f’ suggests that
reference name in parentheses as the default; typing <RET> will follow
that reference.  However, if you type a different reference name, ‘f’
will follow the other reference which has that name.

>> Type ‘f’, followed by ‘Cross’, and then <RET>.

   As you enter the reference name, you can use the <DEL> (or
<BACKSPACE>) key to edit your input.  If you change your mind about
following any reference, you can use ‘Control-g’ to cancel the command.
Completion is available in the ‘f’ command; you can complete among all
the cross reference names in the current node by typing a <TAB>.

   To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you
can type ‘?’ after an ‘f’.  The ‘f’ continues to await a cross reference
name even after displaying the list, so if you don’t actually want to
follow a reference, you should type a ‘Control-g’ to cancel the ‘f’.

>> Type ‘f?’ to get a list of the cross references in this node.  Then
   type a ‘Control-g’ and see how the ‘f’ gives up.

   The <TAB>, ‘M-<TAB>’ and ‘S-<TAB>’ keys, which move between menu
items in a menu, also move between cross references outside of menus.

   Sometimes a cross reference (or a node) can lead to another file (in
other words another “manual”), or, on occasion, even a file on a remote
machine (although Info files distributed with Emacs or the stand-alone
Info avoid using remote links).  Such a cross reference looks like this:
*Note Overview of Texinfo: (texinfo)Top.  (After following this link,
type ‘l’ to get back to this node.)  Here the name ‘texinfo’ between
parentheses refers to the file name.  This file name appears in cross
references and node names if it differs from the current file, so you
can always know that you are going to be switching to another manual and
which one.

   Emacs normally hides some text in cross references.  If you put your
mouse over the cross reference, then the information appearing in a
separate box (tool tip) or in the echo area will show the full cross
reference, including the file name and the node name of the cross
reference if it leads to another file.  If you have a mouse, just leave
it over the next cross reference: *Note Overview of Texinfo:
(texinfo)Top, and watch what happens.  If you always like to have that
information visible without having to move your mouse over the cross
reference, use ‘M-x visible-mode’, or set ‘Info-hide-note-references’ to
a value other than ‘t’ (*note Emacs Info Variables::).

>> Now type ‘n’ to learn more commands.

1.7.1 The node reached by the cross reference in Info
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the node reached by the cross reference named ‘Cross’.

   While this node is specifically intended to be reached by a cross
reference, most cross references lead to nodes that “belong” someplace
else far away in the structure of an Info document.  So you cannot
expect this node to have a ‘Next’, ‘Previous’ or ‘Up’ links pointing
back to where you came from.  In general, the ‘l’ (el) command is the
only way to get back there.

>> Type ‘l’ to return to the node where the cross reference was.

# /. 1.8 Some intermediate Info commands
=======================================

The introductory course is almost over; please continue a little longer
to learn some intermediate-level commands.

   Most Info files have an index, which is actually a large node
containing little but a menu.  The menu has one menu item for each topic
listed in the index.  (As a special feature, menus for indices may also
include the line number within the node of the index entry.  This allows
Info readers to go to the exact line of an entry, not just the start of
the containing node.)

   You can get to the index from the main menu of the file with the ‘m’
command and the name of the index node; then you can use the ‘m’ command
again in the index node to go to the node that describes the topic you
want.

   There is also a short-cut Info command, ‘i’, which does all of that
for you.  It searches the index for a given topic (a string) and goes to
the node which is listed in the index for that topic.  *Note Search
Index::, for a full explanation.

   If you have been moving around to different nodes and wish to retrace
your steps, the ‘l’ command (‘l’ for “last”) will do that, one node-step
at a time.  As you move from node to node, Info records the nodes where
you have been in a special history list.  The ‘l’ command revisits nodes
in the history list; each successive ‘l’ command moves one step back
through the history.

>> Try typing ‘p p n’ and then three ‘l’’s, pausing in between
to see what each ‘l’ does.  You should wind up right back here.

   Note the difference between ‘l’ and ‘p’: ‘l’ moves to where _you_
last were, whereas ‘p’ always moves to the node which the header says is
the ‘Previous’ node (from this node, the ‘Prev’ link leads to
‘Help-Xref’).

   You can use the ‘r’ command (‘Info-history-forward’ in Emacs) to
revisit nodes in the history list in the forward direction, so that ‘r’
will return you to the node you came from by typing ‘l’.

   Clicking the mouse on the left arrow icon in the tool-bar while
holding down the <CTRL> key in Emacs opens a menu of previously visited
nodes: the same nodes that you can revisit by ‘Info-history-back’.
Selecting a node after clicking on the right arrow icon revisits the
same nodes as available by ‘Info-history-forward’.

   The ‘L’ command (‘Info-history’ in Emacs) creates a virtual node that
contains a list of all nodes you visited.  You can select a previously
visited node from this menu to revisit it.

   The ‘d’ command (‘Info-directory’ in Emacs) gets you instantly to the
Directory node.  This node, which is the first one you saw when you
entered Info, has a menu which leads (directly or indirectly, through
other menus), to all the nodes that exist.  The Directory node lists all
the manuals and other Info documents that are, or could be, installed on
your system.

>> Try doing a ‘d’, then do an ‘l’ to return here (yes,
   _do_ return).

   The ‘t’ command moves to the ‘Top’ node of the manual.  This is
useful if you want to browse the manual’s main menu, or select some
specific top-level menu item.  The Emacs command run by ‘t’ is
‘Info-top-node’.

>> Now type ‘n’ to see the last node of the course.

   *Note Advanced::, for more advanced Info features.

# /. 1.9 Quitting Info
=====================

To get out of Info, back to what you were doing before, type ‘q’ for
“Quit”.  This runs ‘quit-window’ in Emacs.

   This is the end of the basic course on using Info.  You have learned
how to move in an Info document, and how to follow menus and cross
references.  This makes you ready for reading manuals top to bottom, as
new users should do when they learn a new package.

   Another set of Info commands is useful when you need to find
something quickly in a manual—that is, when you need to use a manual as
a reference rather than as a tutorial.  We urge you to learn these
search commands as well.  If you want to do that now, follow this cross
reference to *note Advanced::.

   Yet another set of commands are meant for experienced users; you can
find them by looking in the Directory node for documentation on Info.
Finding them will be a good exercise in using Info in the usual manner.

>> Type ‘d’ to go to the Info directory node; then type
   ‘mInfo’ and Return, to get to the node about Info and
   see what other help is available.

# /. 2 Advanced Info Commands
****************************

This chapter describes various advanced Info commands.  (If you are
using a stand-alone Info reader, there are additional commands specific
to it, which are documented in several chapters of *note GNU Info:
(info-stnd)Top.)

   One advanced command useful with most of the others described here is
‘C-q’, which “quotes” the next character so that it is entered literally
(*note (emacs)Inserting Text::).  For example, pressing ‘?’ ordinarily
brings up a list of completion possibilities.  If you want to (for
example) search for an actual ‘?’ character, the simplest way is to
insert it using ‘C-q ?’.  This works the same in Emacs and stand-alone
Info.

File: info.info,  Node: Search Text,  Next: Search Index,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.1 ‘s’ searches Info documents
===================================

The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read the
entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find some
information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don’t know or
don’t remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when you
use a manual as a “reference”, or when it is impractical to read the
entire manual before you start using the programs it describes.

   Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual text or its indices.

   The ‘s’ command allows you to search a whole Info file for a string.
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You type
‘s’ followed by the string to search for, terminated by <RET>.  To
search for the same string again, just ‘s’ followed by <RET> will do.
The file’s nodes are scanned in the order they are in the file, which
has no necessary relationship to the order that they may be in the tree
structure of menus and ‘next’ pointers.  But normally the two orders are
not very different.  In any case, you can always look at the mode line
to find out what node you have reached, if the header is not visible
(this can happen, because ‘s’ puts your cursor at the occurrence of the
string, not at the beginning of the node).

   Instead of using ‘s’ in Emacs Info and in the stand-alone Info, you
can use an incremental search started with ‘C-s’ or ‘C-r’.  It can
search through multiple Info nodes.  *Note (emacs)Incremental Search::.
In Emacs, you can disable this behavior by setting the variable
‘Info-isearch-search’ to ‘nil’ (*note Emacs Info Variables::).


File: info.info,  Node: Search Index,  Next: Go to node,  Prev: Search Text,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.2 ‘i’ searches the indices for specific subjects
======================================================

Since most topics in the manual should be indexed, you should try the
index search first before the text search.  The ‘i’ command prompts you
for a subject and then looks up that subject in the indices.  If it
finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it goes to the node to
which that index entry points.  You should browse through that node to
see whether the issue you are looking for is described there.  If it
isn’t, type ‘,’ one or more times to go through additional index entries
which match your subject.

   The ‘i’ command and subsequent ‘,’ commands find all index entries
which include the string you typed _as a substring_.  For each match,
Info shows in the echo area the full index entry it found.  Often, the
text of the full index entry already gives you enough information to
decide whether it is relevant to what you are looking for, so we
recommend that you read what Info shows in the echo area before looking
at the node it displays.

   Since ‘i’ looks for a substring, you can search for subjects even if
you are not sure how they are spelled in the index.  For example,
suppose you want to find something that is pertinent to commands which
complete partial input (e.g., when you type <TAB>).  If you want to
catch index entries that refer to “complete,” “completion,” and
“completing,” you could type ‘icomplet<RET>’.

   Info documents which describe programs should index the commands,
options, and key sequences that the program provides.  If you are
looking for a description of a command, an option, or a key, just type
their names when ‘i’ prompts you for a topic.  For example, if you want
to read the description of what the ‘C-l’ key does, type ‘iC-l<RET>’
literally.

   Emacs provides the command ‘Info-virtual-index’, bound to the ‘I’
key.  This behaves like ‘i’, but constructs a virtual info node
displaying the results of an index search, making it easier to select
the one you want.

   If you aren’t sure which manual documents the topic you are looking
for, try the ‘M-x info-apropos’ command in Emacs, or the ‘M-x
index-apropos’ command in the stand-alone reader.  It prompts for a
string and then looks up that string in all the indices of all the Info
documents installed on your system.  In Emacs, giving a prefix argument
to the command will try to search for a regular expression instead of a
string.


File: info.info,  Node: Go to node,  Next: Choose menu subtopic,  Prev: Search Index,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.3 ‘g’ goes to a node by name
==================================

If you know a node’s name, you can go there by typing ‘g’, the name, and
<RET>.  Thus, ‘gTop<RET>’ would go to the node called ‘Top’ in this
file.  (This is equivalent to ‘t’, see *note Help-Int::.)  ‘gGo to
node<RET>’ would come back here.

   Like ‘m’, ‘g’ allows the use of abbreviations.  It also allows
completion, so you can type <TAB> to complete a partial node name.

   To go to a node in another file, you can include the file name in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
‘g(dir)Top<RET>’ would go to the Info Directory node, which is the node
‘Top’ in the Info file ‘dir’.  Likewise, ‘g(emacs)Top<RET>’ (or just
‘g(emacs)<RET>’) goes to the top node of the Emacs manual.

   The node name ‘*’ specifies the whole file.  So you can look at all
of the current file by typing ‘g*<RET>’ or all of any other file with
‘g(FILENAME)*<RET>’.


File: info.info,  Node: Choose menu subtopic,  Next: Create Info buffer,  Prev: Go to node,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.4 ‘1’–‘9’ choose a menu subtopic by its number
====================================================

If you begrudge each character of type-in which your system requires,
you might like to use the commands ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ..., ‘9’.  They
are short for the ‘m’ command together with a name of a menu subtopic.
‘1’ goes through the first item in the current node’s menu; ‘2’ goes
through the second item, etc.  In the stand-alone reader, ‘0’ goes
through the last menu item; this is so you need not count how many
entries are there.

   If your display supports multiple fonts, colors or underlining, and
you are using Emacs’s Info mode to read Info files, the third, sixth and
ninth menu items have a ‘*’ that stands out, either in color or in some
other attribute, such as underline; this makes it easy to see at a
glance which number to use for an item.

   Some terminals don’t support either multiple fonts, colors or
underlining.  If you need to actually count items, it is better to use
‘m’ instead, and specify the name, or use <TAB> to quickly move between
menu items.


File: info.info,  Node: Create Info buffer,  Next: Emacs Info Variables,  Prev: Choose menu subtopic,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.5 ‘M-n’ creates a new independent Info buffer in Emacs
============================================================

If you are reading Info in Emacs, you can select a new independent Info
buffer in a new Emacs window by typing ‘M-n’.  The new buffer starts out
as an exact copy of the old one, but you will be able to move
independently between nodes in the two buffers.  (In Info mode, ‘M-n’
runs the Emacs command ‘clone-buffer’.)

   In Emacs Info, you can also produce new Info buffers by giving a
numeric prefix argument to the ‘m’ and ‘g’ commands.  ‘C-u m’ and ‘C-u
g’ go to a new node in exactly the same way that ‘m’ and ‘g’ do, but
they do so in a new Info buffer which they select in another window.

   Another way to produce new Info buffers in Emacs is to use a numeric
prefix argument for the ‘C-h i’ command (‘info’) which switches to the
Info buffer with that number.  Thus, ‘C-u 2 C-h i’ switches to the
buffer ‘*info*<2>’, creating it if necessary.

   If you have created many Info buffers in Emacs, you might find it
difficult to remember which buffer is showing which manual.  You can use
the command ‘M-x info-display-manual’ to show an Info manual by name,
reusing an existing buffer if there is one.  When given a prefix
argument, this command limits the completion alternatives to currently
visited info files, thus giving a convenient way to switch between
several manuals.


File: info.info,  Node: Emacs Info Variables,  Prev: Create Info buffer,  Up: Advanced

# /. 2.6 Emacs Info-mode Variables
=================================

The following variables may modify the behavior of Info-mode in Emacs;
you may wish to set one or several of these variables interactively, or
in your init file.  *Note Examining and Setting Variables:
(emacs)Examining.  The stand-alone Info reader program has its own set
of variables, described in *note Manipulating Variables:
(info-stnd)Variables.

‘Info-directory-list’
     The list of directories to search for Info files.  Each element is
     a string (directory name) or ‘nil’ (try default directory).  If not
     initialized Info uses the environment variable ‘INFOPATH’ to
     initialize it, or ‘Info-default-directory-list’ in addition to the
     value returned by the ‘Info--default-directory-list’ function if
     there is no ‘INFOPATH’ variable in the environment.

     If you wish to customize the Info directory search list for both
     Emacs Info and stand-alone Info, it is best to set the ‘INFOPATH’
     environment variable, since that applies to both programs.

‘Info-additional-directory-list’
     A list of additional directories to search for Info documentation
     files.  These directories are not searched for merging the ‘dir’
     file.

‘Info-mode-hook’
     Hooks run when ‘Info-mode’ is called.  By default, it contains the
     hook ‘turn-on-font-lock’ which enables highlighting of Info files.
     You can change how the highlighting looks by customizing the faces
     ‘info-node’, ‘info-xref’, ‘info-xref-visited’, ‘info-header-xref’,
     ‘info-header-node’, ‘info-menu-header’, ‘info-menu-star’, and
     ‘info-title-N’ (where N is the level of the section, a number
     between 1 and 4).  To customize a face, type ‘M-x customize-face
     <RET> FACE <RET>’, where FACE is one of the face names listed here.

‘Info-fontify-maximum-menu-size’
     Maximum size of menu to fontify if ‘font-lock-mode’ is non-‘nil’.

‘Info-fontify-visited-nodes’
     If non-‘nil’, menu items and cross-references pointing to visited
     nodes are displayed in the ‘info-xref-visited’ face.

‘Info-use-header-line’
     If non-‘nil’, Emacs puts in the Info buffer a header line showing
     the ‘Next’, ‘Prev’, and ‘Up’ links.  A header line does not scroll
     with the rest of the buffer, making these links always visible.

‘Info-hide-note-references’
     As explained in earlier sections, the Emacs version of Info
     normally hides some text in menus and cross references.  It also
     replaces the ‘*note’ prefix of each cross reference with a more
     grammatically correct ‘see’.  This is the effect of the default
     value of this option, ‘t’.  Setting this option to ‘nil’ disables
     both hiding and replacing of the original cross reference text, and
     Emacs will then display them as they are in the Info file.  If you
     set it to the value ‘hide’, Emacs will do the same as with ‘t’, but
     will also remove ‘*note’ without replacing it with anything.
     Setting it to any other non-‘nil’ value produces an intermediate
     behavior, hiding a limited amount of text, but showing all text
     that could potentially be useful, including the name of the node
     that is the target of the cross reference and its file if it is
     different from the current file.

‘Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes’
     If set to a non-‘nil’ value, <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>, or
     ‘S-<SPC>’) keys in a menu visit subnodes of the current node before
     scrolling to its end or beginning, respectively.  For example, if
     the node’s menu appears on the screen, the next <SPC> moves to a
     subnode indicated by the following menu item.  Setting this option
     to ‘nil’ results in behavior similar to the stand-alone Info reader
     program, which visits the first subnode from the menu only when you
     hit the end of the current node.  The default is ‘nil’.

‘Info-isearch-search’
     If non-‘nil’, isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.

‘Info-enable-active-nodes’
     When set to a non-‘nil’ value, allows Info to execute Lisp code
     associated with nodes.  The Lisp code is executed when the node is
     selected.  The Lisp code to be executed should follow the node
     delimiter (the ‘DEL’ character) and an ‘execute: ’ tag, like this:

          ^_execute: (message "This is an active node!")

     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

# /. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
