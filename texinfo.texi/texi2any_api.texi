All of this information, with the exception of command-line options
and search directories associated with command line options
(@pxref{Loading Init Files}), may become
obsolete in a future Texinfo release.  Right now, the ``API''

so we must keep open the possibility of incompatible, possibly major,
changes.  Of course we try to avoid incompatible changes, but it is
not a promise.

This manual describes how to customize the @command{texi2any} HTML output.
Although some of the features here can technically be used with other output
formats, it's not especially useful to do so, so we'll write the documentation
as if HTML were the target format.  Most of the customizations are only
available for HTML.

The conversion of Texinfo to HTML is done in two steps.  After reading
command-line options and init files, input Texinfo code is parsed
into a Texinfo Perl tree and information is gathered on the document
structure.  This first step can only be customized to a certain extent, by
using the command-line options and setting customization variables.  The
Texinfo Perl tree describes a Texinfo document in a structured way which makes
it easy to go through the tree and format @@-commands and other containers.

The second step is the @dfn{conversion} step done in a converter.  The HTML
converter takes a Texinfo Perl tree as input and transforms it to HTML@.  The
code that is used to go through the tree cannot be customized, but the
conversion of tree elements can be fully customized.

@c Do we want to describe the tree in the manual?  It is already described
@c in (texi2any_internals)Texinfo::Parser TEXINFO TREE
@c  The tree structure will be described in future versions of the
@c manual.


@node Loading Init Files
@chapter Loading Initialization Files and Search Paths

@cindex Loading init files
@cindex Initialization files, loading
@cindex Search paths, for initialization files

@c @pindex texi2any-config.pm @r{init files loaded}
@cindex @file{texi2any-config.pm} init files loaded

@quotation Warning
The @file{texi2any-config.pm} file related paths and even the use
of @file{texi2any-config.pm} files is not definitive.
@end quotation

You can write so-called @dfn{initialization files}, or @dfn{init
files} for short, to modify almost every aspect of output formatting.
The program loads init files named @file{texi2any-config.pm} each time it
is run.  Those files are looked for in the following directories:

@table @file
@item @var{datadir}/texi2any/
(where @var{datadir} is the system data directory specified at
compile-time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/share})

@item @var{sysconfdir}/texi2any/
(likewise specified at compile time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/etc})

@item ~/.texi2any/
(where @code{~} is the current user's home directory)

@item ./.texi2any/
(under the current directory)

@item ./
(the current directory)
@end table

All @file{texi2any-config.pm} files found are loaded, in the above order.
Thus, @file{./texi2any-config.pm} can override entries in, say,
@file{/usr/local/share/makeinfo/texi2any-config.pm}.

@c @opindex --init-file
@cindex @option{--init-file}
However, the most common way to load an initialization file is with
the @option{--init-file} option, explicitly specifying the file to be
loaded.  By default the following directories are searched, in the
following order.  Only the first file found is used:

@enumerate
@item The current directory @file{./};

@item @file{./.texi2any/} under the current directory;

@item @file{~/.texi2any/}
where @code{~} is the current user's home directory;

@item @file{@var{sysconfdir}/texi2any/}
where @var{sysconfdir} is the system configuration directory
specified at compile-time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/etc};

@item @file{@var{datadir}/texi2any/}
Where @var{datadir} is the system data directory likewise specified at
compile time, e.g., @file{/usr/local/share};

@item @file{./.texinfo/init/} under the current directory;

@item @file{~/.texinfo/init/} under the current home directory;

@item @file{@var{sysconfdir}/texinfo/init/} with @var{sysconfdir} as above;

@item @file{@var{datadir}/texinfo/init/} with @var{datadir} as above.

@item @file{@var{datadir}/texinfo/ext/} with @var{datadir} as above.
@end enumerate

The @file{@var{datadir}/texinfo/ext/} directory contains the
init files directly loaded from @command{texi2any} code.  When loaded from
@command{texi2any} code directly, init files are only searched for
in that directory, being considered as part of the program and not as user
customization.  Since the directory is also in the list of directories searched
for init files loaded by the @option{--init-file} option, those init
files can also be loaded as regular user specified init files.

Additional directories may be prepended to the list with the
@option{--conf-dir} option (@pxref{Invoking @command{texi2any},,, texinfo, Texinfo}).


@node Init File Basics
@chapter Init File Basics

@cindex Init file basics
@cindex Perl, language for init files

Init files are written in Perl, and by convention have extension
@file{.init} or @file{.pm}.  Several init files are included in the Texinfo
distribution, and can serve as a good model for writing your own.  Another
example is the @code{Texinfo::Convert::HTML} module which implements
almost all the Texinfo HTML function described in this manual for the conversion
to HTML@footnote{The @code{Texinfo::Convert::HTML} module also implements the
HTML converter which go through the tree and call user defined functions.}.
In @code{Texinfo::Convert::HTML} the API may not be followed strictly for
performance reasons, in that case there should always be a @samp{API info:}
comment which shows what the API conformant code should be.
The Licenses conditions of the diverse files used as example should be taken
into account when reusing code.

@node Init File Namespace
@section Init File Namespace

@cindex Init file namespace
@cindex Namespace, for init files
@cindex Perl namespaces, for init files

Initialization file are loaded from the main program in the
@code{Texinfo::Config} namespace.  This means that the namespace of the main
program and the namespace of initialization files are distinct, which minimizes
the chance of a name clash.

It is possible to start init files with:
@example
package Texinfo::Config;
@end example
It is not required, but it may help some debugging tools determine in which
namespace the code is run.

In the @code{Texinfo::Config} namespace, the functions names beginning with
@samp{texinfo_}, @samp{GNUT_} and @samp{_GNUT_} are reserved.  User defined
functions in init files should never begin with those prefixes.

The HTML converter is not available directly in the init files namespace,
instead it is passed to functions defined in init files that are registered as
functions to be called from the converter. @xref{User Defined Functions}.


@node Managing Customization Variables
@section Managing Customization Variables

@cindex Customization variables, setting and getting

The basic operations on customization variables are to set and
retrieve their values.  New variables can also be added.

The customization variables also valid in the main program out of the HTML
converter are handled differently if they are strings or
arrays.  Conversely, customization variables only relevant for the conversion
phase set in the main program are always set like string variables, in
particular by associating array or hash references to customization variables.

This section describes customization variables set in the main program.  These
variables are in general passed to converters.  It is also possible to set
customization variables in the converters only, not in the main program.
This is explained later on (@pxref{Conversion Customization Variables}).

@node Setting Main Program String Variables
@subsection Setting Main Program String Variables

To set the value of a string customization variable from an initialization file,
use @code{texinfo_set_from_init_file}:

@defun texinfo_set_from_init_file ($variable_name, $variable_value)
@var{$variable_name} is a string containing the name of the variable
you want to set, and @var{$variable_value} is the value to which you
want to set it.  @var{$variable_value} may be @samp{undef}.
@end defun

For example,

@example
texinfo_set_from_init_file('documentlanguage', 'fr');
@end example

@noindent overrides the @code{@@documentlanguage} from the
document.  It would be overridden by @option{--document-language} on
the command line.
Another example:

@example
texinfo_set_from_init_file('SPLIT', 'chapter');
@end example

@noindent overrides the default splitting of the document.  It would be
overridden by @option{--split} on the command line.

A final example:

@example
texinfo_set_from_init_file('NO_CSS', 1);
@end example

@noindent overrides the default value for @code{NO_CSS}.  It would be
overridden by @code{--set-init-variable NO_CSS=1} on the command line.

Setting the output format cannot be done by setting the customization variable
@code{TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT}.  This customization variable sets the output
format in the main program, but not from init files as additional
code needs to be run.  Instead, the @code{texinfo_set_format_from_init_file}
function should be used:

@defun texinfo_set_format_from_init_file ($output_format)
@var{$output_format} is the output format; sets the output format,
without overriding formats set from the command line.
@end defun

Any output format can be set, but since only HTML can be customized,
the main use of @code{texinfo_set_format_from_init_file} is to
set the format to @samp{html}, such that HTML is generated
instead of Info in the default case.

For the customization variables associated with @@-commands, see
@ref{Customization Variables for @@-Commands,,, texinfo, Texinfo}.  For the
customization variables associated with command line options, see
@ref{Customization Variables and Options,,, texinfo, Texinfo}.


@node Modifying Main Program Array Variables
@subsection Modifying Main Program Array Variables

@quotation Warning
The main program customization variables associated with arrays
are not documented.
@end quotation

Customization variables for the main program associated with an array of values
are handled differently. Two functions can be used in init files,
@code{texinfo_add_to_option_list} to add values to the array and
@code{texinfo_remove_from_option_list} to remove values from the array
associated with the customization variable:

@defun texinfo_add_to_option_list ($variable_name, $variable_values_array_reference)
@defunx texinfo_remove_from_option_list ($variable_name, $variable_values_array_reference)
@var{$variable_name} is the name of the variable; the values in the
array reference @var{$variable_values_array_reference} are added to the
list associated with the variable with @code{texinfo_add_to_option_list}, and removed with
@code{texinfo_remove_from_option_list}.
@end defun


@node Setting Converter Variables in Main Program
@subsection Setting Converter Variables in Main Program

Array and hash references customization variables values relevant in converters
only (not in main program, but in the HTML converter) can be set through the
main program in init files.  These variables cannot be set on the command-line.
They are documented in the customization documentation, not in the main Texinfo
manual.  Such arrays or hashes references can be passed through
@code{texinfo_set_from_init_file}.  For example:

@example
my @@SECTION_BUTTONS =
  (
   \&singular_banner,
   'Back', 'Forward',   'FastBack', 'FastForward',
   'Up', 'Top', 'Contents', 'Index', 'About'
  );

texinfo_set_from_init_file ('SECTION_BUTTONS', \@@SECTION_BUTTONS);
@end example

@node Getting Main Program Variables Values
@subsection Getting Main Program Variables Values

To get the value of a variable, the function is
@code{texinfo_get_conf}:

@defun texinfo_get_conf ($variable_name)
@var{$variable_name} is the name of the variable; its value (possibly
@code{undef}) is returned.
@end defun

For example:

@example
if (texinfo_get_conf('footnotestyle') eq 'separate') @{ ... @}
@end example


@node Adding Customization Variables
@subsection Adding Customization Variables

@cindex Customization variables, adding

Trying to set a customization variable that is not known as a valid
customization variable in @command{texi2any} is an error.  It is possible, however,
to add new customization variables from init files.  To add a customization
variable, the function is @code{texinfo_add_valid_customization_option}:

@defun texinfo_add_valid_customization_option ($variable_name)
@var{$variable_name} is added as a valid customization variable name.
@end defun

The variable value, if set, should also be available in the converters and therefore
in the init file functions registered and called from the converters.


@node Init File Loading Error Reporting
@section Init File Loading Error Reporting

@cindex Error reporting @subentry loading

If an error or a warning should be emitted when loading an init file, before
the conversion, use @code{texinfo_register_init_loading_error} for an error and
@code{texinfo_register_init_loading_warning} for a warning.

@defun texinfo_register_init_loading_error ($message)
@defunx texinfo_register_init_loading_warning ($message)
Cause an error message or a warning message based on @var{$message}
to be output, taking into account options related to error reporting
such as @option{--force} or @option{--no-warn}.
@end defun

Errors or warning emitted from user defined functions should use the
converter (@pxref{Error Reporting in User Defined Functions}).


@node Simple formatting customization
@chapter Simple formatting customization

Some change in output formatting can be specified with simple code,
not very different from simple textual configuration information.


@node Init File Expansion Contexts
@section Init File Expansion Contexts: Normal, Preformatted, Code, String, Math

@cindex Init file expansion contexts
@cindex Expansion contexts, for init files
@cindex Contexts for expansion in init files

There are five expansion contexts of interest:

@table @emph
@item normal context
@cindex Normal expansion context
Paragraphs, index entries, tables, @enddots{}

@item preformatted context
@cindex Preformatted expansion context
When spaces between words are kept.  For example, within the
@code{@@display} (@pxref{@code{@@display},,, texinfo, Texinfo}) and
@code{@@example} environments (@pxref{@code{@@example},,, texinfo, Texinfo}), and
in menu comments.  The preformatted regions
are usually rendered using @code{<pre>} elements in HTML.

@item code context
When quotes and minus are kept.  In particular @code{---}, @code{``}
and other similar constructs are not converted to dash and quote special
characters.  For example, in @code{@@code} or @code{@@option} commands
(@pxref{Useful Highlighting,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

@item math context
@cindex Math expansion context
Math (@pxref{math,, @code{@@math}, texinfo, Texinfo}).  Code or preformatted
specifications are often used for math too. In those cases, there
is no way to separately specify the formatting in math context.

@item string context
@cindex String expansion context
When rendering strings without formatting elements, for example in titles.  The
string context allows for limited formatting, typically without any element
when producing HTML or XML, so the value can be used in an attribute.  XML
entities can be used in strings.

@end table

It is worth mentioning that in some cases, in particular for file names,
plain text can also be used in conversion.  There is no associated
context in the converter, so the conversion to plain text is usually
performed by converting a Texinfo elements tree outside of the main
conversion flow.


@node Simple Customization for Commands Without Arguments
@section Simple Customization for Commands Without Arguments

@cindex HTML customization for commands without arguments
@cindex Commands without arguments, customizing HTML for
@cindex Insertion commands, customizing HTML for

These commands include those whose names are a single nonletter
character, such as @code{@@@@}, and those with a normal alphabetic
name but whose braces should be empty, such as @code{@@TeX@{@}} and
@code{@@AA@{@}}.

To change the formatting of a command, the functions is
@code{texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting}:

@defun texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting ($command_name, @
    $context, $text, $html_element, $translated_string_converted, @
    $translated_string_to_convert)
@var{$command_name} is the @@-command name, without the leading @@.
@var{$context} is @samp{normal}, @samp{preformatted} or @samp{string}.
There is no separate math context, @samp{preformatted} should be used
for math context. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.  If @var{$context}
is @code{undef}, the @samp{normal} context is assumed.

The remaining arguments determine the formatting.  If @var{$text} is set,
the corresponding text is output when the @@-command is formatted.  @var{$text}
can contain HTML elements if needed.  If @var{$html_element} is set, the text
is enclosed between the @var{$html_element} element opening and the element
closing.  If @var{$translated_string_converted} is set, the corresponding
text is translated when the document language changes and used as text.
@var{$translated_string_converted} should already be HTML.  If
@var{$translated_string_to_convert} is set, the corresponding
text is translated when the document language changes and converted from
Texinfo code to HTML.  Since the conversion is done in the appropriate
context, @var{$translated_string_to_convert} should only be set for the
@samp{normal} context. @xref{Texinfo::Translations
METHODS,,,texi2any_internals}.
@end defun

It is not required to set values for all the contexts.  If preformatted context
output is not set, normal context output is used.  If string context output is not set,
preformatted context output is used.

For example, if you want @code{&shy;} to be output
for @code{@@-} in normal, preformatted (and math) and string context, call

@example
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('-', undef, '&shy;');
@end example

If you want @code{<small>...</small>} to be output for @code{@@enddots}
in normal context and @code{...} to be output in other contexts, call
@example
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('enddots',
                                           'normal', '...', 'small');
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('enddots',
                                           'preformatted', '...');
@end example

If you want @code{error--&gt;} to be used for @code{@@error} in every context,
with a translation when the document language changes, call

@example
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('error', undef, undef, undef,
                                           'error--&gt;');
@end example

If you want @code{is the @strong{same} as} to be used for @code{@@equiv},
translated when the document language changes, and converted from Texinfo to
HTML in the context of the translation, call
@example
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('equiv', undef, undef, undef,
                                 undef, 'is the @@strong@{same@} as');

commands (e.g., @code{@@code}, @code{@@t}),
and other simple commands with
arguments (e.g., @code{@@asis}, @code{@@clicksequence},
@code{@@sup}, @code{@@verb}) can be changed with
@code{texinfo_register_style_command_formatting}:

@var{$context} is @samp{normal}, @samp{preformatted} or @samp{string}.
There is no separate math context, @samp{preformatted} should be used
for math context. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.  If @var{$context}
is @code{undef}, the @samp{normal} context is assumed.

If @var{$html_element} is set, the argument is enclosed between the
@var{$html_element} element opening and the element closing.
@var{$html_element} is always ignored in @samp{string} context.  If @var{$in_quotes}
is true, the result is enclosed in quotes
associated with customization variables @code{OPEN_QUOTE_SYMBOL} and
@code{CLOSE_QUOTE_SYMBOL}.

If @var{$html_element} is undefined and @var{$in_quotes} is not set, the formatted
argument is output as is.
@end defun

For example, to set @code{@@sansserif@{argument@}} to be formatted as
@code{<code>@var{argument}</code>} in normal and preformatted context,
and as a quoted string in string context, use:

@example
texinfo_register_style_command_formatting('sansserif', 'code', 0,
                                          'normal');

                                          'string');
@end example

To output the formatted argument of @code{@@t} as is:
@example
foreach my $context ('normal', 'example', string') @{
  texinfo_register_style_command_formatting ('t', undef,

@node Simple Customization of Accent Commands
@section Simple Customization of Accent Commands

@cindex HTML customization for accent commands
@cindex Accent commands, customizing HTML for
@cindex Accent command named entities

The formatting of accent commands (@code{@@'}, @code{@@ringaccent},
@code{@@dotless}) can be customized with @code{USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY}.
It is also possible to change how accented commands are converted
to named entities.  The accent named entities are obtained by combining
a letter to be accented, such as @samp{e} and a postfix based on the
accent command name, for example @samp{acute} for the acute accent
@code{@@'}.  For example, @samp{@@'e} is converted to the @samp{&eacute;}
named entity in the default case.

The association of accent @@-command and named entity postfix and
the list of letters that can be prepended can be changed with
@code{texinfo_register_accent_command_formatting}:

@defun texinfo_register_accent_command_formatting ($accent_command_name, $entity_postfix, $letters)
@var{$accent_command_name} is a Texinfo accent formatting @@-command name,
@var{$entity_postfix} is a string corresponding to the accent command that
is postpended to the letter accent argument.  @var{$letters} is a string
listing the letters that can be combined with the @var{$entity_postfix}.
If @var{$entity_postfix} or @var{$letters} is an empty string, numeric entities
are used instead of named entities.
@end defun

For example, with the following code, @code{@@dotless@{i@}} should be converted
to @code{&inodot;}, and @code{@@dotless@{j@}} to @code{&jnodot;}.  Other letters
than @samp{i} and @samp{j} in argument of @code{@@dotless} should not be combined
into a named entity with that example.
@example
texinfo_register_accent_command_formatting('dotless', 'nodot', 'ij');
@end example


@node Simple Customization of Containers
@section Simple Customization of Containers

Texinfo tree elements that are not text container nor directly associated with
an @@-command can have information set on their formatting.  The first piece of
information is whether their contents should be considered in code context (@pxref{Init
File Expansion Contexts}).  The other piece of information is the type of
preformatted environment they are, analogous with the @@-command names of
@code{@@example} or @code{@@display}@footnote{Note that setting the type of preformatted environment does not
make sure that there are preformatted containers used for the formatting of their
contents instead of paragraph containers, since this is determined in the very
first step of parsing the Texinfo code, which cannot be customized.}.

The function used is @code{texinfo_register_type_format_info}:

@defun texinfo_register_type_format_info ($type, $code_type, $pre_class_type)
@var{$type} is the type of the container.  If @var{$code_type} is set, the container
contents are assumed to be in code context. @xref{Init File Expansion
Contexts}. If @var{$pre_class_type} is set, the HTML @code{<pre>} elements
class attribute are based on @var{$pre_class_type}, if there are such HTML
elements output for preformatted content of @var{$type} containers.
@end defun

For example, to set content appearing in-between node links in @code{@@menu},
which is in the @code{menu_comment} container type
to be formatted in a code context, with preformatted type @samp{menu-between}, use:

@example
texinfo_register_type_format_info('menu_comment', 1, 'menu-between');

@node Simple Customization of CSS
@section Simple Customization of CSS Rules and Imports

@cindex Customizing CSS
@cindex CSS customization

CSS in HTML output can already be modified with command line options
(@pxref{HTML CSS,,, texinfo, Texinfo}) and customization options such as
@code{NO_CSS} and @code{INLINE_CSS_STYLE}.

Information on static CSS data used in conversion and some control over the CSS
output is possible.  The information is about CSS rules lines and CSS import
lines obtained from parsing @option{--css-include=@var{file}} files, as
described in @ref{HTML CSS,,, texinfo, Texinfo}, and CSS style rules associated with HTML
elements and class attributes used in the conversion to HTML.  The CSS style
rules selectors are, classically, @code{@var{element}.@var{class}} strings with
@var{element} an HTML element and @var{class} an attribute class associated to
that element.

The function used are @code{css_get_info} to get information and
@code{css_add_info} to modify:

@defun @var{$converter}->css_get_info ($specification, $css_info)
@defunx @var{$converter}->css_add_info ($specification, $css_info, $css_style)

Those functions can only be used on a converter @var{$converter}, from
functions registered and called with a converter.  @var{$specification} is
@code{'rules'} to get information on or set information for CSS rules lines and
@code{'imports'} to get information on or set information for CSS import lines.
Any other value for @var{$specification} corresponds to CSS style rules
associated with HTML elements and class attributes selectors.

With @code{css_get_info}, if @var{$specification} is set to @code{'rules'} or
@code{'imports'}, the corresponding arrays are returned.  Otherwise,
if @var{$css_info} is @code{undef}, a hash reference with all the CSS rules selector as keys
and the corresponding rules as values is returned.  If @var{$css_info} is defined,
it is considered to be a CSS rule selector and the corresponding CSS style is returned,
or @code{undef} if not found.

With @code{css_add_info}, @var{$css_info} is an additional entry added to
CSS rules lines if @var{$specification} is set to @code{'rules'} or an additional
entry added to CSS import lines if @var{$specification} is set to @code{'imports'}.
Otherwise, @var{$css_info} is a CSS rule selector and the associated
style rule is set to @var{$css_style}.
@end defun

Some examples of use:

@example
my @@all_included_rules = $converter->css_get_info('rules');
my $all_default_selector_styles = $converter->css_get_info('styles');
my $titlefont_header_style = $converter->css_get_info('styles',
                                                      'h1.titlefont');

$converter->css_add_info('styles', 'h1.titlefont', 'text-align:center');
$converter->css_add_info('imports', "\@@import \"special.css\";\n");
@end example

Note that the CSS selectors and associated style rules that can be accessed and
modified will not necessarily end up in the HTML output. They are output
only if the HTML element and class corresponding to a selector is seen in the
document. @xref{Customizing CSS}.

How to run code during the conversion process is described later
(@pxref{Init File Calling at Different Stages}). The simplest way to
use the @code{css_add_info} function would be to use a function
registered for the @samp{structure} stage:

@example
sub my_function_set_some_css @{
  my $converter = shift;

  $converter->css_add_info('styles', 'h1.titlefont',
                           'text-align:center');
  # ... more calls to  $converter->css_add_info();
@}

texinfo_register_handler('structure', \&my_function_set_some_css);
@end example

@node Simple headers customizations
@chapter Simple headers customizations

Some customization of navigation panels appearing in header and footers in
output can be specified with simple code.  To explain how navigation
panels are customized, we first describe how the document is organized
and which directions are available as the directions is the basis for
navigation panel customization.


@node Output Element Units
@section Output Element Units

@cindex Output elements
@cindex Elements, main unit of output documents
@cindex Document units
@cindex Texinfo tree element units

We will call the main unit of output documents a document @dfn{unit},
or a Texinfo tree element @dfn{unit}.  An
element unit's association with output files is determined by the split
options (@pxref{Splitting Output,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  This section describes
precisely how these output units work, with details for customization.

@cindex Output elements, defined

The output elements are:

@table @emph
@item Normal document units
@cindex Normal document units
These are normal sections and nodes.  Usually a node is associated
with a following sectioning command, while a sectioning command is
associated with a previous node; they both together make up the
element unit.  Either the node or the sectioning command is considered to
be the main element component, depending on the values of the
customization variables @code{USE_NODES}
(@pxref{HTML Customization Variables,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

For example, when generating Info, the nodes are the units; when
generating HTML, either case may happen (@pxref{Two Paths,,, texinfo,
Texinfo}).

@item Top element
@cindex Top element

The top element is the highest element unit in the document structure.  If the
document has an @code{@@top} section (@pxref{@code{@@top} Command,,, texinfo,
Texinfo}), it is the element associated with that section; otherwise, it is the
element associated with the document's @code{@@node Top} (@pxref{The Top
Node,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  If there is no @code{@@node Top}, the first
element in the document is the top element.  The Top element is also
a normal element.

@item Miscellaneous elements
@cindex Table of contents, output element unit
@cindex Short table of contents, output element unit
@cindex Overview, output element unit
@cindex Footnotes, output element unit
@cindex About page, output element unit
The remaining element units are associated with different files if the
document is split, and also if @code{MONOLITHIC} is not set.  There
are four such miscellaneous elements, also called special elements:
@enumerate
@item Table of contents
@item Short table of contents, also called Overview
@item Footnotes page
@item About page
@end enumerate

More details:

@itemize
@item The @emph{Table of contents} should only be formatted if
@code{@@contents} is present in the document.

@item Similarly the @emph{Short table of contents} should only appear if
@code{@@shortcontents} or @code{@@summarycontents} is present.

@item The customization variables @code{contents} and
@code{shortcontents} may be set to trigger the output of the
respective elements.

@vindex CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION@r{, Elements}
@item If @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} is set to @samp{separate_element}, the
@emph{Table of contents} and @emph{Short table of contents} elements are
separate (@pxref{Contents and Short Table of Contents Customization}).
Otherwise the @emph{Table of contents} and @emph{Short table of contents}
elements are directly included within the document, at locations depending on
the specific @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} value.

@item When generating HTML, the @emph{Footnotes page} should only
be present if the footnotes appear on a separate page (@pxref{Footnote
Styles,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  However, a footnote element is present if the document is
not split.

@item The @emph{About page} shouldn't be present for documents
consisting of only one sectioning element, or for monolithic documents
without navigation information, or if @code{DO_ABOUT} is not set.

@end itemize
@end table

It is common not to have anything but normal element units, especially in
case of monolithic output.

@vindex USE_NODES
The main component of elements is sections if @code{USE_NODES} is 0;
conversely, the main component is nodes if @code{USE_NODES} is set.

When sections are the main components of element units, ``isolated'' nodes
not directly associated with a sectioning command are associated with
the following sectioning command, while sectioning commands without
nodes constitute element units.  Conversely, when nodes are the main
components of elements, isolated sections not associated with nodes
are associated with the previous node, and isolated nodes are
element units.


@node Directions
@section Directions

@cindex Output element unit directions
@cindex Links information
@cindex Element directions
@cindex Directions

A variety of data items, called @dfn{element directions}, are associated
with element units.  They may be used in the formatting functions, and/or
associated with a button (@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}).

Each element direction has a name and a reference to the element unit they
point to, when such an element exists.  The element is either a
global element unit (for example, the Top element) or relative to the
current element unit (for example, the next element unit).  Such relative
elements are determined with respect to the document structure defined
by the section structuring commands (@code{@@chapter},
@code{@@unnumbered}@dots{}) or by the nodes if the node pointers are
specified on @code{@@node} lines or in menus (@pxref{Two Paths,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

Here is the list of global element units directions:

@table @emph
@item @samp{@ }
An empty button.

@item Top
Top element.

@item About
About (help) page.

@item Contents
Table of contents.

@item Overview
Overview: short table of contents.

@item Footnotes
Corresponds to the @code{Footnotes} element (@pxref{Output Element
Units}).

@item Index
The first element unit with @code{@@printindex}.

@end table

Here is the list of relative element units directions:

@table @emph
@item This
The current element unit.

@item Forward
Next element unit in reading order.

@item First
First element unit in reading order.

@item Last
Last element unit in reading order.

@item Back
Previous element unit in reading order.

@item FastForward
Next chapter element unit.

@item FastBack
Beginning of this chapter, or previous chapter if the element is a chapter.

@item Next
Next section element unit at the same level.

@item Prev
Previous section element unit at the same level.

@item Up
Up section.

@item SectionNext
Next element unit in section reading order.

@item SectionPrev
Previous element unit in section reading order.

@item SectionUp
Up in section reading order.

@item NodeNext
Next node element unit.

@item NodeForward
Next node element unit in node reading order.

@item NodeBack
Previous node element unit in node reading order.

@item NodePrev
Previous node element unit.

@item NodeUp
Up node element unit.

@end table

@cindex @code{FirstInFile} direction variant
@anchor{@code{FirstInFile} direction variant}
Relative direction elements are each associated to a variant, with
@samp{FirstInFile} prepended, which points to the direction relative
to the first element in file.  For example, @code{FirstInFileNodeNext}
is the next node element relative to the first element in file.  The
@samp{FirstInFile} directions are usually used in footers.


@node Element Direction Information Type
@subsection Element Direction Information Type

@cindex Direction information type
@cindex Type, of direction information
The element directions also have types of information associated,
which are in general set dynamically depending on the current element
unit, for instance on the element unit whose navigation panel is being
formatted:

@table @code
@item href
A string that can be used as an href attribute linking to the element unit
corresponding to the direction.

@item string
A string representing the direction that can be used in
context where only entities are available (attributes).
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item text
A string representing the direction to be used in contexts
with HTML elements (preformatted and normal contexts).
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item tree
A Texinfo tree element representing the direction.

@item target
A string representing the target of the direction, typically used as id
attribute in the element unit corresponding to the direction, and in href
attribute.

@item node
Same as @code{text}, but selecting the node associated with the element unit
direction in priority.

@item section
Same as @code{text}, but selecting the sectioning command
associated with the element unit direction in priority.

@end table

@code{text}, @code{tree} and @code{string} also have a variant with
@samp{_nonumber} prepended, such as @code{text_nonumber} without sectioning
command number in the representation.


@node Direction Strings
@subsection Direction Strings

Directions have strings associated, corresponding to their names, description
or specific HTML keywords:

@cindex Direction strings

@table @code
@item accesskey
Direction @code{accesskey} attribute used in navigation.

@item button
Direction short name typically used for buttons.

@item description
Description of the direction.

@item example
Section number corresponding to the example used in the About special
element text.

@item rel
Direction @code{rel} attribute used in navigation.

@item text
Direction text in a few words.
@end table

@cindex Translated direction strings
@samp{button}, @samp{description} and @samp{text} are translated based
on the document language.

The @code{FirstInFile} direction variants are associated with the same
strings as the direction they are prepended to (@pxref{@code{FirstInFile}
direction variant}).  For example @code{FirstInFileNodeNext} is associated
with the same strings as @code{NodeNext}.


@node Direction Strings Customization
@section Direction Strings Customization

The direction strings can be customized with
@code{texinfo_register_direction_string_info}:

@defun texinfo_register_direction_string_info ($direction, @
          $type, $converted_string, $string_to_convert, $context)
@var{$direction} is a direction (@pxref{Directions}), @var{$type}
is the type of string (@pxref{Direction Strings}).  The other
arguments are optional.  @var{$context} is @samp{normal} or @samp{string}.
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.  If
$context is @code{undef}, the @samp{normal} context is assumed.

@var{$converted_string} is the string, already converted to HTML
that is used for the specified context.  If the @samp{normal} context
@var{$converted_string} only is specified, the same string will be
used for the @samp{string} context.

Alternatively, @var{$string_to_convert} can be specified to set the
string to the corresponding Texinfo code after translation
and conversion to HTML.  In that case, the context is ignored, as
it will be set at the time of the conversion.

@var{$string_to_convert} is ignored for
special strings that do not need to be translated and cannot contain
Texinfo @@-commands (@samp{accesskey}, @samp{rel} and @samp{example}).
@var{$string_to_convert} is also ignored if @var{$converted_string} is set
for any context.
@end defun


@node Simple Navigation Panel Customization
@section Simple Navigation Panel Customization

@cindex Simple Customization, of navigation panel
@cindex Navigation panel, simple customization of

The @dfn{navigation panel} is the line of links (and labels) that
typically appears at the top of each node, so that users can easily
get to the next node, the table of contents, and so on.  It can be
customized extensively.

The customization variables
@code{VERTICAL_HEAD_NAVIGATION}, @code{ICONS}, @code{HEADERS},
@code{HEADER_IN_TABLE}, @code{USE_ACCESSKEY}, @code{USE_REL_REV} and
@code{WORDS_IN_PAGE}
may be used to change the navigation panel formatting.
@xref{HTML Customization Variables,,, texinfo, Texinfo}.

Setting @code{ICONS} is necessary but not sufficient to get icons for direction
buttons since no button image is specified in the default case.
The @code{ACTIVE_ICONS} and @code{PASSIVE_ICONS} customization
variables need to be set in addition:

@vtable @code
@item ACTIVE_ICONS
@itemx PASSIVE_ICONS
Hash references with element directions as key (@pxref{Directions}) and button
image icons as values.  @code{ACTIVE_ICONS} is used for directions actually
linking to an element, and @code{PASSIVE_ICONS} are used if there is no
element to link to.  The button images are interpreted as URLs.
@end vtable

@cindex Navigation panel button specification
@cindex Button specification, navigation panel

Several arrays and hashes enable even more precise control over the navigation
panel buttons and their display.  They can be set as customization variables
with @code{texinfo_set_from_init_file}. @xref{Setting Main Program String
Variables}.

The following customization variables arrays determine the
buttons present in the various navigation panels:

@vtable @code
@item SECTION_BUTTONS
Specifies the navigation panel buttons present at the beginning of sectioning
elements in the case of section navigation being enabled or if split at nodes.
Specifies the navigation panel buttons present at the page header if split at
section and there is no section navigation.

@item SECTION_FOOTER_BUTTONS
@itemx CHAPTER_FOOTER_BUTTONS
@itemx NODE_FOOTER_BUTTONS
These arrays specify the navigation panel buttons present in the page
footer when the output is split at sections, chapters or nodes, respectively.

@item CHAPTER_BUTTONS
Specifies the buttons appearing at the page header if split at chapters and
there is no section navigation.

@item MISC_BUTTONS
Specifies the buttons appearing at the beginning of special elements
and, if the output is split, at the end of such elements.

@item LINKS_BUTTONS
Used for @code{<link>} elements if they are output in the headers.

@item TOP_BUTTONS
Specifies the buttons used in the top element (@pxref{Output Element
Units}).
@end vtable

Each array specifies which buttons are included, and how they are
displayed.  Each array element is associated with a button of the
navigation panel from left to right.  The meaning of the array element
values is the following:

@anchor{Buttons Display}

@table @emph
@item string with an element unit direction
If icons are not used, the button is a link to the corresponding
element whose text is the @code{text} direction string
(@pxref{Direction Strings}), surrounded by @samp{[} and
@samp{]}. If the element direction is @samp{ }, the @samp{[} and @samp{]}
are omitted.

@vindex ACTIVE_ICONS
@vindex PASSIVE_ICONS
@cindex Icons, in navigation buttons
If icons are used, the button is an image whose file is determined by
the value associated with the element direction in the
@code{ACTIVE_ICONS} variable hash if the link leads to an element, or in the
@code{PASSIVE_ICONS} variable hash if there is no element to link to.  If
there is a link to the element, the icon links to that element.  The
button name and button description are given as HTML attributes to
have a textual description of the icon.  The corresponding strings
correspond to the @code{button} direction string for the button name
and the @code{description} for a more detailed description (@pxref{Direction
Strings}).

@item function reference
The function is called with one boolean argument, true if the
navigation panel should be vertical.  Should return the formatted
button text.

@item scalar reference
The scalar value is printed.

@item array reference of length 2
Here, the first array element should be a an element direction.
A link to the element unit associated with the element direction
is generated.  The text of the link depends on the second array element.

@table @emph
@item reference to a text string
In that case, the corresponding text is used.

@item reference to a function
The functions is called with two arguments, the converter object and the
element direction and should return two scalars, the link href and text and a boolean
set if a delimiter is needed after that button.

@item text string
The text string is interpreted as an element direction information type
and the corresponding text is used for the link.
@xref{Element Direction Information Type}.

For example, if the button array element is
@example
[ 'Next', 'node' ]
@end example

@noindent
Then the button will be a link to the next section with text
based on the name of the node associated with the next section element unit.

@end table

@end table

@anchor{Accesskey and @code{rel} Navigation}
@cindex @code{accesskey} navigation
If the customization variable @code{USE_ACCESSKEY} is set, the
@code{accesskey} attribute is used in navigation.  The @code{accesskey}
direction string is then used for the @code{accesskey} attributes
(@pxref{Direction Strings}).

@cindex @code{rel} navigation
Similarly, if the @code{USE_REL_REV} customization variable is set,
the @code{rel} attribute is used in navigation.  In that case the
@code{rel} direction string is used for the @code{rel}
attribute (@pxref{Direction Strings}).


@node User Defined Functions
@chapter User Defined Functions

Getting beyond the customization described previously requires
writing some functions and registering those functions such that they
are called for the conversion. This allows dynamic redefinition
of functions used to produce output.


@node User Defined Functions are Registered
@section User Defined Functions are Registered

@cindex User defined functions, registering

User defined functions are always passed as a code reference to a registering
function, together with a string describing what the function formats.
In the following made up example, @code{my_formatting_function} is
passed as a function reference @code{\&my_formatting_function} to the
registering function @code{texinfo_register_command_formatting}, with
the string specifying the formatting done by the function being
@samp{format_thing}:

@example
sub my_formatting_function @{
  my $arg1 = shift;
  my $arg2 = shift;
  # prepare $formatted_text
  ...
  return $formatted_text;
@}

texinfo_register_command_formatting ('format_thing', \&my_formatting_function);
@end example

As such functions are defined by a reference name associated with a string
we will always use the string in function prototypes.  For the function arguments
we will use @code{\@@array} to indicate a reference to an array
(a.k.a.@: list, in Perl terminology), @code{\%hash} for a reference
to a hash and @code{\&function} for a reference on a function.

To illustrate these conventions, here is the prototype for the
function associated with @samp{format_thing}:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_thing (@var{$arg1}, @var{\@@arg2})
A function reference associated with @samp{format_thing} has a first argument
@var{$arg1}, a second argument a reference to an array @var{\@@arg2}, and
returns the formatted text @var{$text}.
@end deftypefn


@node Converter Object and Conversion Functions
@section Converter Object and Conversion Functions

The first argument of most, if not all user defined function is a converter
object.  This object gives access to methods to get information on the
conversion context and to methods useful for the conversion, both as an HTML
converter and as a generic @code{Texinfo::Convert::Converter}
(@pxref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter Helper methods,,,texi2any_internals}).  The
converter can also be used for error reporting as it is also a
@code{Texinfo::Report} object (@pxref{Texinfo::Report,,,texi2any_internals}),
and for in-document strings translation as it is also a
@code{Texinfo::Translations} object (@pxref{Texinfo::Translations,,,
texi2any_internals}).  @xref{Error Reporting in User Defined Functions} on
error reporting.


@node Texinfo Tree Conversion Functions
@subsection Texinfo Tree Conversion Functions

One important converter method that can be used in user defined functions
is @code{convert_tree} that convert a Texinfo tree rooted at any element.
There is no reason to use that function often, as the converter
already goes through the tree calling reference functions to convert
the elements, but it can be interesting in some cases.

@deftypefun {@var{$converted_text} =} @var{$converter}->convert_tree (@var{\%element}, @var{$explanation})
@var{\%element} is a Texinfo tree element. @var{$explanation} is
optional, it is a string explaining why the function was called, to help
in case of debugging.  The function returns @var{\%element} converted.
@end deftypefun

@code{convert_tree} is suitable when the conversion is in the flow of the Texinfo
tree conversion.  Sometime, it is better to ignore the formatting context
of the main conversion, for example for the formatting of a caption, or the formatting
of footnotes texts.  Another special case is the case of tree elements being converted
more than once, even if in the flow of the Texinfo tree conversion, for example
if there are multiple @code{@@insertcopying} in a document.  A last special case arise,
with formatting done in advance or out of the main conversion.  This is the case, in practice, for
sectioning commands or node commands which may be formatted as directions in navigation
panels, menus or indices, may appear more than once in the document and be
converted more than once, if language changes, for example.

For such cases, the function is
@code{convert_tree_new_formatting_context} which sets the context appropriately.
@code{convert_tree_new_formatting_context} ultimately calls @code{convert_tree}.

@deftypefun {@var{$converted_text} =} @var{$converter}->convert_tree_new_formatting_context @
      (@var{\%element}, @var{$context}, @var{$multiple_pass}, @var{$global_context}, @
       @var{$block_command_name})
@var{\%element} is a Texinfo tree element.  @var{$context} is an optional
string describing the new context to be setup to format out of the main
conversion flow.  If not defined, the conversion is done in the main document
flow.  @var{$multiple_pass} is an optional string that marks that the
conversion is done more than once.  It should be unique and suitable for
inclusion in targets and identifiers.  @var{$global_context} is an optional
string that marks that the formatting may be done in advance, and can be
redone.  @var{$block_command_name} is an optional block command name that is
used to initialized the new context.  It can be useful, in particular, to propagate
the topmost block command in the new context.

The function returns @var{\%element} converted, setting the conversion context
according to the arguments.
@end deftypefun

@xref{Setting the Context for Conversion} on how to set a specific context for
a Texinfo tree conversion.


@node Error Reporting in User Defined Functions
@subsection Error Reporting in User Defined Functions

@cindex Error reporting @subentry conversion
@cindex @code{Texinfo::Report}

To report an error or a warning in a user defined function, use the methods
of @code{Texinfo::Report} through a converter object
(@pxref{Converter Object and Conversion Functions}).

To report a warning or an error not specific of an element conversion,
use @code{document_warn} or @code{document_error}:

@defun @var{$converter}->document_error ($text, $converter)
@defunx @var{$converter}->document_warn ($text, $converter)
Register a document-wide error or warning.  @var{$text} is the error
or warning message.  The @var{$converter} object should be given
as the second argument.
@end defun

To report a warning or an error in element conversion, use
@code{line_warn} or @code{line_error}
@defun @var{$converter}->line_error ($text, $converter, $location_info, $continuation, $silent)
@defunx @var{$converter}->line_warn ($text, $converter, $location_info, $continuation, $silent)
Register a warning or an error.  @var{$text} is the text of the
error or warning.  The @var{$converter} object should be given
as the second argument.  The optional
@var{$location_info} holds the information on the error or
warning location.  The @var{$location_info} reference on hash may be
obtained from Texinfo elements @code{source_info} keys.

The optional @var{$continuation} argument, if set, conveys that the message
is a continuation of the previous registered message.  The optional
@var{$silent} argument, if set, suppresses the immediate output of a message
if the @code{DEBUG} customization variable is set.
@end defun

In general, registering an error does not stop the processing, in
particular it does not stop the main conversion of the Texinfo tree.
Write initialization files as if the conversion always continued
after registering the error.

@xref{Texinfo::Report,,,texi2any_internals} for more on
@code{Texinfo::Report}.
@c @xref{Init File Calling at Different Stages} for information on how
@c to stop the processing from user defined functions called at different
@c stages.


@node Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions
@section Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions

Many user defined functions used for formatting have Texinfo tree elements
as arguments.  The user defined code should never modify the tree elements.
It is possible to reuse Texinfo tree elements information, but with
a copy.  For example, the following is ok:

@example
my @@contents = @@@{$element->@{'contents'@}@};
push @@contents, @{'text' => ' my added text'@};
my $result = $converter->convert_tree(@{'cmdname' => 'strong',
                                  'contents' => \@@contents @});
@end example

The following is not ok:

@example
push @@@{$element->@{'contents'@}@}, @{'text' => ' my added text'@};
@end example

In addition to the elements obtained after parsing a Texinfo
document, two elements are added,
@code{unit} type elements that correspond to the normal document units
(@pxref{Output Element Units}), and special elements with type
@code{special_element} that correspond to added special elements (@pxref{Output
Element Units}).  These added elements, as well as nodes and sectioning elements
hold information on the document structure in the @code{structure} element hash
(@pxref{Texinfo::Structuring METHODS,,,texi2any_internals}).

Normal tree unit elements have a @code{unit_command} key in the
@code{extra} hash that points to the associated @code{@@node} or
sectioning @@-command depending on which of nodes or sectioning commands
are the main components of elements. @xref{Output Element Units}.

The following keys of the @code{structure} hash can be interesting:

@cindex Document structure

@table @code
@item associated_unit
For sectioning and @code{@@node} @@-command elements.  The associated
tree unit element.

@item section_childs
For sectioning commands elements.  The children of the sectioning element
in the sectioning tree.

@item section_level
The level of the section, taking into account @code{@@raisesections} and
@code{@@lowersections}.  Level 0 corresponds to @code{@@top} or @code{@@part}
and level 1 to @code{@@chapter} level sectioning commands.
@xref{Raise/lower sections,,, texinfo, Texinfo}.

@item unit_filename
For tree unit elements. The associated file name.

@item unit_next
For tree unit elements. The next unit element in document order.

@item unit_prev
For tree unit elements. The previous unit element in document order.
@end table


Detailed information on the tree elements is available in the Texinfo Parser
documentation, in particular a list of types and of information in the elements
@code{extra} hash (@pxref{Texinfo::Parser TEXINFO TREE,,,texi2any_internals}).


@node Encoding and Decoding File Path Strings
@section Encoding and Decoding File Path Strings


@node Encoding File Path Strings
@subsection Encoding File Path Strings

In general, the strings in the customization functions are character strings.  For most purposes,
this is right, and the encoding in output files is taken care of by the converter.
Operations on directories and file names, however, such as the creation of a directory
or the opening of a file require binary strings.

To encode file names consistently with file name encoding used in the conversion to
HTML, there is a function @code{encoded_output_file_name}:

@deftypefun {(@var{$encoded_name}, @var{$encoding}) =} @var{$converter}->encoded_output_file_name (@var{$character_string_name})
Encode @var{$character_string_name} in the same way as other file name are
encoded in the converter, based on @code{DOC_ENCODING_FOR_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME},
and @code{LOCALE_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME_ENCODING} or on input file encoding
(@pxref{Other Customization Variables,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  Return the
encoded name and the encoding used to encode the name.
@end deftypefun

There is also a similar function for the input file names encoding,
@code{encoded_input_file_name}, which uses
@code{DOC_ENCODING_FOR_INPUT_FILE_NAME} and
@code{LOCALE_INPUT_FILE_NAME_ENCODING} and is less likely to be useful.

When calling external commands, the command line arguments should also
be encoded.  To do similarly with other codes, the customization variable
@code{MESSAGE_ENCODING} should be used.  Already encoded file
names may be used.  For example

@example
use Encode qw(encode);

....

my ($encoded_file_path, $encoding)
  = $converter->encoded_output_file_name($file_name);

my $fh = open($encoded_file_path);

.....

my $call_start = "command --set '$action' ";
my $encoding = $converter->get_conf('MESSAGE_ENCODING');
if (defined($encoding)) @{
  $encoded_call_start = encode($encoding, $call_start);
@} else @{
  $encoded_call_start = $call_start;
@}
my $encoded_call = $encoded_call_start . $encoded_file_path;
my $call = $call_start . $file_name;
if (system($encoded_call)) @{
 $converter->document_error($converter,
     sprintf(__("command did not succeed: %s"),
            $call));
@}
@end example


@node Decoding File Path Strings
@subsection Decoding File Path Strings

The binary strings that could be accessed correspond to the customization
variables strings or arrays @code{INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES}, @code{CSS_FILES},
@code{MACRO_EXPAND} and @code{INTERNAL_LINKS}.  If they need to be decoded into
character strings, for example to appear in error messages, it is possible to
use the @code{COMMAND_LINE_ENCODING} customization variable value as
encoding name to mimic how the decoding of these strings from the command line
is done in the main program and in the converters.  For example:

@example
my $macro_expand_fname = $self->get_conf('MACRO_EXPAND');
my $encoding = $self->get_conf('COMMAND_LINE_ENCODING');
if (defined($encoding)) @{
  $macro_expand_fname = Encode::decode($encoding, $macro_expand_fname);
@}
@end example

@uref{https://perldoc.perl.org/perlunifaq, perlunifaq}.


@node Setting the Context for Conversion
@section Setting the Context for Conversion

Special container types are recognized by the converter and can
be used to convert a Texinfo tree in a specific context.  Those
types cannot appear in a regular Texinfo tree.  They can be the
type directly associated with a text element, or the type of a tree
root element.

The types are:

@table @code
@item _code
In this container, the conversion is done in a code context
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item _converted
In this container, the texts are considered to be already formatted.
This is more likely to be relevant as the type of a text element.

@item _string
In this container, the conversion is done in a string context.
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@end table

These contexts are typically used together with converter conversion
functions (@pxref{Converter Object and Conversion Functions}).
For example:

@example
my @@contents = @@@{$element->@{'contents'@}@};
push @@contents, @{'text' => ' <code>HTML</code> text ',
                   'type' => '_converted'@};
my $result = $converter->convert_tree(@{'type' => '_code',
                                  'contents' => \@@contents @});
@end example

There is no context for plain text, but the conversion to plain
text can be achieved by using the @code{Texinfo::Text} converter
(@pxref{Texinfo::Convert::Text,,,texi2any_internals}).  For example,
to convert the Texinfo tree element @var{$element} to plain text:

@example
my $plaintext = Texinfo::Convert::Text::convert_to_text($element,
  Texinfo::Convert::Text::copy_options_for_convert_text($converter, 1));
@end example

@node Conversion Customization Variables
@section Setting and Getting Conversion Customization Variables

The customization variables values set during the conversion process may be
different from the main program customization variables.  The general rule is
that variables set in the main program, in particular from init files, are
passed to the converter.  Some variables, however, only appear in the
converter. Some variables are also set in the converter based on the main
program customization variables.  Finally, some variables should be set or reset
during conversion, in particular when converting the tree representing the
Texinfo document, when expanding the tree element corresponding to @@-commands
associated with customization variables
(@pxref{Customization Variables for @@-Commands,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

The functions described here should be used in user defined functions, but
should not be used out of functions. Conversely, the similar functions used to
set customization variables from init files without a converter should not be
used in functions, but should be used out of functions in init files
(@pxref{Managing Customization Variables}).

To get the value of a variable in a converter @code{$converter},
the function is @code{get_conf}:

@defun @var{$converter}->get_conf ($variable_name)
@var{$variable_name} is the name of the variable; its value in the converter
@var{$converter} (possibly @code{undef}) is returned.
@end defun

For example:

@example
my $footnotestyle = $converter->get_conf('footnotestyle');
@end example

To set a variable in a converter @code{$converter},
the function is @code{set_conf}:

@defun @var{$converter}->set_conf ($variable_name, $variable_value)
@var{$variable_name} is the name of the variable; its value in the converter
@var{$converter} is set to @var{$variable_value}.  The @var{$variable_name}
value will not be overidden if it was set from the command line or from an init
file.
@end defun

For example:

@example
$converter->set_conf('footnotestyle', 'separate');
@end example

Some customization variables, in particular those associated with @@-commands,
can be reset to the value they had before starting the conversion.  For
example, they are reset in order to obtain their value before the conversion.
Thet are also reset to the value they had before starting the conversion when
their value at the end of the preambule or at the end of the document is
needed, but there are no @@-commands at those locations in the Texinfo manual.
If a value set by @code{set_conf} is intended to be found when the
customization variable value is reset, @code{set_conf} should be called early.
For example, when called from a user-defined function called at different
stage, it should be called in the @samp{setup} stage (@pxref{Init File Calling
at Different Stages}).

The values set in converter with @code{set_conf} will not override command-line
set customization variables, nor variables set early in init files.  This is the
expected behaviour, in particular when the values are set from the document.
In the rare cases when overriding the customization would be needed, the
@code{force_conf} function can be used:

@defun @var{$converter}->force_conf ($variable_name, $variable_value)
@var{$variable_name} is the name of the variable; its value in the converter
@var{$converter} is set to @var{$variable_value}, overriding any previous value.
@end defun


@node Conversion General Information
@section Conversion General Information

Some general information is available from the converter.

To determine if an output format such as @samp{html} or @samp{tex}
is expanded (@pxref{Conditional Commands,,, texinfo, Texinfo}), use
@code{is_format_expanded}:

@deftypefun {@var{$is_format_expanded} =} @var{$converter}->is_format_expanded (@var{$format})
Return true if format @var{$format} is expanded, according to
command-line and init file information.
@end deftypefun

The main method to get information from the converter is @code{get_info}:

@deftypefun {@var{$info} =} @var{$converter}->get_info (@var{$item})
Return information on @var{$item}.
@end deftypefun

The available information is about:
@table @code
@item copying_comment
Text appearing in @code{@@copying} with all the Texinfo commands
put into comments (@pxref{@code{@@copying},,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

@item current_filename
The file name of the current document unit being converted.

@item destination_directory
Destination directory for the output files.  It is common to use that string in directory
or file paths with functions requiring binary strings.  In that case the
character string needs to be encoded.  @xref{Encoding File Path Strings}.

@item document_name
Base name of the document.  It is common to use that string in in directory or
file paths with functions requiring binary strings.  In that case the character
string needs to be encoded.  @xref{Encoding File Path Strings}.

@item documentdescription_string
@code{@@documentdescription} argument converted in a string context
(@pxref{@code{@@documentdescription},,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  @xref{Init File
Expansion Contexts}.

@item floats
Information on floats. Gathered from the Texinfo parsing result.
@xref{Texinfo::Parser $float_types = floats_information($parser),,
Texinfo::Parser::floats_information,texi2any_internals}.

@item global_commands
Global commands information.  Gathered from the Texinfo parsing result.

@item indices_information
Information about defined indices, merged indices and index entries.
@xref{Texinfo@asis{::}Parser $indices_information = $parser->indices_information(),,Texinfo@asis{::}Parser@asis{::}indices_information,texi2any_internals}.

@item jslicenses
An hash reference with  categories of javascript used in the document
as keys. The corresponding values are also hashes with file names
as keys and with array references as values.  The array references contain
information on each of the file licences, with content
@enumerate
@item licence name
@item license URL
@item file name or source of file
@end enumerate

@item labels
Association of identifiers to label elements. Gathered from the Texinfo
parsing result.

space character or the corresponding numeric entity based on
@code{ENABLE_ENCODING} and @code{USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY} customization variables
values.

@item paragraph_symbol
Paragraph symbol, can be @samp{&para;}, but also the corresponding numeric entity
or encoded character based on @code{ENABLE_ENCODING} and
@code{USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY} customization variables values.

@item title_string
@item title_tree
@item simpletitle_tree
@item simpletitle_command_name
Some information is deduced from the title commands:
@dfn{simpletitle} reflects @code{@@settitle} vs.@:
@code{@@shorttitlepage}, and @dfn{title} is constructed by trying
all the title-related commands, including @code{@@top} and
@code{@@titlefont}, in the top element.

@code{title_tree} is a Texinfo tree corresponding to the title,
@code{title_string} is the result of the conversion in a string context
(@pxref{Init File Expansion Contexts}).  @code{simpletitle_tree} is
a Texinfo tree corresponding to the simpletitle, and @code{simpletitle_command_name}
is the @@-command name used for the simpletitle, without the leading @@.

@item structuring
Information on the document structure.  Gathered before the conversion.
Two hash keys correspond to interesting information, @code{sectioning_root}
which points to the top level sectioning command tree element, and
@code{sections_list} which holds the list of the sectioning commands in the
document.

@item title_titlepage
The formatted title, possibly based on @code{@@titlepage}, or on
@code{simpletitle_tree} and similar information, depending on @code{SHOW_TITLE}
and @code{USE_TITLEPAGE_FOR_TITLE} customization variables in the default case.

@node Customizing Output-Related Names
@chapter Customizing Output-Related Names

It is possible to control both output file names and target
identifiers in detail.

User defined functions customizing
file names and targets are registered with
@code{texinfo_register_file_id_setting_function}:

@defun texinfo_register_file_id_setting_function ($customized, \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$customized} is a string describing what the function
should set.  @var{\&handler} should be a reference on the user
defined function.  The different functions that can be registered
have different arguments and return values.
@end defun

The different possibilities for the customized information
are explained in the next sections.

For example:
@example
sub my_node_file_name($$$) @{
  my ($converter, $element, $filename) = @@_;
  # ....
  return $node_file_name
@}

texinfo_register_file_id_setting_function('node_file_name',
                                          \&my_node_file_name);

@node Customizing Output File Names
@section Customizing Output File Names

@cindex Customizing output file names
@cindex Output file names, customizing

@vindex PREFIX
@vindex SUBDIR
@vindex EXTENSION
It is possible to specify the output file names with more control than
merely the command line option @option{--output} (@pxref{Invoking
@command{texi2any},,, texinfo, Texinfo}). The @code{PREFIX} customization
variable overrides the base name of the file given by @code{@@setfilename} or
the file name and should not contain any directory components.  To alter
intermediate directories, use the @code{SUBDIR} customization variable.
Finally, the extension may also be overriden by the customization variable
@code{EXTENSION}.  This variable should be @code{undef} if no extension is to
be added.

@vindex TOP_FILE
Furthermore, the customization variables @code{TOP_FILE} override
the output file name for the top element.

Two function references registered with @code{texinfo_register_file_id_setting_function}
enable further customization.  The first,
@code{node_file_name} is used to customize the nodes files names.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$node_file} node_file_name (@var{$converter}, @
                                      @var{\%node_element}, @var{$file_name})
@var{$converter} is a converter object.  @var{\%node_element} is the Texinfo tree
element corresponding to the @code{@@node}.  @var{$file_name} is the node file
name that has been already set.  The function should return the node file name
(@var{$node_file}).
@end deftypefn

The other function reference, @code{tree_unit_file_name}, is used to
customize the file names associated with each normal element unit
(@pxref{Output Element Units}).

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(@var{$file}, @var{$path})} tree_unit_file_name (@var{$converter}, @
                  @var{\%unit_element}, @var{$file_name}, @var{$file_path})
@var{$converter} is a converter object.  @var{\%unit_element} is the Texinfo
element corresponding to the unit element.  @var{$file_name} is the file
name that has been already set.  @var{$file_path} is the file path that has
been already set.  @var{$file_path} is @samp{undef} if the file is relative to
the output directory, which is the case if the output is split.  The
function should return the file name for the unit element, @var{$file}, and the
file path for the unit element, @var{$path}, which should be @samp{undef} if
the file path is to be constructed by putting @var{$file} in the destination
directory.
@end deftypefn

In the user defined functions, the information that a unit element
is associated with @code{@@top} or @code{@@node Top} or more generally
considered to be the Top element may be determined with
@example
$converter->element_is_tree_unit_top(\%unit_element);
@end example

The information on tree elements may be interesting for those functions
(@pxref{Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions}).  The @code{extra}
key @code{associated_section} of a node element and @code{associated_node}
of a sectioning command element may also be useful.

The file name associated to a sectioning command is set together with
the target, and is described in the next section.

@node Customizing Output Target Names
@section Customizing Output Target Names

@cindex Customizing output target names
@cindex Target names, customizing
@cindex Id names, customizing

Similar to file names, so-called target and id names may be set.  The
@dfn{id} is placed where the item is located, while the @dfn{target}
is used to construct references to that item.  The id and target
are the same.  A function used to set both target and file name is also
described here.

@c xx, but not always, for example in the default case, the
@c xx target for a section is the node id.

The following function reference is for target items (nodes, anchors,
floats), including for external manuals:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$target} label_target_name @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{$normalized}, @var{\@@node_contents}, @var{$default_target})
@var{$converter} is a converter object.  @var{$normalized} is the
normalized node name, @var{\@@node_contents} is a reference on an
array containing the Texinfo tree contents of the command label.
@var{$default_target} is the target that has been already set.  The function
should return the target (@var{$target}).
@end deftypefn

The element corresponding to the label can be found with @code{label_command}
if the label corresponds to an internal reference
(@pxref{Target Commands Links@comma{} Texts and Associated Commands}):
@example
my $element;
$element = $converter->label_command($normalized)
  if (defined($normalized));
@end example

For sectioning commands, in addition to the sectioning command target,
targets for the sectioning command in table of contents and in short table
of contents are needed. The following function reference is for sectioning command related
target and file name:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(@var{$target}, @var{$target_contents}, @var{$target_shortcontents}, @var{$file})} @
 sectioning_command_target_name (@var{$converter}, @var{\%section_element}, @var{$default_target}, @
    @var{$default_target_contents}, @var{$default_target_shortcontents}, @var{$file_name})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{\%section_element} is the Texinfo
element corresponding to the sectioning command.

@var{$default_target}, @var{$default_target_contents} and
@var{$default_target_shortcontents} are the targets that have been already set
for the sectioning element and the sectioning element in table of contents and in
short table of contents.  @var{$file_name} is the file name that has been already set.

The function should return the @var{$target}, @var{$target_contents} and
@var{$target_shortcontents} sectioning element target and sectioning element in
table of contents and in short table of contents targets, and the file name for
the sectioning element (@var{$file}).
@end deftypefn


@node Customizing External Node Output Names
@section Customizing External Node Output Names

In the default case references to external nodes are set as described
in the Texinfo manual (@pxref{HTML Xref,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).  Some
customization is already possible for external manuals URLs as explained in
the Texinfo manual (@pxref{HTML Xref Configuration,,, texinfo, Texinfo}),
and by setting @code{EXTERNAL_CROSSREF_SPLIT},
@code{EXTERNAL_CROSSREF_EXTENSION}, @code{EXTERNAL_DIR},
@code{TOP_NODE_FILE_TARGET} or @code{IGNORE_REF_TO_TOP_NODE_UP}
(@pxref{HTML Customization Variables,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

If the external reference is not already ignored because of
@code{IGNORE_REF_TO_TOP_NODE_UP}, two function references give
full control over the external node target output names, with
@code{external_target_split_name} if the external target is considered
to be split, and @code{external_target_non_split_name} if the external
target is non split.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(@var{$target}, @var{$host_directory}, @var{$file_name})} @
  external_target_split_name(@var{$converter}, @var{$normalized}, @var{\@@node_contents}, @var{$default_target}, @
    @var{$default_host_directory}, @var{$default_file_name})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$normalized} is the
normalized node name, @var{\@@node_contents} is a reference
on an array containing the Texinfo tree contents of the external target.

@var{$default_target}, @var{$default_host_directory} and
@var{$default_file_name} are the target, host and directory URL part and file name
URL part that have been already set.

The function should return the @var{$target}, @var{$host_directory} and
@var{$file_name} URL parts.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(@var{$target}, @var{$host_directory_file})} @
  external_target_non_split_name(@var{$converter}, @var{$normalized}, @var{\@@node_contents}, @var{$default_target}, @
    @var{$default_host_directory_file})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$normalized} is the
normalized node name, @var{\@@node_contents} is a reference
on an array containing the Texinfo tree contents of the external target.

@var{$default_target} is the target and @var{$default_host_directory_file}
is the host and file name part of the URL that have been already
set.

The function should return the @var{$target} and @var{$host_directory_file}
URL parts.
@end deftypefn


@node Customizing Special Elements Output Names
@section Customizing Special Elements Output Names

@cindex Special Elements target names, customizing
@cindex Special Elements id names, customizing
@cindex Special Elements file names, customizing

For special element units file and target (@pxref{Output Element Units}), the
function reference is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} {(@var{$target}, @var{$file})} special_element_target_file_name @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{\%element}, @var{$default_target}, @var{$file_name})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{\%element} is the Texinfo
element corresponding to the special element unit. @var{$default_target} is the
target that has been already set, and @var{$file_name} is the
file name that has been already set. The function should return the @var{$target}
and @var{$file}.
@end deftypefn

To determine the variety of the special element processed, the @code{extra}
hash @code{special_element_variety} key can be used.
@xref{Special Elements Varieties}.


@node Init File Calling at Different Stages
@chapter Init File Calling at Different Stages

@cindex Init file calling functions at different stages
@cindex Calling functions at different stages
@cindex Functions, calling at different stages

Arbitrary user-defined functions may be called during conversion.
This could be used, for example, to initialize variables and collect
some @@-commands text, and doing clean-up after the Texinfo tree
conversion.

There are four places for user defined functions:
@table @code
@item setup
Called right after completing main program customization information
with converter specific customization information, but before anything else is
done, including collecting the output files names and registering the
customization variables pre-conversion values.
@c the information on input file names directories is probably available
@c somewhere, but we do not want those to be used, in general, rather
@c we mostly want document_name to be used
@c  The input file names'directories are available.

@item structure
Called after setting and determining information on CSS, output files and directories,
document structure and associated directions, file names, labels and links for nodes,
sectioning commands, special elements, footnotes and index entries.

@item init
Called after some gathering of global information on the document,
such as titles, copying comment and document description, which
require some conversion of Texinfo, right before the main output processing.
At that point most of the information available from the converter is set
(@pxref{Conversion General Information}).

@item finish
Called after output generation is finished.
@end table

The function used to register a user defined functions is
@code{texinfo_register_handler}:

@defun texinfo_register_handler ($stage, \@ampchar{}handler, $priority)
@var{$stage} is one of the stages described just above. @var{\&handler}
is a reference on the user defined function. @var{$priority}
is an optional priority class.

To determine the order of
user defined functions calls, the priority classes are sorted, and
within a priority class the order is the order of calling
@code{texinfo_register_handler}.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$status} stage_handler @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{\%tree}, @var{$stage})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{\%tree} is the Texinfo
tree root element. @var{$stage} is the current stage.

If @var{$status} is not 0 it means that an error occured.
If @var{$status} is positive, the user defined functions should
have registered an error or warning message, for example with
@code{document_error} (@pxref{Error Reporting in User Defined Functions}).
If @var{$status} is negative, the converter will emit a non specific
error message.  If the @var{$status} is lower than
-@code{HANDLER_FATAL_ERROR_LEVEL} or
higher than @code{HANDLER_FATAL_ERROR_LEVEL}, the processing stops
immediately.  Default value for @code{HANDLER_FATAL_ERROR_LEVEL}
is 100.
@end deftypefn


@node User Defined Functions in Conversion
@chapter User Defined Functions in Conversion

Full customization of output is achieved with replacing default
formatting functions with user defined functions.  There
are two broad classes of functions, the @dfn{conversion} functions used
for elements of the Texinfo tree, and other @dfn{formatting} functions with
diverse purposes, including formatting that are not based on
tree elements (for example beginning and end of file formatting).


@node Tree Element Conversion Functions
@section Tree Element Conversion Functions

Functions used for tree elements associated with @@-commands are
considered separately from functions used for tree elements not
associated with @@-commands, which includes containers with a type
and text.  There are two functions for each element command or
type, one called when the element is first encountered, and the other
called after formatting the contents of the element.  The actual
conversion is usually done after formatting the contents of the element,
but it may sometime be necessary to have some code run when
the element is first encountered.

For @@-commands with both a command name and a type, the type is used
as selector for the formating function for @code{def_line},
@code{definfoenclose_command} and @code{index_entry_command} types.


@node Command Tree Element Opening Functions
@subsection Command Tree Element Opening Functions

User defined functions called when an @@-command element is first encountered are registered
with @code{texinfo_register_command_opening}:

@defun texinfo_register_command_opening ($command_name, \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$command_name} is an @@-command name, with the leading @@.
@var{\&handler} is the user defined function reference.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} command_open @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$command_name}
is the @@-command name without the @@. @var{\%element} is the Texinfo
element.

The @var{$text} returned is prepended to the formatting of the
@@-command.
@end deftypefn

It is possible to have access to the default opening function reference.
The function used is:
@deftypefun {@var{\&default_command_open} =} @var{$converter}->default_command_open (@var{$command_name})
@var{$command_name} is the @@-command name without the @@. Returns the
default opening function reference for @var{$command_name}, or @samp{undef} if there is none.
@end deftypefun


@node Command Tree Element Conversion Functions
@subsection Command Tree Element Conversion Functions

User defined functions called for an @@-command element conversion, after
arguments and contents have been formatted, are registered with
@code{texinfo_register_command_formatting}:

@defun texinfo_register_command_formatting ($command_name, \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$command_name} is an @@-command name, with the leading @@.
@var{\&handler} is the user defined function reference.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} command_conversion  @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element}, @var{\@@args}, @var{$content})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$command_name}
is the @@-command name without the @@. @var{\%element} is the Texinfo
element.

@var{\@@args}, if defined, is a reference on the formatted arguments
of the @@-command. Each of the array items correspond to each of
the @@-command argument. Each array item is a hash references, with keys
corresponding to possible argument formatting contexts:

@table @code
@item normal
Argument formatted in a normal context

@item monospace
Argument formatted in a context where spaces are kept as is, as well as
quotes and minus characters, for instance in @samp{--} and @samp{``}.  Both
in preformatted and code context.  @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item monospacestring
Same as monospace, but in addition in string context. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item monospacetext
Same as monospace, but in addition the argument is converted to plain
text.  @xref{Converter Object and Conversion Functions}.

@item filenametext
Same as monospacetext, but in addition the document encoding is used
to convert accented letters and special insertion @@-commands to plain
text even if @code{ENABLE_ENCODING} is unset.

@item raw
Text is kept as is, special HTML characters are not protected.  Appears only
as @code{@@inlineraw} second argument.

@item string
In string context. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

@item tree
The Texinfo tree element corresponding to the argument.
@xref{Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions}.

@item url
Similar with filenametext.  The difference is that UTF-8 encoding is always
used for the conversion of accented and special insertion @@-commands to plain
text.  This is best for percent encoding of URLs, which should always be
produced from UTF-8 encoded strings.

@end table

The formatted arguments contexts depend on the @@-command, there could be none,
for @code{@@footnote} argument which is not directly converted where the
footnote command is, or multiple, for example for the fourth argument of
@code{@@image} which is both available as @samp{normal} and
@samp{string}.

For example, @code{$args->[0]->@{'normal'@}} is the first argument converted in
normal context.

@var{$content} is the @@-command formatted contents.  It corresponds to the
contents of block @@-commands, and to Texinfo code following @code{@@node},
sectioning commands, @code{@@tab} and @code{@@item} in @code{@@enumerate} and
@code{@@itemize}.  @var{$content} can be @code{undef} or the empty string.

The @var{$text} returned is the result of the @@-command conversion.
@end deftypefn

To call a conversion function from user defined code, the function reference
should first be retrieved using @code{command_conversion}:

@deftypefun {@var{\&command_conversion} =} @var{$converter}->command_conversion (@var{$command_name})
@var{$command_name} is the @@-command name without the @@. Returns the
conversion function reference for @var{$command_name}, or @samp{undef} if there is none,
which should only be the case for @@-commands ignored in HTML not defined by the user.
@end deftypefun

for example, to call the conversion function for the @code{@@tab} @@-command,
passing arguments that may correspond to another @@-command:
@example
&@{$converter->command_conversion('tab')@}($converter, $cmdname,
                                     $command, $args, $content);
@end example

It is possible to have access to the default conversion function reference.
The function used is:

@deftypefun {@var{\&default_command_conversion} =} @var{$converter}->default_command_conversion (@var{$command_name})
@var{$command_name} is the @@-command name without the @@. Returns the
default conversion function reference for @var{$command_name}, or @samp{undef} if there is none,
which should only be the case for @@-commands ignored in HTML.
@end deftypefun


@node Type Tree Element Opening Functions
@subsection Type Tree Element Opening Functions

User defined functions called when an element without @@-command
with a container type is first encountered are registered
with @code{texinfo_register_type_opening}:

@defun texinfo_register_type_opening ($type, \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$type} is the element type.
@var{\&handler} is the user defined function reference.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} type_open (@var{$converter}, @
        @var{$type}, @var{\%element})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$type} is the element type.
@var{\%element} is the Texinfo
element.

The @var{$text} returned is prepended to the formatting of the
type container.
@end deftypefn

It is possible to have access to the default opening function reference.
The function used is:
@deftypefun {@var{\&default_type_open} =} @var{$converter}->default_type_open (@var{$type})
@var{$command_name} is the element type. Returns the
default opening function reference for @var{$type}, or @samp{undef} if there is none.
@end deftypefun


@node Type Tree Element Conversion Functions
@subsection Type Tree Element Conversion Functions

User defined functions called for the conversion of an element without
@@-command with text or a container type are registered with
@code{texinfo_register_type_formatting}.  For containers, the user defined
function is called after conversion of the content.

@defun texinfo_register_type_formatting ($type, \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$type} is the element type.
@var{\&handler} is the user defined function reference.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} type_conversion (@var{$converter}, @
        @var{$type}, @var{\%element}, @var{$content})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$type} is the element type.
@var{\%element} is the Texinfo element.  @var{$content} is text for elements
associated with text, or the formatted contents for other elements.
@var{$content} can be @code{undef} or the empty string.

The @var{$text} returned is the result of the @@-command conversion.
@end deftypefn

To call a conversion function from user defined code, the function reference
should first be retrieved using @code{type_conversion}:

@deftypefun {@var{\&type_conversion} =} @var{$converter}->type_conversion (@var{$type})
@var{$type} is the element type.  Returns the
conversion function reference for @var{$type}, or @samp{undef} if there is none,
which should only be the case for types ignored in HTML not defined by the user.
@end deftypefun

It is possible to have access to the default conversion function reference.
The function used is:

@deftypefun {@var{\&default_type_conversion} =} @var{$converter}->default_type_conversion (@var{$type})
@var{$type} is the element type.  Returns the
default conversion function reference for @var{$type}, or @samp{undef} if there is none,
which should only be the case for types ignored in HTML.
@end deftypefun


@node Formatting Functions
@section Formatting Functions

Most formatting functions are specific, with specific arguments,
and a specific item formatted.

User defined functions associated with
the formatting of special elements body (@pxref{Output Element Units})
are handled separately.

The formatting functions are often called from function that can be
replaced by a user defined function, therefore these functions may
not be called if the replacement functions do not keep a similar
operation.


@node Specific formating Functions
@subsection Specific formating Functions

User defined formatting functions are registered with
@code{texinfo_register_formatting_function}:

@defun texinfo_register_formatting_function ($formatted, @
                            \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$formatted} is a string describing the formatting
function. @var{\&handler} is the user defined function reference.
@end defun

To call a formatting function from user defined code, the
function reference should first be retrieved using @code{formatting_function}:

@deftypefun {@var{\&formatting_function} =} @var{$converter}->formatting_function (@var{$formatted})
@var{$formatted} is a string describing the formatting
function. Returns the associated formatting function reference.
@end deftypefun

It is possible to have access to the default formatting function reference.
The function used is:

@deftypefun {@var{\&default_formatting_function} =} @var{$converter}->default_formatting_function (@var{$formatted})
@var{$formatted} is a string describing the formatting
function. Returns the default formatting function reference.
@end deftypefun

The string that should be used to register or call each of the formatting functions
and the call of the formatting functions are documented in the following sections of
the manual, depending on where they are relevant.


@node Mandatory Conversion Function Calls
@chapter Mandatory Conversion Function Calls

There are several conventions and constraints that user defined code should
abide to, in order to comply with customization option values, and also
to have information correctly registered in the converter.


@node Protection of URLs
@section Protection of URLs

URLs need to be ``percent-encoded'' to protect non-ASCII characters, spaces and
other ASCII characters.  Percent-encoding also allows to have characters be
interpreted as part of a path and not as characters with a special role in
URLs.  For example, @samp{?} has a special role in URLs as it starts a query
string.  To have it considered as part of a file path, instead of a marker of
the beginning of a query, it needs to be percent encoded.

To protect a whole URL, in which characters with a special role in URL
are left as is, use @code{url_protect_url_text}.  To protect file path in URL,
including characters with a special role in URLs,
use @code{url_protect_file_text}.

@deftypefun {@var{$protected_url} =} @var{$converter}->url_protect_url_text(@var{$input_string})
Percent-encode @var{$input_string}, leaving as is all the characters with a
special role in URLs, such as @samp{:}, @samp{/}, @samp{?}, @samp{&}, @samp{#}
or @samp{%} (and a few other).  HTML reserved characters and form feeds
protected are also protected as entities (@pxref{Basic Formatting
Customization,,@code{format_protect_text}}).  This is typically used on
complete URLs pointing to diverse internet resources, such as the @code{@@url}
URL argument.

for example
@example
return $self->html_attribute_class('a', [$cmdname])
     .' href="'.$self->url_protect_url_text($url)."\">$text</a>";
@end example
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {@var{$protected_path} =} @var{$converter}->url_protect_file_text(@var{$input_string})
Percent-encode @var{$input_string} leaving as is character appearing in file
paths only, such as @samp{/}, @samp{.}, @samp{-} or @samp{_}.  All the other
characters that can be percent-protected are protected, including characters
with a special role in URLs.  For example, @samp{?}, @samp{&} and @samp{%} are
percent-protected.  HTML reserved characters and form feeds protected are also
protected as entities (@pxref{Basic Formatting Customization,,
@code{format_protect_text}}).  This is typically used on file names
corresponding to actual files, used in the path portion of an URL, such as the
image file path in @code{@@image}.

For example
@example
$self->html_attribute_class('img', [$cmdname])
   . ' src="'.$self->url_protect_file_text($image_file)."\");
@end example
@end deftypefun


@node Formatting HTML Element with Classes
@section Formatting HTML Element with Classes

Opening an HTML element with one or more classes should always be done through
@code{html_attribute_class}:

@deftypefun {@var{$element_open} =} @var{$converter}->html_attribute_class @
                              (@var{$html_element}, @var{\@@classes})
Formats the beginning of an HTML element @var{$html_element}.  @var{\@@classes}
is the list of classes for this element.  The element opening returned does not
include the end of element symbol @samp{>} such that it is possible to add
more attributes.

If the HTML element is @code{span}, an empty string is returned if there
is also no attribute.

If @code{NO_CSS} is set, no attribute is set for the element.  Otherwise
a @code{class} attribute is set based on @var{\@@classes }. If
@code{INLINE_CSS_STYLE} is set, a CSS style attribute based on
CSS element class rules is also added.  Otherwise the information that
the element class was seen is registered by the converter.
@end deftypefun

Examples of use:
@example
my $open = $converter->html_attribute_class('span', ['category-def']);
$category_result = $open.'>'.$category_result.'</span>'
  if ($open ne '');

my $result = $converter->html_attribute_class('em', [$cmdname, 'jax_p'])
     . '>' . $content . '</em>';
@end example


@node Closing Lone HTML Element
@section Closing Lone HTML Element

HTML elements with an opening element, but no closing element,
such as @code{<img>} or @code{<link>} should be closed by calling
@code{close_html_lone_element}:

@deftypefun {@var{$html_element} =} @var{$converter}->close_html_lone_element @
                                                     (@var{$unclosed_element})
Close the @var{$unclosed_element}, which can contain attributes, by prepending
@samp{>} or @samp{/>} depending on the @code{USE_XML_SYNTAX} customization
variable value.
@end deftypefun

Examples of use:
@example
$description = $converter->close_html_lone_element(
    "<meta name=\"description\" content=\"$description\"");
@end example


@node Substituting Non Breaking Space
@section Substituting Non Breaking Space

If a @code{&nbsp;} can appear in formatted code,
the corresponding text should be in a call to @code{substitute_html_non_breaking_space},
to take into account @code{ENABLE_ENCODING} and @code{USE_NUMERIC_ENTITY}
customization variables:

@deftypefun {@var{$substituted_text} =} @var{$converter}->substitute_html_non_breaking_space @
                                                    (@var{$formatted_text})
Substitute @code{&nbsp;} according to customization variables values.
@end deftypefun

This is not needed if the @code{non_breaking_space} information is taken from
the general information (@pxref{Conversion General Information}).


@node Conversion in String Context
@section Conversion in String Context

Conversion and formatting functions should check if in string
context to avoid using HTML elements in formatting when in string context.
@xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

To determine if in string context, the functions is @code{in_string}:

@deftypefun {@var{$in_string} =} @var{$converter}->in_string ()
Return true if in string context.
@end deftypefun

Example of use:

@example
if ($converter->in_string()) @{
  return "$mail_string ($text)";
@} else @{
  return $converter->html_attribute_class('a', [$cmdname])
                      ." href=\"mailto:$mail_string\">$text</a>";
@}
@end example


@node Conversion in Preformatted Context
@section Conversion in Preformatted Context

Conversion and formatting functions should test if in preformatted
context to convert accordingly. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.

To determine if in preformatted context, the functions is @code{in_preformatted}:

@deftypefun {@var{$in_preformatted} =} @var{$converter}->in_preformatted ()
Return true if in preformatted context.
@end deftypefun

If in preformatted context, it is possible to get preformatted @@-commands and
preformatted types nesting with @code{preformatted_classes_stack}:

@deftypefun {@var{@@preformatted_nesting} =} @var{$converter}->preformatted_classes_stack ()
Returns an array containing the block preformatted @@-commands such as
@code{@@example}, @code{@@display} or @code{@@menu} names without the leading
@@ and the HTML attribute class preformatted container names, in order of appearance.
@end deftypefun

The @code{%Texinfo::Commands::preformatted_code_commands}
hash can be used to determine if a preformatted command is to be formatted
as code (@pxref{Texinfo::Commands %preformatted_code_commands,,,
texi2any_internals}).

@example
my @@pre_classes = $converter->preformatted_classes_stack();
foreach my $pre_class (@@pre_classes) @{
  if ($Texinfo::Commands::preformatted_code_commands@{$pre_class@}) @{
    $result = '<code>' .$result. '</code>';
    last;
  @}
@}
@end example

@xref{Simple Customization of Containers} on customizing containers preformatted class.


@node Text Formatting Context
@section Text Formatting Context

Formatting of text requires to use additional informative functions on specific
contexts only relevant for text.  User defined functions should convert the text
according to the context.

Each context is associated with a function:

@table @emph
@item code

@deftypefun {@var{$in_code} =} @var{$converter}->in_code ()
Return true if in code context.  @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.
@end deftypefun

@item math

@deftypefun {@var{$in_math} =} @var{$converter}->in_math ()
Return true if in math context. @xref{Init File Expansion Contexts}.
@end deftypefun

@item raw

@deftypefun {@var{$in_raw} =} @var{$converter}->in_raw ()
Return true if in raw format, in @code{@@inlineraw} or in @code{@@html}.
In such a context, text should be kept as is and special HTML characters should
not be protected.
@end deftypefun

@item verbatim

@deftypefun {@var{$in_verbatim} =} @var{$converter}->in_verbatim ()
Return true if in verbatim context, corresponding to @code{@@verb} and @code{@@verbatim}.
In general, HTML characters should be protected in this context.
@end deftypefun

@item upper-case

@deftypefun {@var{$in_upper_case} =} @var{$converter}->in_upper_case ()
Return true if in upper-case context, corresponding to @code{@@sc}.
@end deftypefun

@item non-breakable space

@deftypefun {@var{$in_non_breakable_space} =} @var{$converter}->in_non_breakable_space ()
Return true if in context where line breaks are forbidden, corresponding
to @code{@@w}.
@end deftypefun

@item space protected

@deftypefun {@var{$in_space_protected} =} @var{$converter}->in_space_protected ()
Return true if in context where space and newline characters are kept,
corresponding to @code{@@verb}.
@end deftypefun
@end table


@node Basic Formatting Customization
@chapter Basic Formatting Customization

The following formatting functions references handle basic formatting
and are called from diverse formatting and conversion functions. @xref{Specific
formating Functions} for information on how to register and get the functions
references.

All the functions take a converter object as their first argument.

@table @code
@item format_button_icon_img

Called for an active direction, if @code{ICONS} is set, when formatting
the navigation panel (@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}).

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_button_icon_img @
                  (@var{$converter}, @var{$button}, @var{$icon}, @var{$name})
@var{$button} is a button name, typically obtained from the @code{button}
direction string (@pxref{Direction Strings}).
@var{$icon} is an image file name to be used as icon.  @var{$name} is the
direction heading, typically formatted in string context.  @xref{Init File
Expansion Contexts}.

Returns a formatted icon image.
@end deftypefn

@item format_comment

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_comment  @
                                       (@var{$converter}, @var{$input_text})
Return @var{$input_text} in a comment.
@end deftypefn

@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $comment = $converter->xml_comment($text),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::xml_comment,texi2any_internals}.

@item format_heading_text

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_heading_text @
  (@var{$converter}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\@@classes}, @var{$input_text}, @var{$level}, @var{$id}, @var{\%element}, @var{$target})
Returns a heading formatted using @var{$input_text} as heading text, @var{$level}
as heading level, @var{\@@classes} for a class attribute.  @var{$command_name}
gives an information on the @@-command the heading is associated to and can be
@code{undef}, for instance for special elements headings.

@var{$id} is an optional identifier, and @var{\%element} is an optional
Texinfo tree element associated with the heading.  @var{$target} is the
id of the element this heading is referring to.

In the default case, if the @var{$target} or @var{$id} are specified, a
copiable anchor will be generated and injected into the heading.  In the case
both are specified, @var{$id} is preferred over @var{$target}, as it is closer
to the element the user sees the anchor on.
@end deftypefn

This function reference can be called for @code{@@node} and sectioning
commands, heading commands, tree units, special elements and title @@-commands.

A formatted headings is, in the default case, like @code{<h2>@var{$input_text}</h2>}
for a @var{$level} 2 heading.

@item format_program_string

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_program_string (@var{$converter})
This function reference should return the formatted program
string.
@end deftypefn

@item format_protect_text
@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_protect_text  @
                                        (@var{$converter}, @var{$input_text})
Return @var{$input_text} with HTML reserved characters and form feeds
protected.

For performance reasons, this function reference may not be called everywhere
text is protected.  For those cases, the calling function should also be
redefined to call @code{&@{$self->formatting_function('format_protect_text')@}(...)}
instead of another function@footnote{The function called is actually the
function referenced as @code{$self->formatting_function('format_protect_text')}
in the default case, but it is called directly to avoid an indirection}.
@end deftypefn

@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $protected_text = $converter->xml_protect_text($text),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::xml_protect_text,texi2any_internals}.
@item format_separate_anchor

This function reference is called if there is not another HTML element to
add an identifier attribute to.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} format_separate_anchor @
                               (@var{$converter}, @var{$id}, @var{$class})
@var{id} is the identifier.
@var{$class} is an optional class to be used in an HTML class attribute.

Return an anchor with identifier @var{$id}.
@end deftypefn

@node Dynamic Conversion Information
@chapter Dynamic Conversion Information

Dynamic formatting information on the conversion can be obtained from the
converter.

For advanced customization, it is also often necessary to pass information
during conversion between different formatting functions or between
different calls of the same function.

The information is often useful for the formatting of paragraph and
preformatted containers and @@-commands such as @code{@@abbr}, @code{@@footnote},
@code{@@node}, sectioning commands, @code{@@quotation} and @code{@@float}.


@node Dynamic Converter Formatting Information
@section Dynamic Converter Formatting Information


To get the current paragraph and preformatted number, use @code{paragraph_number}
or @code{preformatted_number}:

@deftypefun {@var{$number} =} @var{$converter}->paragraph_number ()
@deftypefunx {@var{$number} =} @var{$converter}->preformatted_number ()
Return the current paragraph or preformatted container number in the
current formatting context.
@end deftypefun

To get the topmost block @@-command being converted, use @code{top_block_command}:
@deftypefun {@var{$command_name} =} @var{$converter}->top_block_command ()
Return the most recent block @@-command seen in the current formatting
context.
@end deftypefun

To get the text filling and alignement context, determined by @code{@@flushleft}
or @code{@@center}, use @code{in_align}:

@deftypefun {@var{$align_context} =} @var{$converter}->in_align ()
If the alignment context is the default alignement context, return @code{undef}.
Otherwise, returns the command name of the alignment context.
@end deftypefun

To determine if the conversion is in a context converted multiple times,
use @code{in_multi_expanded}:
@deftypefun {@var{$multi_expanded_context_information} =} @var{$converter}->in_multi_expanded ()
Return a string representing the multiple expanded context, or @code{undef} if
not in a multiple expanded context.
@end deftypefun

To get the location of an image file, use @code{html_image_file_location_name}:

@deftypefun {(@var{$image_file}, @var{$image_basefile}, @var{$image_extension}, @var{$image_path}, @var{$image_path_encoding}) =} @
 @var{$converter}->html_image_file_location_name (@var{$command_name}, @var{\%element}, @var{\@@args})
@var{$command_name}, @var{\%element} and @var{\@@args} should be the arguments
of an @code{@@image} @@-command formatting (@pxref{Command Tree Element
Conversion Functions}).

The return values gives information on the image file if found, or fallback values.
@var{$image_file} is the relative image file name.  It is the file name used in
formatting of the @code{@@image} command in the default case.  @var{$image_basefile}
is the base file name of the image, without extension, corresponding to the
@code{@@image} @@-command first argument.  @var{$image_extension} is the image
file extension (without a leading dot).  @var{$image_path} is the path to the
actual image file, @code{undef} if no file was found.  @var{$image_path} is
returned as a binary string, the other strings returned are character strings.
@var{$image_path_encoding} is the encoding used to encode the image path to a
binary string.
@end deftypefun

@xref{Conversion in Preformatted Context} for information on getting
preformatted commands and container types nesting information.


@node Opening and Closing Sectioning Commands Extent
@section Opening and Closing Sectioning Commands Extent

In the default formatting, when a sectioning command is encountered, a
@code{<div>} element is opened for the extent of the sectioning command
including its children sectioning commands.  This extent need to be closed
at different places, for instance when another sectioning command
is reached, at the end of a file, or at the end of the document.

The user defined formatting function should take care of
registering and closing opened section levels.  In the default code, registering is
done in the sectioning commands conversion function only.

The function for registering opened section extent is
@code{register_opened_section_level}:

@defun @var{$converter}->register_opened_section_level ($level, $closing_text)
@var{$level} is the sectioning command level.  It is typically
obtained with @code{section->@{'structure'@}->@{'section_level'@}}
(@pxref{Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions}).
@var{$closing_text} is the text that should be output when the
section level @var{$level} is closed.
@end defun

The function for closing registered section extents is
@code{close_registered_sections_level}:

@deftypefun {@var{@@closing_texts} =} @var{$converter}->close_registered_sections_level (@var{$level})
@var{$level} is the sectioning command level.  Opened section are closed
down to section level @var{$level}.  The closing texts are returned in the
@var{@@closing_texts} array in order.
@end deftypefun

Example of use:
@example
@group
my $level = $opening_section->@{'structure'@}->@{'section_level'@};
$result
   .= join('', $converter->close_registered_sections_level($level));
$converter->register_opened_section_level($level, "</div>\n");
@end group
@end example


@node Setting Up Content for the Next Text Container
@section Setting Up Content for the Next Text Container

Text is mainly output in two @dfn{inline} text containers, @code{paragraph} for
text in paragraph and @code{preformatted} for text in preformatted
environments.  The Texinfo code parsing makes sure that it is the case, to
simplify conversion to formats which allow text only in specific environments
such as HTML.

Formatted text may also be prepared based on information from Texinfo
elements tree while out of the inline containers.  For that case, functions
allow to register pending inline formatted content, and get the content to be
prepended in inline text containers.

Pending formatted content text is registered with
@code{register_pending_formatted_inline_content}:

@defun @var{$converter}->register_pending_formatted_inline_content ($category, $content)
@var{$content} is the formatted content to be registered and output
in the next inline container.  @var{$category} is a indicator of the source
of the formatted inline content, mostly used to cancel registered content
if no inline container was seen.
@end defun

Pending formatted content can (and should) be cancelled when it is known that
there is no suitable inline container to be used to output the text.  The
function is @code{cancel_pending_formatted_inline_content}:

@deftypefun {@var{$cancelled_content} =} @var{$converter}->cancel_pending_formatted_inline_content (@var{$category})
Cancel the first @var{$category} pending formatted content text found.
Returns @code{undef} if nothing was cancelled, and the cancelled
content otherwise.
@end deftypefun

Pending formatted content is gathered by calling @code{get_pending_formatted_inline_content}.
In the default case, this is done in inline containers opening
code (@pxref{Type Tree Element Opening Functions}).

@deftypefun {@var{$content} =} @var{$converter}->get_pending_formatted_inline_content ()
Returns the concatenated pending content.
@end deftypefun

The inline containers get the content when they are opened, but are
converted after the formatting of their contents.  Two additional functions
allow to associate pending content to an element,
@code{associate_pending_formatted_inline_content}, and get the associated
content, @code{get_associated_formatted_inline_content}.
@code{associate_pending_formatted_inline_content} is normally called in inline
container opening code, right after
@code{get_pending_formatted_inline_content}, while
@code{get_associated_formatted_inline_content} is called in the inline
container conversion function (@pxref{Type Tree Element Conversion Functions}).

@defun @var{$converter}->associate_pending_formatted_inline_content (\%element, $content)
Associate @var{$content} to the Texinfo tree element @var{\%element}.
@end defun

@deftypefun {@var{$content} =} @var{$converter}->get_associated_formatted_inline_content (@var{\%element})
Get @var{$content} associated to the Texinfo tree element @var{\%element}.
@end deftypefun


@node Associating Information to an Output File
@section Associating Information to an Output File

To be able to retrieve information associated to the current file, in general
for the file begin or end formatting, @code{register_file_information} can  be
used to associate information, and @code{get_file_information} to retrieve that
information.

@defun @var{$converter}->register_file_information ($key, $value)
Associate the current output file name file to the key @var{$key}, itself
associated to the value @var{$value}.
@end defun

@deftypefun {@var{$value} =} @var{$converter}->get_file_information (@var{$key}, @var{$file_name})
Return the value associated to the key @var{$key} and file name @var{$file_name}.
@end deftypefun


@node Shared Conversion State
@section Shared Conversion State

For information shared among formatting functions without involving the
converter, the function @code{shared_conversion_state} can be used both for
initialization of shared information and to share information:

@deftypefun {@var{$reference} =} @var{$converter}->shared_conversion_state (@var{$name}, @var{$initialization})
Return the reference @var{$reference} associated with @var{$name}.
@var{$initialization} is only read the first time @var{$name} is seen and sets
up the reference that will be reused afterwards.  If @var{$initialization} is a
scalar (string or integer, for example), a reference on a scalar is returned,
the associated value being set to @var{$initialization}.  Otherwise,
@var{$initialization} should be a reference on a hash or on an array.
@end deftypefun

The converter is used to hold the information, but does not use nor write.

Examples of use:
@example
my $explained_commands_hash
    = $converter->shared_conversion_state('explained_commands', @{@});
$explained_commands_hash->@{'key'@} = 'value';

my $foot_num_reference
     = $converter->shared_conversion_state('footnote_number', 0);
$@{$foot_num_reference@}++;
@end example


@node Translations Output and Customization
@chapter Translations Output and Customization

Translated strings can be specified in customization functions, for
@@-commands without arguments (@pxref{Simple Customization for Commands
Without Arguments}), for direction strings (@pxref{Direction Strings
Customization}) and for specific elements headings such as footnotes,
contents or about (@pxref{Special Elements Information Customization}).
Translated strings can also be inserted in the output in user-defined
customization functions, by using specific functions for internationalization
of strings, @code{gdt} or @code{pgdt}.

It is possible to customize the translated strings, in order to
change the translations of the strings translated in the default case.
If new translated strings are added, it is even required to use translated
strings customization to add translations for the added strings.

@xref{Internationalization of Document Strings,,, texinfo, Texinfo} for additional
information on the default case.

@node Internationalization of Strings Function
@section Internationalization of Strings Function

@vindex texinfo_document @r{Gettext domain}
The subroutines @code{gdt} or @code{pgdt}, are used for translated strings:

@deftypefun {@var{$translated_tree} =} @var{$converter}->gdt (@var{$string}, @var{\%variables_hash}, @var{$translation_context}, @var{$mode})
@deftypefunx {@var{$translated_tree} =} @var{$converter}->pgdt (@var{$translation_context}, @var{$string}, @var{\%variables_hash}, @var{$mode})
@var{$string} is the string to be translated, @var{\%variables_hash}
is a hash reference holding the variable parts of the translated
string.   @var{$translation_context} is an optional translation context
that limits the search of the translated string to that context
(@pxref{Contexts,,,gettext,GNU gettext tools}).
The result returned is a perl Texinfo tree in the default case.

@var{$mode} is an optional string which may modify how the function behaves. The
possible values are:
@table @code
@item translated_text
In that case the string is not considered to be Texinfo, a plain string
that is returned after translation and substitution. The substitutions
may only be strings in that case.
@end table

If called as @code{pgdt}, @var{$translation_context} is not optional
and is the first argument.
@end deftypefun

When the string is expanded as Texinfo, and converted to a
Texinfo tree in perl, the arguments are substituted; for
example, @samp{@{arg_name@}} is replaced by the corresponding
actual argument, which should be Texinfo perl trees, Texinfo
perl tree contents arrays or strings.

In the following example, @samp{@{date@}}, @samp{@{program_homepage@}}
and @samp{@{program@}} are the arguments of the string.  Since they
are used in @code{@@uref}, their order in the formatted output depends on
the formatting and is not predictable.
@samp{@{date@}}, @samp{@{program_homepage@}} and @samp{@{program@}} are
substituted after the expansion, which means that they should already be
Texinfo perl trees, Texinfo perl tree contents.  A string is turned
into a Texinfo text element without type, with the string as @code{text}.

@example
  $converter->gdt('Generated @@emph@{@@today@{@}@} using '
   .'@@uref@{@{program_homepage@}, @@emph@{@{program@}@}@}.',
      @{ 'program_homepage' => $converter->get_conf('PACKAGE_URL'),
        'program' => @{ 'text' => $converter->get_conf('PROGRAM') @}@}));
@end example

In the example, the @code{$converter->get_conf('PACKAGE_URL')} string is turned
into @code{@{ 'text' => $converter->get_conf('PACKAGE_URL')  @}}.

An example of combining conversion with translation:
@example
$converter->convert_tree($converter->gdt(
       '@{explained_string@} (@{explanation@})',
       @{'explained_string' => @{'type' => '_converted',
                               'text' => $result@},
        'explanation' => @{'type' => '_converted',
                          'text' => $explanation_result@}@}),
                         "convert explained $cmdname");
@end example

In the default case, the @code{gdt} function from the @code{Texinfo::Translations}
module is used for translated strings.  It is possible to use a user-defined
function instead as seen next.  @xref{Texinfo::Translations,,,texi2any_internals} for more
on @code{Texinfo::Translations}.

In @command{texi2any} code, @code{gdt} is also used to mark translated
strings for tools extracting translatable strings to produce template
files.  @code{pgdt} is used to mark translated string with a translation
context associated.


@node Translated Strings Customization
@section Translated Strings Customization

To customize strings translations, register the @code{format_translate_string}
function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$translated_tree} format_translate_string @
  (@var{$converter}, @var{$string}, @var{$lang}, @var{\%variables_hash}, @
  @var{$translation_context}, @var{$mode})
@var{$string} is the string to be translated, @var{$lang} is the language.
@var{$translation_context} is an optional translation context.
@var{$mode} is an optional string which should modify how the function behaves.

The result returned should be a perl Texinfo tree in the default case, or
a string if @var{$mode} is set to @code{translated_text}.
The result returned may also be @samp{undef}, in which case the translation
is done as if the function reference had not been defined.

@xref{Internationalization of Strings Function} for more information on
strings translations function arguments.

The @code{replace_convert_substrings} method of @code{Texinfo::Translations}
can be used to substitute @var{\%variables_hash} and return a Texinfo tree
based on a translated string, taking into account @var{$mode}
(@pxref{Texinfo@asis{::}Translations $tree = $object->replace_convert_substrings($translated_string@comma{} $replaced_substrings@comma{} $mode),,
Texinfo@asis{::}Translations replace_convert_substrings, texi2any_internals}).
@end deftypefn

This function reference is not set in the default case, in the default case
the @code{gdt} method from the @code{Texinfo::Translations} module is
called (@pxref{Internationalization of Strings Function}).
@xref{Specific formating Functions} for information on how to register and get
the function reference.

Here is an example with new translated strings added and definition
of @code{format_translate_string} to translate the strings:

@example
texinfo_register_no_arg_command_formatting('error', undef, undef,
                                                undef, 'error--&gt;');
my %translations = (

texinfo_register_formatting_function('format_translate_string',
                                       \&my_format_translate_string);

@end example


@node Translation Contexts
@section Translation Contexts

Translation contexts may be set to avoid ambiguities for translated
strings, in particular when the strings are short (@pxref{Contexts,,,gettext,
GNU @code{gettext} utilities}).  Translation contexts are set for translated
direction strings (@pxref{Direction Strings}) and for special elements headings
(@pxref{Special Elements Information Customization}).

For direction strings, the translation context is based on the direction
name (@pxref{Directions}), with @samp{direction} prepended and another
string prepended, depending on the type of string:

@table @code
@item button
@samp{button label} is prepended

@item description
@samp{description} is prepended

@item text
@samp{string} is prepended
@end table

For example, the @code{Top} direction @code{button} direction string
translation context is @samp{Top direction button label}.

As an exception, the @code{This} direction has @samp{(current section)}
prepended to have a more explicit translation context.  The @code{This}
direction @code{text} direction string translation context is thus @samp{This
(current section) direction string}.

For special element headings, the translation context is obtained by
prepending @samp{section heading} to the special element variety (@pxref{Special
Elements Varieties}).  For example, the @code{footnotes} special element
variety heading translation context is @samp{footnotes section heading}.

Here is an example, which could be used with the same
function registered as @code{format_translate_string} as in the example above:

@example
texinfo_register_direction_string_info('Forward', 'text', undef,
                                       'Forward');
texinfo_register_special_element_info('heading', 'contents',
                              'The @@emph@{Table of Contents@}');

my %translations = (
  'fr' => @{
         'The @@emph@{Table of Contents@}' => @{'contents section heading'
                       => '@@result@{@} La @@emph@{Table des mati@@`eres@}',@},
         'Forward' => @{'Forward direction string'
                       => 'Vers l\'avant @@result@{@}',@},
          @}
   @dots{}
);

@end example

Other translated strings may also be associated with translation contexts.
The translation template file @file{po_document/texinfo_document.pot}
in the source directory of Texinfo contains the translated strings appearing in
all the output formats.

@item direction
Direction corresponding to the special element. @xref{Directions}.

@item heading
Special element heading Texinfo code.

@item heading_tree
Special element heading Texinfo tree.

@item order
Index determining the sorting order of special elements.

@item file_string
File string portion prepended to the special element file names, such as
@samp{_toc}.

@item target
A string representing the target of the special element, typically used
as id attribute and in href attribute.

@end table

The heading string is set with @code{heading}, and should be a Texinfo code
string.  @code{heading_tree} cannot be set directly, but can be retrieved.
It is determined from @code{heading} after translation and conversion to
a Texinfo tree.

To set the information, use @code{texinfo_register_special_element_info}
in an init file:

@defun texinfo_register_special_element_info ($item_type, @
                           $special_element_variety, $value)
Set @var{$item_type} information for the special element variety
@var{$special_element_variety} to @var{$value}.  @var{$value} may be
@samp{undef}, or an empty string, but only @code{heading} and
@code{target} should be set to that value as a non-empty value is
needed for the other items for formatting.
@end defun

To retrieve the information for formatting, use @code{special_element_info}:

@deftypefun {@var{$list_or_value} =} @var{$converter}->special_element_info @
                  (@var{$item_type}, @var{$special_element_variety})
@var{$item_type} is the type of information to be retrieved as described above.
If @var{$special_element_variety} is @samp{undef}, the list of the special elements
varieties with information for the @var{$item_type} is returned.  If
@var{$special_element_variety} is a special element variety, the corresponding
value is returned.

The value returned is translated and converted to a Texinfo tree
for @samp{heading_tree}.
@end deftypefun


@node Customizing Footnotes
@section Customizing Footnotes

@code{NUMBER_FOOTNOTES} and @code{NO_NUMBER_FOOTNOTE_SYMBOL} customization
variables can be used to change the footnotes formatting.  Redefinition
of @code{@@footnote} conversion reference and footnote formatting
references is needed for further customization.

@code{@@footnote} @@-commands appearing in the Texinfo elements tree
are converted like any other elements associated with @@-commands
(@pxref{Command Tree Element Conversion Functions}).  It is therefore possible
to redefine their formatting by registering a user defined function.

To pass information on footnotes between the conversion function processing the
@code{@@footnote} command at the location they appear in the document and the
functions formatting their argument elsewhere, two functions are available:
@code{register_footnote} to be called where they appear in the document, and
@code{get_pending_footnotes} to be called where they are formatted.

@defun @var{$converter}->register_footnote (\%element, $footnote_id, @
  $foot_in_doc_id, $number_in_doc, $footnote_location_filename, $multi_expanded_region)
@var{\%element} is the footnote texinfo tree element. @var{$footnote_id} is the
identifier for the location where the footnote arguments are expanded.
@var{$foot_in_doc_id} is the identifier for the location where the footnote
appears in the document.  @var{$number_in_doc} is the symbol used to format the
footnote in the document.  @var{$footnote_location_filename} is the filename of
the tree unit element of the footnote in the document. If the footnote appears
in a region that is expanded multiple times, the information on the expansion
is @var{$multi_expanded_region} (@pxref{Dynamic Converter Formatting
Information}).
@end defun

@code{register_footnote} is normally called in the @code{@@footnote}
@@-command conversion function reference.  The default conversion function
also call @code{command_href} to link to the location where the footnote
text will be expanded (@pxref{Target Commands Links@comma{} Texts and Associated Commands}).

@deftypefun {@var{@@pending_footnotes_information} =} @var{$converter}->get_pending_footnotes ()
Returns in @var{@@pending_footnotes_information} the information gathered
in @code{register_footnote}.  Each of the array element in @var{@@pending_footnotes_information}
is an array reference containing the arguments of @code{register_footnote}
in the same order.
@end deftypefun

The formatting of footnotes content is done by the
@code{format_footnotes_sequence} formatting reference
(@pxref{Specific formating Functions}):

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$footnotes_sequence} format_footnotes_sequence @
                                                  (@var{$converter})
Formats and returns the footnotes that need to be formatted.  This function
normally calls @code{get_pending_footnotes}.  The default function also calls
@code{footnote_location_href} (@pxref{Other Links@comma{} Headings and
Associated Information for Special Elements}) to link to the location
in the document where the footnote appeared.
@end deftypefn

If footnotes are in a separate element unit (@pxref{Output Element Units}), the
default footnote special element body formatting function calls
@code{format_footnotes_sequence} (@pxref{Special Element
Body Formatting Functions}).

If the footnotes are not in a separate element unit, or there is no separate element because
there is only one tree unit element or no tree unit element, the
@code{format_footnotes_segment} formatting reference is called when
pending footnotes need to be formatted.  This function reference
can be replaced by a user defined function.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$footnotes_segment} format_footnotes_segment @
                                                        (@var{$converter})
Returns the footnotes formatted.  In the default case, the function reference
calls @code{format_footnotes_sequence} and also sets up a header with
@code{format_heading_text} (@pxref{Basic Formatting Customization}), using the
customization variables @code{FOOTNOTE_END_HEADER_LEVEL} and
the special @code{footnotes} element @code{heading} information
(@pxref{Special Elements Information Customization}).
@end deftypefn


@node Contents and Short Table of Contents Customization
@section Contents and Short Table of Contents Customization

@cindex Customization of tables of contents elements
@cindex Contents, customizing elements
@cindex Short table of contents element, customizing
@cindex Overview element, customizing

@c FIXME this is already documented in the Customization variables
@c documentation in the Texinfo manual.  Keep it anyway as it is
@c slightly more informative here?

To begin with, the table of contents and short table of contents can
be made to appear at different locations in the document.

@vindex CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION
By default, the customization variable
@code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} is set to @samp{after_top}, specifying
that the tables of contents are output at the end of the @code{@@top}
section, to have the main location for navigation in the whole document
early on.  This is in line with @code{FORMAT_MENU} set to @samp{sectiontoc}
with sectioning command being used in HTML for navigation rather
than menus.

If @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} is set to @samp{inline}, the tables of
content are output where the corresponding @@-command, for example
@code{@@contents}, is set.  This behavior is consistent with
@command{texi2dvi}.

If @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} is set to @samp{separate_element},
the tables of contents are output in separate elements, either at
the end of the document if the output is unsplit or in separate files if not.
This makes sense when menus are used for navigation with @code{FORMAT_MENU} set
to @samp{menu}.

If @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} is set to @samp{after_title}
the tables of contents are merged into the title material, which in turn is not
output by default; @pxref{HTML Title Page Customization}.

Next, the following variables allow for some useful control of the
formatting of table of contents and short table of contents:

@vtable @code
@item BEFORE_TOC_LINES
Inserted before the table of contents text.

@item AFTER_TOC_LINES
Inserted after the table of contents text.

@item BEFORE_SHORT_TOC_LINES
Inserted before the short table of contents text.

@item AFTER_SHORT_TOC_LINES
Inserted after the short table of contents text.

@end vtable

Additional customization variables @code{SHORT_TOC_LINK_TO_TOC}
and @code{NUMBER_SECTIONS} can be used to change the formatting
of table of contents.

Finally, the following function reference provides even more control
over the table of contents and short table of contents formatting
reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$toc_result} format_contents @
   (@var{$converter}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element}, @var{$filename})
@var{$command_name} is the @@-command name without leading @@, should be
@samp{contents}, @samp{shortcontents} or @samp{summarycontents}.
@var{\%element} is optional.  It corresponds to the @var{$command_name} Texinfo
tree element, but it is only set if @code{format_contents} is called from a
Texinfo tree element conversion, and not as a special element body formatting.
@var{$filename} is optional and should correspond to the filename where the
formatting happens, for links.

In the default function, structuring information is used
to format the table of contents (@pxref{Conversion General Information}),
and @code{command_contents_href} (@pxref{Other Links@comma{} Headings and
Associated Information for Special Elements}) and @code{command_href}
(@pxref{Target Commands Links@comma{} Texts and Associated Commands})
are used for links.  If @var{$filename} is unset, the current file name
is used, using @code{$converter->get_info('current_filename')}.

Return formatted table of contents or short table of contents.
@end deftypefn

If contents are in a separate element unit (@pxref{Output Element Units}), the
default contents and shortcontents special element body formatting function
calls @code{format_contents} (@pxref{Special Element Body Formatting
Functions}).  Otherwise, @code{format_contents} is called in the conversion
of heading @@-command, in title page formatting, and in @code{@@contents}
conversion function, depending on the @code{CONTENTS_OUTPUT_LOCATION} value.


@node About Element Customization
@section About Element Customization

@cindex Customization of about element
@cindex About element, customizing

The default About element has an explanation of the buttons used in
the document, controlled by @code{SECTION_BUTTONS}.
The formatting of this is influenced by
the @code{text}, @code{description} and @code{example}
direction strings (@pxref{Direction Strings}) and by @code{ACTIVE_ICONS}
(@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}).

@vindex PROGRAM_NAME_IN_ABOUT
@code{PROGRAM_NAME_IN_ABOUT} can also be used to change the beginning of
the About element formatting.

If the above is not enough and you want to control exactly the
formatting of the about element, the @code{about} special element body reference
function may be overridden (@pxref{Special Element Body Formatting Functions}).


@node Special Element Body Formatting Functions
@section Special Element Body Formatting Functions

In addition to the formatting possibilities available with the default
special element formatting presented previously, it is also possible
to control completely how a separate special element is formatted.

To register body formating user defined functions for special element
(@pxref{Output Element Units}), the special elements varieties are used, as
described in @ref{Special Elements Varieties}.
Special element body formatting user defined functions are registered with
@code{texinfo_register_formatting_special_element_body}:

@defun texinfo_register_formatting_special_element_body ($special_element_variety, @
                            \@ampchar{}handler)
@var{$special_element_variety} is the element variety
(@pxref{Special Elements Varieties}).  @var{\&handler} is the user defined
function reference.
@end defun

The call of the user defined functions is:
@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$text} special_element_body (@var{$converter}, @
                                @var{$special_element_variety}, @var{\%element})
@var{$converter} is a converter object. @var{$special_element_variety} is the
element variety.  @var{\%element} is the Texinfo element.

The @var{$text} returned is the formatted special element body.
@end deftypefn

To call a special element body formatting function from user defined code, the
function reference should first be retrieved using
@code{special_element_body_formatting}:

@deftypefun {@var{\&special_element_body_formatting} =} @var{$converter}->special_element_body_formatting @
                                              (@var{$special_element_variety})
@var{$special_element_variety} is the special element variety.  Returns the
conversion function reference for @var{$variety}, or @samp{undef} if there is none,
which should not happen for the special elements described in this manual.
@end deftypefun

For example:
@example
@group
my $footnotes_element_body
 = &@{$converter->special_element_body_formatting('footnotes')@}(
                                   $converter, 'footnotes', $element);
@end group
@end example

It is possible to have access to the default conversion function reference.
The function used is:

@deftypefun {@var{\&default_special_element_body_formatting} =} @
               @var{$converter}->defaults_special_element_body_formatting @
                                               (@var{$special_element_variety})
@var{$special_element_variety} is the special element variety.  Returns the
default conversion function reference for @var{$special_element_variety}, or
@code{undef} if there is none, which should not happen for the special elements
described in this manual.

@node Customizing HTML Footers@comma{} Headers and Navigation Panels
@chapter Customizing HTML Footers, Headers and Navigation Panels

@command{texi2any} provides for customization of the HTML page
headers, footers, and navigation panel.  (These are
unrelated to the headings and ``footings'' produced in @TeX{} output;
@pxref{Headings,, Page Headings, texinfo, Texinfo}.)

In the event that your needs are not met by changing the navigation buttons
(@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}), you can completely control the
formatting of navigation panels by redefining function references.
@xref{Specific formating Functions} for information on how to register
the function references.

In a nutshell, element header and footer formatting function determines
the button directions list to use and calls navigation header formatting.  The
navigation header formatting adds some formatting if needed, but mostly calls
the navigation panel formatting.  The navigation panel can call buttons
formatting.


@node Navigation Panel and Navigation Header Formatting
@section Navigation Panel and Navigation Header Formatting

@c In the unusual case that this isn't enough, it is also possible to
@c redefine the function doing the navigation panel formatting.

@cindex Navigation panel formatting functions
@cindex Formatting functions, for navigation panel

All the formatting functions take a converter object as first argument.

The overall display of navigation panels is controlled via this
function reference, @code{format_navigation_header}:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$navigation_text} format_navigation_header @
   (@var{$converter}, @var{\@@buttons}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element})
@var{\@@buttons} is an array reference holding the specification of
the buttons for the navigation panel
(@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}). @var{\%element} is the
element in which the navigation header is formatted. @var{$command_name} is
the associated command (sectioning command or @code{@@node}).  It may be @code{undef}
for special elements.

Returns the formatted navigation header and panel. The navigation
panel itself can be formatted with a
call to @code{&@{$self->formatting_function('format_navigation_panel')@}}.

The customization variable @code{VERTICAL_HEAD_NAVIGATION} should be relevant.
@end deftypefn

The navigation panel display is controlled via @code{format_navigation_panel}:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$navigation_text} format_navigation_panel @
  (@var{$converter}, @var{\@@buttons}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element}, @var{$vertical})
@var{\@@buttons} is an array reference holding the specification of the buttons
for that navigation panel.   @var{\%element} is the element in which the
navigation header is formatted. @var{$command_name} is the associated command
(sectioning command or @code{@@node}).  It may be @code{undef} for special
elements.  @var{$vertical} is true if the navigation panel should be vertical.

Returns the formatted navigation panel in @var{$navigation_text}. The buttons
in the navigation panel can be formatted with a call to
@code{&@{$self->formatting_function('format_button')@}}.
@end deftypefn

The function reference @code{format_button} does the formatting of
one button:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$formatted_button} format_button @
           (@var{$converter}, @var{$button}, @var{$source_command})
@var{$button} holds the specification of the button (@pxref{Buttons Display}).
@var{$source_command} is an optional argument, the @@-command the link comes from.

Returns the formatted result in @var{$formatted_button}.

The buttons images can be formatted with @code{format_button_icon_img}
(@pxref{Basic Formatting Customization}).

Customization information described in @ref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}
such as @code{BUTTONS_TEXT}, @code{BUTTONS_NAME}, @code{BUTTONS_GOTO},
@code{USE_ACCESSKEY},
@code{USE_REL_REV} and @code{BUTTONS_REL} can be relevant for the
formatting of a button.

All the formatting functions take a converter object as first argument.

By default, the function associated with @code{format_element_header}
formats the header and navigation panel of a tree unit element.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$formatted_header} format_element_header @
    (@var{$converter}, @var{$command_name}, @var{\%element}, @var{\%tree_unit_element})
@var{\%element} is the element in which the navigation header is formatted
(sectioning command, @code{@@node} or special element). @var{$command_name} is
the associated command name.  It may be @code{undef} for special elements.
@var{\%tree_unit_element} is the associated tree unit element (@pxref{Texinfo

Returns the formatted navigation header and panel.

In the default code, the function reference select a buttons list
(@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}).  The navigation header can
then be formatted with a call to
@code{&@{$self->formatting_function('format_navigation_header')@}}.  It is also
possible to format directly the navigation panel, depending on customization
variables values and location in file.
@end deftypefn

Similarly, the function associated with @code{format_element_footer}
formats the footer and navigation panel of a tree unit element.

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$formatted_footer} format_element_footer @
   (@var{$converter}, @var{$tree_unit_type}, @var{\%tree_unit_element}, @
    @var{$content}, @var{$command})
@var{\%tree_unit_element} is the tree unit element element in which the
navigation footer is formatted.  @var{$tree_unit_type} is the associated type.
@var{$content} is the formatted element content.  @var{$command} is an optional
argument, the @@-command associated with the @var{\%tree_unit_element}.

Returns the formatted navigation footer and panel.

In the default code, the function reference select a buttons list
(@pxref{Simple Navigation Panel Customization}).
The navigation header can then be formatted with a call
to @code{&@{$self->formatting_function('format_navigation_header')@}}.

Many customization variables may be interesting for the footer
formatting, such as @code{SPLIT}, @code{HEADERS}, @code{DEFAULT_RULE},

@code{@@node} and sectioning elements are formatted like any other elements
associated with @@-commands.  The corresponding function references can
therefore be replaced by user defined functions for a precise control of
conversion (@xref{Command Tree Element Conversion Functions}).

Tree unit elements default conversion involves calling the formatting reference
@code{format_element_footer} (@pxref{Element Header and Footer Formatting}).
The conversion for these elements with type @code{unit} can be be replaced by

In the default case, the function reference uses @code{CSS_REFS} corresponding
to command-line @option{--css-ref}, @code{html_get_css_elements_classes} and
@code{css_get_info} (@pxref{Simple Customization of CSS}) to determine the CSS
lines.
@end deftypefn


@node Customizing Node Redirection Pages
@section Customizing Node Redirection Pages

Node redirection pages are output if @code{NODE_FILES} is set (@pxref{Invoking
@command{texi2any},,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

It is possible to change completely how node redirection pages
are generated by redefining the following function reference:

@deftypefn {Function Reference} @var{$node_redirection_file_content} @
   format_node_redirection_page (@var{$converter}, @var{\%element})
@var{\%element} is a node element needing a redirection page.  A redirection
page is needed if the node file name is not the file name expected for
HTML cross manual references (@pxref{HTML Xref,,, texinfo, Texinfo}).

Returns the content of the node redirection file.
@end deftypefn

@c NOTE format_frame_files is not documented, we do not want users to use/set this
@c we want frames to disappear

@item @code{@@today}
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Utils $tree = expand_today($converter),,
Texinfo::Convert::Utils::expand_today, texi2any_internals}.

@item @code{@@verbatiminclude}
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Utils $tree = expand_verbatiminclude($registrar@comma{} $configuration_information@comma{} $verbatiminclude),,
Texinfo::Convert::Utils::expand_verbatiminclude, texi2any_internals}.

@item @code{@@def*} @@-commands
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Utils $arguments = definition_arguments_content($element),,
Texinfo::Convert::Utils::definition_arguments_content, texi2any_internals}.
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Utils $tree = definition_category_tree($converter@comma{} $def_line),,
Texinfo::Convert::Utils::definition_category_tree, texi2any_internals}.

@item @code{@@float}
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter ($caption@comma{} $prepended) = $converter->float_name_caption ($float),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::float_name_caption, texi2any_internals}.
Can be called as @code{$converter->float_name_caption}.

@item accent @@-commands
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $result = xml_accent($text@comma{} $accent_command@comma{} $in_upper_case@comma{} $use_numeric_entities),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::xml_accent, texi2any_internals}.
Can be called as @code{$converter->xml_accent}.

@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $result = xml_numeric_entity_accent($accent_command_name@comma{} $text),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::xml_numeric_entity_accent, texi2any_internals}.

@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $result = $converter->convert_accents($accent_command@comma{} \&format_accents@comma{} $in_upper_case),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::convert_accents, texi2any_internals}.

@item text element
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $formatted_text = $converter->xml_format_text_with_numeric_entities($text),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::xml_format_text_with_numeric_entities,
texi2any_internals}. Can be called as
@code{$converter->xml_format_text_with_numeric_entities}.

@item @code{@@item} in @code{@@table} and similar @@-commands
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $table_item_tree = $converter->table_item_content_tree($element@comma{} $contents),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::table_item_content_tree, texi2any_internals}.
Can be called as @code{$converter->table_item_content_tree}.

@item @code{@@*index} @code{@@subentry}
@xref{Texinfo::Convert::Converter $contents_array $converter->comma_index_subentries_tree($entry),,
Texinfo::Convert::Converter::comma_index_subentries_tree, texi2any_internals}.
Can be called as @code{$converter->comma_index_subentries_tree}.

@item global informative commands (@code{@@contents}, @code{@@footnotestyle} @enddots{})
@xref{Texinfo::Common set_informative_command_value($configuration_information@comma{} $element),,
Texinfo::Common::set_informative_command_value, texi2any_internals}.

@item heading commands, such as @code{@@subheading}
@xref{Texinfo::Common $level = section_level($section),,
Texinfo::Common::section_level, texi2any_internals}.  This function would work
for sectioning commands too, but for sectioning commands,
@code{section->@{'structure'@}->@{'section_level'@}} can also be used.
@xref{Texinfo Tree Elements in User Defined Functions}.

@item sectioning commands
@xref{Texinfo::Structuring $command_name = section_level_adjusted_command_name($element),,
Texinfo::Structuring::section_level_adjusted_command_name, texi2any_internals}.

@item @code{@@itemize}
@code{@@itemize} normally have an @@-command as argument.  If, instead,
the argument is some Texinfo code, @code{html_convert_css_string_for_list_mark}
can be used to convert that argument to text usable in CSS style specifications.

@deftypefun {@var{$text_for_css} =} @var{$converter}->html_convert_css_string_for_list_mark @
             (@var{\%element}, @var{$explanation})
@var{\%element} is the Texinfo element that is converted to CSS text.
In general, it is @code{$itemize->@{'args'@}->[0]}, with @code{$itemize} an @code{@@itemize}
Texinfo tree element.  @var{$explanation} is an optional string describing what is
being done that can be useful for debugging.

Returns @var{\%element} formatted as text suitable for CSS.
@end deftypefun
@end table

The @code{Texinfo::Convert::NodeNameNormalization} converter, used
for normalization of labels, exports functions that can be used on Texinfo
elements trees to obtain strings that are unique and can be used in attributes.
