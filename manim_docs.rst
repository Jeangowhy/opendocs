Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for
creating explanatory math videos.

Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a
personal project by the author of
`3Blue1Brown <https://www.3blue1brown.com/>`__ for the purpose of
animating those videos, with video-specific code available
`here <https://github.com/3b1b/videos>`__. In 2020 a group of developers
forked it into what is now the 
`community edition <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/>`__, with a goal of
being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community
contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. 
See `this page <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions>`__
for more details.

Installation
------------

   **WARNING:** These instructions are for ManimGL *only*. Trying to use
   these instructions to install
   `ManimCommunity/manim <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim>`__ or
   instructions there to install this version will cause problems. You
   should first decide which version you wish to install, then only
   follow the instructions for your desired version.

   **Note**: To install manim directly through pip, please pay attention
   to the name of the installed package. This repository is ManimGL of
   3b1b. The package name is ``manimgl`` instead of ``manim`` or
   ``manimlib``. Please use ``pip install manimgl`` to install the
   version in this repository.

Manim runs on Python 3.7 or higher.

System requirements are `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__,
`OpenGL <https://www.opengl.org/>`__ and
`LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org>`__ (optional, if you want to use
LaTeX). For Linux, `Pango <https://pango.gnome.org>`__ along with its
development headers are required. See instruction
`here <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/ManimPango#building>`__.

Directly
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: sh

   # Install manimgl
   pip install manimgl

   # Try it out
   manimgl

For more options, take a look at the `Using manim <#using-manim>`__
sections further below.

If you want to hack on manimlib itself, clone this repository and in
that directory execute:

.. code:: sh

   # Install manimgl
   pip install -e .

   # Try it out
   manimgl example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample
   # or
   manim-render example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample

Directly (Windows)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `Install
   FFmpeg <https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows>`__.
2. Install a LaTeX distribution.
   `MiKTeX <https://miktex.org/download>`__ is recommended.
3. Install the remaining Python packages.
   ``sh     git clone https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git     cd manim     pip install -e .     manimgl example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample``

Mac OSX
~~~~~~~

1. Install FFmpeg, LaTeX in terminal using homebrew.
   ``sh     brew install ffmpeg mactex``

2. Install latest version of manim using these command.
   ``sh     git clone https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git     cd manim     pip install -e .     manimgl example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample``

Anaconda Install
----------------

1. Install LaTeX as above.
2. Create a conda environment using
   ``conda create -n manim python=3.8``.
3. Activate the environment using ``conda activate manim``.
4. Install manimgl using ``pip install -e .``.

Using manim
-----------

Try running the following: 

.. code:: sh

   manimgl example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample

This should pop up a window playing a simple scene.

Some useful flags include: \* ``-w`` to write the scene to a file \*
``-o`` to write the scene to a file and open the result \* ``-s`` to
skip to the end and just show the final frame. \* ``-so`` will save the
final frame to an image and show it \* ``-n <number>`` to skip ahead to
the ``n``\ ‚Äôth animation of a scene. \* ``-f`` to make the playback
window fullscreen

Take a look at custom_config.yml for further configuration. To add your
customization, you can either edit this file, or add another file by the
same name ‚Äúcustom_config.yml‚Äù to whatever directory you are running
manim from. For example `this is the
one <https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/custom_config.yml>`__
for 3blue1brown videos. There you can specify where videos should be
output to, where manim should look for image files and sounds you want
to read in, and other defaults regarding style and video quality.

Look through the 
`example scenes <https://3b1b.github.io/manim/getting_started/example_scenes.html>`__
to get a sense of how it is used, and feel free to look through the code
behind `3blue1brown videos <https://github.com/3b1b/videos>`__ for a
much larger set of example. Note, however, that developments are often
made to the library without considering backwards compatibility with
those old videos. To run an old project with a guarantee that it will
work, you will have to go back to the commit which completed that
project.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation is in progress at 
`3b1b.github.io/manim <https://3b1b.github.io/manim/>`__. And there is
also a Chinese version maintained by
`@manim-kindergarten <https://manim.org.cn>`__:
`docs.manim.org.cn <https://docs.manim.org.cn/>`__ (in Chinese).

`manim-kindergarten <https://github.com/manim-kindergarten/>`__ wrote
and collected some useful extra classes and some codes of videos in
`manim_sandbox repo <https://github.com/manim-kindergarten/manim_sandbox>`__.

Contributing
------------

Is always welcome. As mentioned above, the 
`community edition <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim>`__ has the most active
ecosystem for contributions, with testing and continuous integration,
but pull requests are welcome here too. Please explain the motivation
for a given change and examples of its effect.

===================================================
/. üöÄ docs/source/getting_started/quickstart.rst
===================================================

Quick Start
===========

After installing the manim environment according to the instructions on the
:doc:`installation` page, you can try to make a scene yourself from scratch.

First, create a new ``.py`` file (such as ``start.py``) according to the following
directory structure:

.. code-block:: text
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    manim/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manimlib/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ animation/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default_config.yml
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ window.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_config.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ start.py

And paste the following code (I will explain the function of each line in detail later):

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from manimlib import *

    class SquareToCircle(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            circle = Circle()
            circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
            circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)

            self.add(circle)

And run this command:

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl start.py SquareToCircle

A window will pop up on the screen. And then you can :

- scroll the middle mouse button to move the screen up and down
- hold down the :kbd:`z` on the keyboard while scrolling the middle mouse button to zoom the screen
- hold down the :kbd:`s` key on the keyboard and move the mouse to pan the screen
- hold down the :kbd:`d` key on the keyboard and move the mouse to change the three-dimensional perspective.

Finally, you can close the window and exit the program by pressing :kbd:`q`.

Run this command again:

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl start.py SquareToCircle -os

At this time, no window will pop up. When the program is finished, this rendered
image will be automatically opened (saved in the subdirectory ``images/`` of the same
level directory of ``start.py`` by default):

.. image:: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/quickstart/SquareToCircle.png
    :align: center

Make an image
-------------

Next, let's take a detailed look at what each row does.

**Line 1**:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from manimlib import *
    
This will import all the classes that may be used when using manim.

**Line 3**:

.. code-block:: python

    class SquareToCircle(Scene):

Create a :class:`Scene` subclass ``SquareToCircle``, which will be
the scene you write and render.

**Line 4**:

.. code-block:: python

    def construct(self):

Write the ``construct()`` method, the content of which will determine
how to create the mobjects in the screen and what operations need to be performed.

**Line 5**:

.. code-block:: python

    circle = Circle()

Create a circle (an instance of the :class:`Circle` class), called ``circle``

**Line 6~7**:

.. code-block:: python

    circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
    circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)

Set the circle style by calling the circle's method.

- The ``.set_fill()`` method sets the fill color of this circle to blue (``BLUE``, defined in :doc:`../documentation/constants`), and the fill transparency to 0.5.
- The ``.set_stroke()`` method sets the stroke color of this circle to dark blue (``BLUE_E``, defined in :doc:`../documentation/constants`), and the stroke width to 4.

**Line 9**:

.. code-block:: python

    self.add(circle)

Add this circle to the screen through the ``.add()`` method of :class:`Scene`.

Add animations
--------------

Let's change some codes and add some animations to make videos instead of just pictures.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from manimlib import *

    class SquareToCircle(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            circle = Circle()
            circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
            circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)
            square = Square()

            self.play(ShowCreation(square))
            self.wait()
            self.play(ReplacementTransform(square, circle))
            self.wait()

Run this command this time:

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl start.py SquareToCircle

The pop-up window will play animations of drawing a square and transforming
it into a circle. If you want to save this video, run:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    manimgl start.py SquareToCircle -o

This time there will be no pop-up window, but the video file (saved in the subdirectory
``videos/`` of the same level directory of ``start.py`` by default) will be automatically
opened after the operation is over:

.. raw:: html

    <video class="manim-video" controls loop autoplay src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/quickstart/SquareToCircle.mp4"></video>

Let's take a look at the code this time. The first 7 lines are the same as the previous
ones, and the 8th line is similar to the 5th line, which creates an instance of the
:class:`Square` class and named it ``square``.

**Line 10**:

.. code-block:: python

    self.play(ShowCreation(square))

An animation is played through :class:`Scene`'s ``.play()`` method. :class:`ShowCreation`
is an animation that shows the process of creating a given mobject.
``self.play(ShowCreation(square))`` is to play the animation of creating ``square``.

**Line 11**:

.. code-block:: python

    self.wait()

Use :class:`Scene`'s ``.wait()`` method to pause (default 1s), you can pass in
parameters to indicate the pause time (for example, ``self.wait(3)`` means pause for 3s).

**Line 12**:

.. code-block:: python

    self.play(ReplacementTransform(square, circle))

Play the animation that transforms ``square`` into ``circle``.
``ReplacementTransform(A, B)`` means to transform A into B's pattern and replace A with B.

**Line 13**: Same as line 11, pause for 1s.


Enable interaction
------------------

Interaction is a new feature of the new version. You can add the following line
at the end of the code to enable interaction:

.. code-block:: python

    self.embed()

Then run ``manimgl start.py SquareToCircle``. 

After the previous animation is executed, the ipython terminal will be opened on
the command line. After that, you can continue to write code in it, and the statement
you entered will be executed immediately after pressing :kbd:`Enter`.

For example: input the following lines (without comment lines) into it respectively
(``self.play`` can be abbreviated as ``play`` in this mode):

.. code-block:: python

    # Stretched 4 times in the vertical direction
    play(circle.animate.stretch(4, dim=0))
    # Rotate the ellipse 90¬∞
    play(Rotate(circle, TAU / 4))
    # Move 2 units to the right and shrink to 1/4 of the original
    play(circle.animate.shift(2 * RIGHT), circle.animate.scale(0.25))
    # Insert 10 curves into circle for non-linear transformation (no animation will play)
    circle.insert_n_curves(10)
    # Apply a complex transformation of f(z)=z^2 to all points on the circle
    play(circle.animate.apply_complex_function(lambda z: z**2))
    # Close the window and exit the program
    exit()

You will get an animation similar to the following:

.. raw:: html

    <video class="manim-video" controls loop autoplay src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/quickstart/SquareToCircleEmbed.mp4"></video>

If you want to enter the interactive mode directly, you don't have to write an
empty scene containing only ``self.embed()``, you can directly run the following command
(this will enter the ipython terminal while the window pops up):

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl

You succeeded!
--------------

After reading the above content, you already know how to use manim.
Below you can see some examples, in the :doc:`example_scenes` page.
But before that, you'd better have a look at the :doc:`configuration` of manim.

To run manim, you need to enter the directory at the same level as ``manimlib/`` 
and enter the command in the following format into terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl <code>.py <Scene> <flags>
    # or
    manim-render <code>.py <Scene> <flags>

- ``<code>.py`` : The python file you wrote. Needs to be at the same level as ``manimlib/``, otherwise you need to use an absolute path or a relative path.
- ``<Scene>`` : The scene you want to render here. If it is not written or written incorrectly, it will list all for you to choose. And if there is only one ``Scene`` in the file, this class will be rendered directly.
- ``<flags>`` : CLI flags.

Some useful flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``-w`` to write the scene to a file.
- ``-o`` to write the scene to a file and open the result.
- ``-s`` to skip to the end and just show the final frame. 

  - ``-so`` will save the final frame to an image and show it.

- ``-n <number>`` to skip ahead to the ``n``\ ‚Äôth animation of a scene. 
- ``-f`` to make the playback window fullscreen.

All supported flags

custom_config
--------------

In order to perform more configuration (about directories, etc.) and permanently 
change the default value (you don't have to add flags to the command every time), 
you can modify ``custom_config.yml``. The meaning of each option is in 
page :doc:`../documentation/custom_config`.

You can also use different ``custom_config.yml`` for different directories, such as 
following the directory structure:

.. code-block:: text

    manim/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manimlib/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ animation/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default_config.yml
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ window.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_config.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_config.yml

When you enter the ``project/`` folder and run ``manimgl code.py <Scene>``, 
it will overwrite ``manim/default_config.yml`` with ``custom_config.yml`` 
in the ``project`` folder.

Alternatively, you can use ``--config_file`` flag in CLI to specify configuration file manually.

.. code-block:: sh

    manimgl project/code.py --config_file /path/to/custom_config.yml

Example Scenes
==============

After understanding the previous knowledge, we can understand more scenes.
Many example scenes are given in ``example_scenes.py``, let's start with
the simplest and one by one.

InteractiveDevlopment
---------------------

.. manim-example:: InteractiveDevelopment
    :media: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/example_scenes/InteractiveDevelopment.mp4

    from manimlib import *

    class InteractiveDevelopment(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            circle = Circle()
            circle.set_fill(BLUE, opacity=0.5)
            circle.set_stroke(BLUE_E, width=4)
            square = Square()

            self.play(ShowCreation(square))
            self.wait()

            # This opens an iPython terminal where you can keep writing
            # lines as if they were part of this construct method.
            # In particular, 'square', 'circle' and 'self' will all be
            # part of the local namespace in that terminal.
            self.embed()

            # Try copying and pasting some of the lines below into
            # the interactive shell
            self.play(ReplacementTransform(square, circle))
            self.wait()
            self.play(circle.animate.stretch(4, 0))
            self.play(Rotate(circle, 90 * DEGREES))
            self.play(circle.animate.shift(2 * RIGHT).scale(0.25))

            text = Text("""
                In general, using the interactive shell
                is very helpful when developing new scenes
            """)
            self.play(Write(text))

            # In the interactive shell, you can just type
            # play, add, remove, clear, wait, save_state and restore,
            # instead of self.play, self.add, self.remove, etc.

            # To interact with the window, type touch().  You can then
            # scroll in the window, or zoom by holding down 'z' while scrolling,
            # and change camera perspective by holding down 'd' while moving
            # the mouse.  Press 'r' to reset to the standard camera position.
            # Press 'q' to stop interacting with the window and go back to
            # typing new commands into the shell.

            # In principle you can customize a scene to be responsive to
            # mouse and keyboard interactions
            always(circle.move_to, self.mouse_point)

This scene is similar to what we wrote in :doc:`quickstart`.
And how to interact has been written in the comments.
No more explanation here.

AnimatingMethods
----------------

.. manim-example:: AnimatingMethods
    :media: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/example_scenes/AnimatingMethods.mp4

    class AnimatingMethods(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            grid = OldTex(r"\pi").get_grid(10, 10, height=4)
            self.add(grid)

            # You can animate the application of mobject methods with the
            # ".animate" syntax:
            self.play(grid.animate.shift(LEFT))

            # Alternatively, you can use the older syntax by passing the
            # method and then the arguments to the scene's "play" function:
            self.play(grid.shift, LEFT)

            # Both of those will interpolate between the mobject's initial
            # state and whatever happens when you apply that method.
            # For this example, calling grid.shift(LEFT) would shift the
            # grid one unit to the left, but both of the previous calls to
            # "self.play" animate that motion.

            # The same applies for any method, including those setting colors.
            self.play(grid.animate.set_color(YELLOW))
            self.wait()
            self.play(grid.animate.set_submobject_colors_by_gradient(BLUE, GREEN))
            self.wait()
            self.play(grid.animate.set_height(TAU - MED_SMALL_BUFF))
            self.wait()

            # The method Mobject.apply_complex_function lets you apply arbitrary
            # complex functions, treating the points defining the mobject as
            # complex numbers.
            self.play(grid.animate.apply_complex_function(np.exp), run_time=5)
            self.wait()

            # Even more generally, you could apply Mobject.apply_function,
            # which takes in functions form R^3 to R^3
            self.play(
                grid.animate.apply_function(
                    lambda p: [
                        p[0] + 0.5 * math.sin(p[1]),
                        p[1] + 0.5 * math.sin(p[0]),
                        p[2]
                    ]
                ),
                run_time=5,
            )
            self.wait()

The new usage in this scene is ``.get_grid()`` and ``self.play(mob.animate.method(args))``.

- ``.get_grid()`` method will return a new mobject containing multiple copies of this one arranged in a grid.
- ``self.play(mob.animate.method(args))`` animates the method, and the details are in the comments above.

TextExample
-----------

.. manim-example:: TextExample
    :media: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/manim-kindergarten/CDN@master/manimgl_assets/example_scenes/TextExample.mp4

    class TextExample(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            # To run this scene properly, you should have "Consolas" font in your computer
            # for full usage, you can see https://github.com/3b1b/manim/pull/680
            text = Text("Here is a text", font="Consolas", font_size=90)
            difference = Text(
                """
                The most important difference between Text and TexText is that\n
                you can change the font more easily, but can't use the LaTeX grammar
                """,
                font="Arial", font_size=24,
                # t2c is a dict that you can choose color for different text
                t2c={"Text": BLUE, "TexText": BLUE, "LaTeX": ORANGE}
            )
            VGroup(text, difference).arrange(DOWN, buff=1)
            self.play(Write(text))
            self.play(FadeIn(difference, UP))
            self.wait(3)

            fonts = Text(
                "And you can also set the font according to different words",
                font="Arial",
                t2f={"font": "Consolas", "words": "Consolas"},
                t2c={"font": BLUE, "words": GREEN}
            )
            fonts.set_width(FRAME_WIDTH - 1)
            slant = Text(
                "And the same as slant and weight",
                font="Consolas",
                t2s={"slant": ITALIC},
                t2w={"weight": BOLD},
                t2c={"slant": ORANGE, "weight": RED}
            )
            VGroup(fonts, slant).arrange(DOWN, buff=0.8)
            self.play(FadeOut(text), FadeOut(difference, shift=DOWN))
            self.play(Write(fonts))
            self.wait()
            self.play(Write(slant))
            self.wait()

The new classes in this scene are ``Text``, ``VGroup``, ``Write``, ``FadeIn`` and ``FadeOut``.

- ``Text`` can create text, define fonts, etc. The usage ais clearly reflected in the above examples.
- ``VGroup`` can put multiple ``VMobject`` together as a whole. In the example, the ``.arrange()`` method is called to arrange the sub-mobjects in sequence downward (``DOWN``), and the spacing is ``buff``.
- ``Write`` is an animation that shows similar writing effects.
- ``FadeIn`` fades the object in, the second parameter indicates the direction of the fade in.
- ``FadeOut`` fades out the object, the second parameter indicates the direction of the fade out.

                # hierarchy of the resulting mobject ensure that the
                # Tex mobject has a subject corresponding to
                # each of these strings.  For example, the Tex mobject

The new classes in this scene are ``Tex``, ``TexText``, ``TransformMatchingTex``
and ``TransformMatchingShapes``.

- ``Tex`` uses LaTeX to create mathematical formulas.
- ``TexText`` uses LaTeX to create text.
- ``TransformMatchingTeX`` automatically transforms sub-objects according to the similarities and differences of tex in ``Tex``.
- ``TransformMatchingShapes`` automatically transform sub-objects directly based on the similarities and differences of the object point sets.

The new classes and usage in this scene are ``always_redraw()``, ``DecimalNumber``, ``.to_edge()``,
``.center()``, ``always()``, ``f_always()``, ``.set_y()`` and ``.add_updater()``.

- ``always_redraw()`` function create a new mobject every frame.
- ``DecimalNumber`` is a variable number, speed it up by breaking it into ``Text`` characters.
- ``.to_edge()`` means to place the object on the edge of the screen.
- ``.center()`` means to place the object in the center of the screen.
- ``always(f, x)`` means that a certain function (``f(x)``) is executed every frame.
- ``f_always(f, g)`` is similar to ``always``, executed ``f(g())`` every frame.
- ``.set_y()`` means to set the ordinate of the object on the screen.
- ``.add_updater()`` sets an update function for the object. For example: ``mob1.add_updater(lambda mob: mob.next_to(mob2))`` means ``mob1.next_to(mob2)`` is executed every frame.

This scene shows an example of using a three-dimensional surface, and
the related usage has been briefly described in the notes.

- ``.fix_in_frame()`` makes the object not change with the view angle of the screen, and is always displayed at a fixed position on the screen.

This scene is a comprehensive application of a two-dimensional scene.

After seeing these scenes, you have already understood part of the
usage of manim. For more examples, see `the video code of 3b1b <https://github.com/3b1b/videos>`_.

What's new
==========

Usage changes of new version manim
----------------------------------

There are many changes in the new version of manim, and here are only the changes that 
may have an impact at the code writing level. 

Some of the changes here may not have any major impact on the use, and some changes 
that affect the use are not mentioned below.

This document is for reference only, see the source code for details.

- ``Animation``
  
  - Added ``Fade`` as the parent class of ``FadeIn`` and ``FadeOut``
  - ``FadeIn`` and ``FadeOut`` can be passed in ``shift`` and ``scale`` parameters
  - Deleted ``FadeInFrom, FadeInFromDown, FadeOutAndShift, FadeOutAndShiftDown, FadeInFromLarge``, these can be used ``FadeIn, FadeOut`` to achieve the same effect more easily
  - Added ``FadeTransform`` to cross fade between two objects, and subclass ``FadeTransformPieces``
  - Added ``CountInFrom(decimal_mob, source_number=0)`` to count ``decimal_mob`` from ``source_number`` to the current value
  - ``Rotating`` can directly pass in ``angle`` and ``axis`` without writing keywords ``angle=, axis=``
  - ``Rotate`` has become a subclass of ``Rotating``, and the distortion effect in ``Transform`` will not appear
  - Removed ``MoveCar`` animation
  - Added ``TransformMatchingShapes(mobject, target_mobject)`` and ``TransformMatchingTex(mobject, target_mobject)``
  
- ``Camera``

  - Removed all camera classes except ``Camera`` (``MappingCamera``, ``MovingCamera``, ``MultiCamera``) and all functions in ``ThreeDCamera``
  - Implemented ``CameraFrame`` (as a ``Mobject``)
  
    - Can be called by ``self.camera.frame`` in ``Scene``
    - All methods of ``Mobject`` can be used, such as ``.shift()``, ``.scale()``, etc.
    - Call ``.to_default_state()`` to place in the default position
    - Set the Euler angles of the camera by ``.set_euler_angles(theta, phi, gamma)``
    - Set three single Euler angles by ``.set_theta(theta)``, ``.set_phi(phi)``, ``.set_gamma(gamma)``
    - Use ``.increment_theta(dtheta)``, ``.increment_phi(dphi)``, ``.increment_gamma(gamma)`` to increase the three Euler angles by a certain value. Can be used to realize automatic rotation ``self.camera.frame.add_updater(lambda mob, dt: mob.increment_theta(0.1 * dt))``
  
  - ``Camera`` adds a light source, which is a ``Point``, which can be called by ``self.camera.light_source`` in ``Scene`` to move and so on. The default position is ``(- 10, 10, 10)``
  
- Delete ``Container``
- ``Mobject``
  
  - ``svg`` related
  
    - Added ``Checkmark`` and ``Exmark``
    - Some unnecessary classes have been removed from ``drawings.py``
    - Removed ``Code`` and ``Paragraph`` (by mistake)
    - ``TexMobject`` is renamed to ``Tex``, ``TextMobject`` is renamed to ``TexText``
    - ``font_size`` has been added to ``Tex``, ``TexText`` and ``Text``
    - ``Tex`` and ``TexText`` added ``isolate``, which is a list, which will be automatically split
  
  - Mobject ``types``
  
    - Added a new class ``Surface``, which is the parent class of ``ParametricSurface`` and ``TexturedSurface``.
    - Added the group ``SGroup`` for ``Surface``
    - Added ``TexturedSurface(uv_surface, image_file, dark_image_file=None)``, where ``uv_surface`` is a ``Surface``, ``image_file`` is the image to be posted, and ``dark_image_file`` is the image to be posted in the dark (default and ``image_file`` is the same)
    - Deleted ``Mobject1D``, ``Mobject2D``, ``PointCloudDot``
    - Added ``DotCloud`` (a ``PMobject``), which has been greatly optimized
    - Removed ``AbstractImageMobject``, ``ImageMobjectFromCamera``
    - Removed ``sheen`` from ``VMobject``
  
  - ``Mobject``
  
    - Added ``gloss`` and ``shadow``, which are the numbers between ``[0, 1]`` respectively. There are four methods of ``.get_gloss()``, ``.set_gloss(gloss)``, ``.get_shadow()``, ``.set_shadow(shadow)``
    - Added ``.get_grid(n_rows, n_cols)`` to copy into grid
    - Added ``.set_color_by_code(glsl_code)`` to use GLSL code to change the color
    - Added ``.set_color_by_xyz_func(glsl_snippet, min_value=-5.0, max_value=5.0, colormap="viridis")`` to pass in GLSL expression in the form of ``x,y,z``, the return value should be a floating point number
  
  - Coordinate system (including ``Axes``, ``ThreeDAxes``, ``NumberPlane``, ``ComplexPlane``)

    - No longer use ``x_min``, ``x_max``, ``y_min``, ``y_max``, but use ``x_range``, ``y_range`` as a ``np.array()``, containing three numbers ``np.array([ Minimum, maximum, step size])``
    - Added the abbreviation ``.i2gp(x, graph)`` of ``.input_to_graph_point(x, graph)``
    - Added some functions of the original ``GraphScene``
  
      - Added ``.get_v_line(point)``, ``.get_h_line(point)`` to return the line from ``point`` to the two coordinate axes, and specify the line type through the keyword argument of ``line_func`` (default ``DashedLine``)
      - Added ``.get_graph_label(graph, label, x, direction, buff, color)`` to return the label added to the image
      - Added ``.get_v_line_to_graph(x, graph)``, ``.get_h_line_to_graph(x, graph)`` to return the line from the point with the abscissa of ``x`` on the ``graph`` to the two- axis line
      - Added ``.angle_of_tangent(x, graph, dx=EPSILON)``, returns the inclination angle of ``graph`` at ``x``
      - Added ``.slope_of_tangent(x, graph, dx=EPSILON)``, returns the slope of tangent line of ``graph`` at ``x``
      - Added ``.get_tangent_line(x, graph, length=5)`` to return the tangent line of ``graph`` at ``x``
      - Added ``.get_riemann_rectangles(graph, x_range, dx, input_sample_type, ...)`` to return Riemann rectangles (a ``VGroup``)
  
    - The attribute ``number_line_config`` of ``Axes`` is renamed to ``axis_config``
    - ``Axes`` original ``.get_coordinate_labels(x_values, y_values)`` method was renamed to ``.add_coordinate_labels(x_values, y_values)`` (but it is not added to the screen)
    - ``.add_coordinate_labels(numbers)`` of ``ComplexPlane`` will directly add the coordinates to the screen
  
  - ``NumberLine``
  
    - No longer use ``x_min``, ``x_max``, ``tick_frequency``, but use ``x_range``, which is an array containing three numbers ``[min, max, step]``
    - The original ``label_direction`` attribute changed to the ``line_to_number_direction`` attribute
    - Replace ``tip_width`` and ``tip_height`` with ``tip_config`` (dictionary) attributes
    - The original ``exclude_zero_from_default`` attribute is modified to the ``numbers_to_exclude`` attribute (default is None)
    - The original ``.add_tick_marks()`` method was changed to the ``.add_ticks()`` method
    - Delete the ``.get_number_mobjects(*numbers)`` method, only use the ``.add_numbers(x_values=None, excluding=None)`` method
  
  - Three-dimensional objects
  
    - Added ``SurfaceMesh(uv_surface)``, pass in a ``Surface`` to generate its uv mesh
    - ``ParametricSurface`` no longer uses ``u_min, u_max, v_min, v_max``, but instead uses ``u_range, v_range``, which is a tuple (``(min, max)``), and ``resolution`` can be set larger, don‚Äôt worry Speed ‚Äã‚Äãissue
    - Added ``Torus``, controlled by ``r1, r2`` keyword parameters
    - Added ``Cylinder``, controlled by ``height, radius`` keyword parameters
    - Added ``Line3D`` (extremely thin cylinder), controlled by the ``width`` keyword parameter
    - Added ``Disk3D``, controlled by ``radius`` keyword parameter
    - Add ``Square3D``, controlled by ``side_length`` keyword parameter
    - Improved ``Cube`` and ``Prism``, the usage remains unchanged
  
  - Other objects
  
    - ``ParametricFunction`` is renamed to ``ParametricCurve``. Instead of using ``t_min, t_max, step_size``, use ``t_range``, which is an array of three numbers (``[t_min, t_max, step_size]``). ``dt`` was renamed to ``epsilon``. Other usage remains unchanged
    - All ``TipableVMobject`` can pass in ``tip_length`` to control the style of ``tip``
    - ``Line`` adds ``.set_points_by_ends(start, end, buff=0, path_arc=0)`` method
    - ``Line`` added ``.get_projection(point)`` to return the projection position of ``point`` on a straight line
    - ``Arrow`` adds three attributes of ``thickness, tip_width_ratio, tip_angle``
    - ``CubicBezier`` is changed to ``a0, h0, h1, a1``, that is, only a third-order Bezier curve is supported
    - ``Square`` can be initialized directly by passing in ``side_length`` instead of using the keyword ``side_length=``
    - ``always_redraw(func, *args, **kwargs)`` supports incoming parameters ``*args, **kwargs``
    - The ``digit_to_digit_buff`` property of ``DecimalNumber`` has been renamed to ``digit_buff_per_font_unit``, and the ``.scale()`` method has been improved
    - ``ValueTracker`` adds ``value_type`` attribute, the default is ``np.float64``
  
- ``Scene``
  
  - Removed all functions of ``GraphScene`` (moved to ``once_useful_constructs``), ``MovingCameraScene``, ``ReconfigurableScene``, ``SceneFromVideo``, ``ZoomedScene``, and ``ThreeDScene``. Because these can basically be achieved by adjusting ``CameraFrame`` (``self.camera.frame``)
  - Currently ``SampleSpaceScene`` and ``VectorScene`` have not been changed for the new version, so it is not recommended to use (only ``Scene`` is recommended)
  - Fix the export of gif, just use the ``-i`` option directly
  - Added the ``.interact()`` method, during which the mouse and keyboard can be used to continue the interaction, which will be executed by default after the scene ends
  - Added ``.embed()`` method, open iPython terminal to enter interactive mode
  - Added ``.save_state()`` method to save the current state of the scene
  - Added ``.restore()`` method to restore the entire scene to the saved state
  
- ``utils``
  
  - A series of functions related to second-order Bezier have been added to ``utils/bezier.py``
  - Added a function to read color map from ``matplotlib`` in ``utils/color.py``
  - Added a series of related functions for processing folders/custom styles/object families
  - ``resize_array``, ``resize_preserving_order``, ``resize_with_interpolation`` three functions have been added to ``utils/iterables.py``
  - The definition of ``smooth`` is updated in ``utils/rate_functions.py``
  - ``clip(a, min_a, max_a)`` function has been added to ``utils/simple_functions.py``
  - Some functions have been improved in ``utils/space_ops.py``, some functions for space calculation, and functions for processing triangulation have been added
  
- ``constants``
  
  - Fixed the aspect ratio of the screen to 16:9
  - Deleted the old gray series (``LIGHT_GREY``, ``GREY``, ``DARK_GREY``, ``DARKER_GREY``), added a new series of gray ``GREY_A`` ~ ``GREY_E``

``directories``
---------------

- ``mirror_module_path``
    (``True`` or ``False``) Whether to create a folder named the name of the 
    running file under the ``output`` path, and save the output (``images/`` 
    or ``videos/``) in it.

- ``output``
    Output file path, the videos will be saved in the ``videos/`` folder under it, 
    and the pictures will be saved in the ``images/`` folder under it.

    For example, if you set ``output`` to ``"/.../manim/output"`` and 
    ``mirror_module_path`` to ``False``, then you exported ``Scene1`` in the code 
    file and saved the last frame, then the final directory structure will be like:

    .. code-block:: text
        :emphasize-lines: 9, 11

            manim/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manimlib/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ animation/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default_config.yml
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ window.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
            ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scene1.png
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ videos
            ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scene1.mp4
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.py
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_config.yml

    But if you set ``mirror_module_path`` to ``True``, the directory structure will be:

    .. code-block:: text
        :emphasize-lines: 8

            manim/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manimlib/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ animation/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default_config.yml
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ window.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code/
            ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
            ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scene1.png
            ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ videos
            ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Scene1.mp4
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.py
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_config.yml

- ``raster_images`` 
    The directory for storing raster images to be used in the code (including 
    ``.jpg``, ``.jpeg``, ``.png`` and ``.gif``), which will be read by ``ImageMobject``.

- ``vector_images``
    The directory for storing vector images to be used in the code (including 
    ``.svg`` and ``.xdv``), which will be read by ``SVGMobject``.

- ``sounds``
    The directory for storing sound files to be used in ``Scene.add_sound()`` (
    including ``.wav`` and ``.mp3``).

- ``temporary_storage``
    The directory for storing temporarily generated cache files, including 
    ``Tex`` cache, ``Text`` cache and storage of object points.

``tex``
-------

- ``executable``
    The executable program used to compile LaTeX (``latex`` or ``xelatex -no-pdf``
    is recommended)

- ``template_file``
    LaTeX template used, in ``manimlib/tex_templates``

- ``intermediate_filetype``
    The type of intermediate vector file generated after compilation (``dvi`` if 
    ``latex`` is used, ``xdv`` if ``xelatex`` is used)
    
- ``text_to_replace``
    The text to be replaced in the template (needn't to change)

``universal_import_line``
-------------------------

Import line that need to execute when entering interactive mode directly.

``style``
---------

- ``font`` 
    Default font of Text

- ``text_alignment``
    Default text alignment for LaTeX

- ``background_color``
    Default background color

``window_position``
-------------------

The relative position of the playback window on the display (two characters, 
the first character means upper(U) / middle(O) / lower(D), the second character 
means left(L) / middle(O) / right(R)).

``window_monitor``
------------------

The number of the monitor you want the preview window to pop up on. (default is 0)

``full_screen``
---------------

Whether open the window in full screen. (default is false)

``break_into_partial_movies``
-----------------------------

If this is set to ``True``, then many small files will be written corresponding 
to each ``Scene.play`` and ``Scene.wait`` call, and these files will then be combined
to form the full scene.  

Sometimes video-editing is made easier when working with the broken up scene, which
effectively has cuts at all the places you might want.

``camera_resolutions``
----------------------

Export resolutions

- ``low``
    Low resolutions (default is 480p)

- ``medium``
    Medium resolutions (default is 720p)

- ``high``
    High resolutions (default is 1080p)

- ``ultra_high``
    Ultra high resolutions (default is 4K)

- ``default_resolutions``
    Default resolutions (one of the above four, default is high)

``fps``
-------

Export frame rate. (default is 30)

About

About Manim
-----------

Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. 
You can use it to make math videos (or other fields) like 3Blue1Brown.

There are mainly two versions here:

- `3b1b/manim <https://github.com/3b1b/manim>`_ : Maintained by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown.

Using OpenGL and its GLSL language to use GPU for rendering. It has higher efficiency, 
faster rendering speed, and supports real-time rendering and interaction.

- `ManimCommunity/manim <https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim>`_ : Maintained by Manim Community Dev Team.

Using multiple backend rendering. There is better documentation and 
a more open contribution community.

About this documentation
------------------------

This documentation is based on the version in `3b1b/manim <https://github.com/3b1b/manim>`_. 
Created by `TonyCrane <https://github.com/TonyCrane>`_ ("Èπ§Áøî‰∏áÈáå" in Chinese) and in production.

Among them, the ``manim_example_ext`` extension for Sphinx refers to 
`the documentation of ManimCommunity <https://docs.manim.community/>`_.
