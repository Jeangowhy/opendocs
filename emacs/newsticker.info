# /. 1 Overview
**************

Newsticker provides a Feed Reader for Emacs.  It retrieves headlines
from a list of news sites, processes them, and provides frontends for
reading and managing them.  (Standard headline formats are RSS and Atom
which makes Newsticker an “RSS Reader”, “Atom Reader” or “Feed
Aggregator”.)

   Headlines (or news items) consist of a title, (mostly) a description,
and a link to the full story.  The description may be a brief summary in
plain text or a full HTML-formatted article.  A headline may carry
enclosed data such as images, audio or video files, typically in the
case of so “podcast feeds”.

   Newsticker downloads headlines asynchronously at configurable times,
processes and stores them so that you can read them later.  The list of
subscribed feeds, the headline processing, the presentation of the
headlines and almost all other aspects of Newsticker can be customized
to your liking.

# /. 2 Installation
******************

As Newsticker is part of GNU Emacs there is no need to perform any
installation steps in order to use it.

   Newsticker is highly customizable.  All options have reasonable
default values, so that (in most cases) it is not necessary to customize
anything before you start Newsticker for the first time.


File: newsticker.info,  Node: Retrieving News,  Next: Headline Management,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

# /. 3 Retrieving News
*********************

Newsticker downloads news periodically in the background.  This is
triggered as soon as you start reading news (*note Reading News::).

   Alternatively you may use the command ‘newsticker-start’
(‘newsticker-stop’) in order to start (stop) the periodic download of
news without opening the reader.

   The following variables define which feeds are fetched and how this
is done.

‘newsticker-url-list-defaults’
     You may select any number of feeds from this list of (sample) news
     feeds.

‘newsticker-url-list’
     All your personal news feeds are defined here.  Each feed is
     identified by its name and an URL.  You may set the start-time and
     the retrieval interval for each feed as well as the retrieval
     command arguments in case that the default values do not fit a
     certain feed.

‘newsticker-retrieval-method’
     By default Newsticker uses Emacs’s built-in download capabilities
     for fetching headlines.  You may change this to use an external
     tool like ‘wget’.  In this case you need to set
     ‘newsticker-wget-name’ and possibly ‘newsticker-wget-arguments’.

‘newsticker-retrieval-interval’
     The number of seconds between headline retrievals.


File: newsticker.info,  Node: Headline Management,  Next: Reading News,  Prev: Retrieving News,  Up: Top

# /. 4 Headline Management
*************************

Newsticker assigns a status (or “age”) to each headline which you can
modify manually.  This makes it easy to distinguish new headlines from
old ones, to keep important headlines, to hide boring headlines etc.  An
item is “new” when it has just arrived and has not been read.  You can
mark it as “old” when you have read it or – if you want to keep it – you
can mark it as “immortal”.  You can do that manually and you can define
filters which do that automatically, see below.  When a headline has
vanished from the feed it is automatically marked as “obsolete” unless
it has the status “immortal”.  “Obsolete” headlines get removed
automatically after a certain time.

‘newsticker-auto-mark-filter-list’
     You may define any number of filters for automatically marking
     newly arrived headlines as “immortal” or “old”.  A filter looks for
     a regular expression in either the title or the description of a
     headline and then, if the expression matches, marks the headline as
     “immortal” or as “old”.  This is done only once, when a headline is
     fetched for the very first time.

‘newsticker-keep-obsolete-items’
     Obsolete headlines are removed immediately unless
     ‘newsticker-keep-obsolete-items’ is non-‘nil’ in which case they
     are kept until ‘newsticker-obsolete-item-max-age’ is reached.

‘newsticker-automatically-mark-items-as-old’
     If this is set to ‘t’ then a “new” item becomes “old” as soon as it
     is retrieved a second time.

# /. 5 Reading News
******************

Start Newsticker with the command ‘M-x newsticker-show-news’.  This will
start the asynchronous news download and displays all available
headlines.

* Menu:

* Frontends::        Select the way headlines are displayed.
* Navigation::       Move to the next unread headline etc.
* Marking::          Mark important headlines.
* More Actions::     Add new feeds etc..


File: newsticker.info,  Node: Frontends,  Next: Navigation,  Up: Reading News

# /. 5.1 Frontends
=================

Newsticker provides two different views for browsing, marking and
reading news.  The variable ‘newsticker-frontend’ determines the actual
headline reader.

Treeview
--------

In this view separate windows are used for displaying feeds, headlines
and their descriptions.  The feeds are shown as a tree on the left hand
side, headlines of the currently selected feed are shown on the upper
right side, and the full contents of the currently selected headline is
shown on the lower right side.

   Feeds can be placed into groups, which themselves can be placed in
groups and so on.  This results in the tree which is displayed on the
left.  A node represents either a feed or a group of feeds holding a
subtree.  The following commands allow for managing groups.

‘M-a’
     Add a new feed group.  Name of the new group and of the parent
     group must be entered.  If The name of the parent group is the new
     group becomes a top-level group.  (‘newsticker-group-add-group’)
‘M-m’
     Moves a feed into a group.  The name of the group must be entered.
     (‘newsticker-group-move-feed’)

   The position of groups and feeds within the tree can be changed with
these commands:

‘M-<UP>’
‘M-<DOWN>’
     Shift the currently selected feed up and down within its group.
‘M-S-<UP>’
‘M-S-<DOWN>’
     Shift the currently selected group up and down within its parent
     group.

   The group settings are saved to a file either automatically when
newsticker is being quit or manually when the following command is
executed.

‘s’
     Save treeview group settings.

   The Treeview is updated automatically as soon as new headlines have
arrived.

   The Treeview is used when the variable ‘newsticker-frontend’ is set
to the value ‘newsticker-treeview’.  (Alternatively it can be started
with the command ‘newsticker-treeview’.)

Plainview
---------

In this view all headlines of all feeds are displayed in a single buffer
(‘*newsticker*’).  The modeline in the ‘*newsticker*’ buffer informs you
whenever new headlines have arrived.

   You may want to use imenu with Plainview, which allows for navigating
with the help of a menu.  In this case add the following to your Emacs
startup file (‘~/.emacs’).

     (add-hook 'newsticker-mode-hook 'imenu-add-menubar-index)

   (Note that preparing the Plainview takes significantly more time than
starting the Treeview because all headlines are displayed in a single
buffer.  When you have subscribed to a large amount of feeds you may
find that Newsticker’s efforts of minimizing rendering times, caching
rendered items and so on you may find However, when you have subscribed
to a large amount of feeds you may want to give the Treeview a try.)

   The Plainview is used when the variable ‘newsticker-frontend’ is set
to the value ‘newsticker-plainview’.  (Alternatively it can be started
with the command ‘newsticker-plainview’.)

Ticker
------

Additionally, headlines can be displayed in the echo area in the style
of a news ticker.

   Headlines can be displayed in the echo area, either scrolling like
messages in a stock-quote ticker, or just changing.  This can be started
with the command ‘newsticker-start-ticker’.  It can be stopped with
‘newsticker-stop-ticker’.

Navigating through the list of feeds and headlines is rather
straightforward.  You may do this either with the mouse or with the
keyboard.  The following key bindings are provided in both, the Treeview
as well as the Plainview.

‘f’
     Move to next feed (‘newsticker-next-feed’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-next-feed’).
‘F’
     Move to previous feed (‘newsticker-previous-feed’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-prev-feed’).
‘n’
     Move to next item (‘newsticker-next-item’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-next-item’).
‘N’
     Move to next new item (possibly in another feed)
     (‘newsticker-next-new-item’, ‘newsticker-treeview-next-new-item’).
‘p’
     Move to previous item (‘newsticker-previous-item’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-prev-item’).
‘P’
     Move to previous new item (possibly in another feed)
     (‘newsticker-previous-new-item’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-prev-new-item’).

Treeview
--------

‘j’
     Enter the name of a feed and jump to it
     (‘newsticker-treeview-jump’).

# /. 5.3 Marking
===============

The following key bindings are provided in both, the Treeview as well as
the Plainview.

‘o’
     Mark current item as old.
     (‘newsticker-mark-item-at-point-as-read’,
     ‘newsticker-treeview-mark-item-old’).
‘i’
     Mark current item as immortal.  Immortal items are kept forever.
     (‘newsticker-mark-item-at-point-as-immortal’,

     details of the new feed can be set.


File: newsticker.info,  Node: Automatic Processing,  Next: Configuration,  Prev: Reading News,  Up: Top

# /. 6 Automatic Processing
**************************

Apart from automatic marking of headlines (by means of filters)
Newsticker provides the possibility to fully process newly arrived
headlines.  Instead of reading headlines yourself you can tell
Newsticker to do that for you.

   In order to do so write a function which takes two arguments

FEEDNAME
     the name of the corresponding news feed,
ITEM
     the decoded headline.

   and add it to ‘newsticker-new-item-functions’.  Each function
contained in this list is called once for each new headline.  Depending
on the feed name and the contents of the new headline you can

   • automatically download images referenced in HTML-formatted
     descriptions (for which a function already exists, see
     ‘newsticker-download-images’),
   • automatically save enclosed audio and video files (for which
     another function exists as well, see
     ‘newsticker-download-enclosures’),
   • flash the screen while playing some sound,
   • whatever you want.

# /. 7 Configuration
*******************

All Newsticker options are customizable, i.e., they can be changed with
Emacs customization methods.  Call the command ‘customize-group’ and
enter ‘newsticker’ for the customization group.

The following list shows the available groups of Newsticker options and
some of the most important options.

   • ‘newsticker-retrieval’ contains options that define which news
     feeds are retrieved and how this is done.

        • ‘newsticker-url-list’ defines the list of headlines that are
          retrieved.
        • ‘newsticker-retrieval-method’ defines how headlines are
          retrieved.  This is either done using Emacs’s built-in
          download capabilities or using an external tool.
        • ‘newsticker-retrieval-interval’ defines how often headlines
          are retrieved.

   • ‘newsticker-headline-processing’ contains options that define how
     the retrieved headlines are processed.

        • ‘newsticker-keep-obsolete-items’ decides whether unread
          headlines that have been removed from the feed are kept in the
          Newsticker cache.
        • ‘newsticker-auto-mark-filter-list’ provides the possibility to
          automatically mark headlines as immortal or old.

   • ‘newsticker-hooks’ contains options for hooking other Emacs
     commands to newsticker functions.
        • ‘newsticker-new-item-functions’ allows for automatic
          processing of headlines.  See ‘newsticker-download-images’,
          and ‘newsticker-download-enclosures’ for sample functions.
        • The subgroup ‘newsticker-plainview-hooks’ contains hooks that
          apply to the plainview reader only.

   • ‘newsticker-miscellaneous’ contains other Newsticker options.

   • ‘newsticker-ticker’ contains options that define how headlines are
     shown in the echo area, i.e., the “ticker”.

        • ‘newsticker-ticker-interval’ and ‘newsticker-scroll-smoothly’
          define how headlines are shown in the echo area.

   • ‘newsticker-reader’ contains options for adjusting the headline
     reader.

        • ‘newsticker-frontend’ determines the actual headline reader.
          The “plainview” reader uses a single buffer, the “treeview”
          uses separate buffers and windows.

        • The subgroup ‘newsticker-plainview’ contains options for the
          plainview reader.
        • The subgroup ‘newsticker-treeview’ contains options for the
          treeview reader.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

# /. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
