# /. 1 Overview
**************

EasyPG Assistant is an Emacs frontend application to GnuPG (GNU Privacy
Guard) that provides the following features:

   • Key management.
   • Cryptographic operations on regions.
   • Cryptographic operations on files.
   • Dired integration.
   • Mail-mode integration.
   • Automatic encryption/decryption of *.gpg files.

# /. 2 Quick Start
*****************

You can use EasyPG Assistant without any Emacs or GnuPG configuration
whatsoever, for example to encrypt and decrypt files automatically with
symmetric encryption, see *note Encrypting/decrypting gpg files::.
However, to use the full set of EasyPG Assistant’s functions you should
have at least some minimum GnuPG configuration in place.

   John Michael Ashley’s GNU Privacy Handbook, available online as part
of the GnuPG user guides (https://gnupg.org/documentation/guides.html),
provides an introduction to GnuPG use and configuration.  In contrast to
that, the GnuPG manual (*note Top: (gnupg)Top.) is more of a reference
manual.

   EasyPG Assistant commands are prefixed by ‘epa-’.  For example,

   • To browse your keyring, type ‘M-x epa-list-keys’

   • To create a cleartext signature of the region, type ‘M-x
     epa-sign-region’

   • To encrypt a file, type ‘M-x epa-encrypt-file’

   • To query a key server for keys, type ‘M-x epa-search-keys’

   EasyPG Assistant provides several cryptographic features which can be
integrated into other Emacs functionalities.  For example, automatic
encryption/decryption of ‘*.gpg’ files.

# /. 3.1 Key Management
======================

Probably the first step of using EasyPG Assistant is to browse your
keyring.  ‘M-x epa-list-keys’ is corresponding to ‘gpg --list-keys’ from
the command line.

 -- Command: epa-list-keys name mode
     Show all keys matched with NAME from the public keyring.

The output looks as follows.

       u A5B6B2D4B15813FE Daiki Ueno <ueno@unixuser.org>

A character on the leftmost column indicates the trust level of the key.
If it is ‘u’, the key is marked as ultimately trusted.  The second
column is the key ID, and the rest is the user ID.

   You can move over entries by <TAB>.  If you type <RET> or click
button1 on an entry, you will see more detailed information about the
key you selected.

      u Daiki Ueno <ueno@unixuser.org>
      u A5B6B2D4B15813FE 1024bits DSA
             Created: 2001-10-09
             Expires: 2007-09-04
             Capabilities: sign certify
             Fingerprint: 8003 7CD0 0F1A 9400 03CA  50AA A5B6 B2D4 B158 13FE
      u 4447461B2A9BEA2D 2048bits ELGAMAL_E
             Created: 2001-10-09
             Expires: 2007-09-04
             Capabilities: encrypt
             Fingerprint: 9003 D76B 73B7 4A8A E588  10AF 4447 461B 2A9B EA2D

To browse your private keyring, use ‘M-x epa-list-secret-keys’.

 -- Command: epa-list-secret-keys name
     Show all keys matched with NAME from the private keyring.

In ‘*Keys*’ buffer, several commands are available.  The common use case
is to export some keys to a file.  To do that, type ‘m’ to select keys,
type ‘o’, and then supply the filename.

   Below are other commands related to key management.  Some of them
take a file as input/output, and others take the current region.

 -- Command: epa-insert-keys keys
     Insert selected KEYS after the point.  It will let you select keys
     before insertion.  By default, it will encode keys in the OpenPGP
     armor format.

 -- Command: epa-import-keys file
     Import keys from FILE to your keyring.

 -- Command: epa-import-keys-region start end
     Import keys from the current region between START and END to your
     keyring.

 -- Command: epa-import-armor-in-region start end
     Import keys in the OpenPGP armor format in the current region
     between START and END.  The difference from
     ‘epa-import-keys-region’ is that ‘epa-import-armor-in-region’
     searches armors in the region and applies ‘epa-import-keys-region’
     to each of them.

 -- Command: epa-delete-keys allow-secret
     Delete selected keys.  If ALLOW-SECRET is non-‘nil’, it also delete
     the secret keys.

# /. 3.2 Cryptographic Operations on Regions
===========================================

 -- Command: epa-decrypt-region start end
     Decrypt the current region between START and END.  It replaces the
     region with the decrypted text.

 -- Command: epa-decrypt-armor-in-region start end
     Decrypt OpenPGP armors in the current region between START and END.
     The difference from ‘epa-decrypt-region’ is that
     ‘epa-decrypt-armor-in-region’ searches armors in the region and
     applies ‘epa-decrypt-region’ to each of them.  That is, this
     command does not alter the original text around armors.

 -- Command: epa-verify-region start end
     Verify the current region between START and END.  It sends the
     verification result to the minibuffer or a popup window.  It
     replaces the region with the signed text.

 -- Command: epa-verify-cleartext-in-region
     Verify OpenPGP cleartext blocks in the current region between START
     and END.  The difference from ‘epa-verify-region’ is that
     ‘epa-verify-cleartext-in-region’ searches OpenPGP cleartext blocks
     in the region and applies ‘epa-verify-region’ to each of them.
     That is, this command does not alter the original text around
     OpenPGP cleartext blocks.

 -- Command: epa-sign-region start end signers type
     Sign the current region between START and END.  By default, it
     creates a cleartext signature.  If a prefix argument is given, it
     will let you select signing keys, and then a signature type.

 -- Command: epa-encrypt-region start end recipients sign signers
     Encrypt the current region between START and END.  It will let you
     select recipients.  If a prefix argument is given, it will also ask
     you whether or not to sign the text before encryption and if you
     answered yes, it will let you select the signing keys.

# /. 3.3 Cryptographic Operations on Files
=========================================

 -- Command: epa-decrypt-file file &optional output
     Decrypt FILE.  If you do not specify the name OUTPUT to use for the
     decrypted file, this function prompts for the value to use.

 -- Command: epa-verify-file file
     Verify FILE.

 -- Command: epa-sign-file file signers type
     Sign FILE.  If a prefix argument is given, it will let you select
     signing keys, and then a signature type.

 -- Command: epa-encrypt-file file recipients
     Encrypt FILE.  It will let you select recipients.


File: epa.info,  Node: Dired integration,  Next: Mail-mode integration,  Prev: Cryptographic operations on files,  Up: Commands

# /. 3.4 Dired Integration
=========================

EasyPG Assistant extends Dired Mode for GNU Emacs to allow users to
easily do cryptographic operations on files.  For example,

     M-x dired
     (mark some files)
     : e (or M-x epa-dired-do-encrypt)
     (select recipients by 'm' and click [OK])

The following keys are assigned.

‘: d’
     Decrypt marked files.

‘: v’
     Verify marked files.

‘: s’
     Sign marked files.

‘: e’
     Encrypt marked files.


File: epa.info,  Node: Mail-mode integration,  Next: Encrypting/decrypting gpg files,  Prev: Dired integration,  Up: Commands

# /. 3.5 Mail-Mode Integration
=============================

EasyPG Assistant provides a minor mode ‘epa-mail-mode’ to help user
compose inline OpenPGP messages.  Inline OpenPGP is a traditional style
of sending signed/encrypted emails by embedding raw OpenPGP blobs inside
a message body, not using modern MIME format.

   NOTE: Inline OpenPGP is not recommended and you should consider to
use PGP/MIME.  See Inline OpenPGP in E-mail is bad, Mm’kay?
(https://josefsson.org/inline-openpgp-considered-harmful.html).

Once ‘epa-mail-mode’ is enabled, the following keys are assigned.  You
can do it by ‘C-u 1 M-x epa-mail-mode’ or through the Customize
interface.  Try ‘M-x customize-variable epa-global-mail-mode’.

‘C-c C-e C-d and C-c C-e d’
     Decrypt OpenPGP armors in the current buffer.

‘C-c C-e C-v and C-c C-e v’
     Verify OpenPGP cleartext signed messages in the current buffer.

‘C-c C-e C-s and C-c C-e s’
     Compose a signed message from the current buffer, using your
     default key.  With a prefix argument, select the key to use
     interactively.

‘C-c C-e C-e and C-c C-e e’
     Compose an encrypted message from the current buffer.  By default
     it tries to build the recipient list from ‘to’, ‘cc’, and ‘bcc’
     fields of the mail header.  To include your key in the recipient
     list, use ‘encrypt-to’ option in ‘~/.gnupg/gpg.conf’.  This
     function translates recipient addresses using the
     ‘epa-mail-aliases’ list.  You can also use that option to ignore
     specific recipients for encryption purposes.

     With prefix argument, asks you to select the recipients
     interactively, whether to sign, and which key(s) to sign with.


File: epa.info,  Node: Encrypting/decrypting gpg files,  Next: Querying a key server,  Prev: Mail-mode integration,  Up: Commands

# /. 3.6 Encrypting and Decrypting gpg Files
===========================================

By default, every file whose name ends with ‘.gpg’ will be treated as
encrypted.  That is, when you open such a file, the decrypted text is
inserted in the buffer rather than encrypted one.  Similarly, when you
save the buffer to a ‘foo.gpg’ file, encrypted data is written.

   When you save a buffer to an encrypted file for the first time,
EasyPG Assistant presents you a list of keys in a buffer ‘*Keys*’ where
you can select recipients for encryption.  *Note Key management::, for a
description of the format of that buffer.  You can streamline this
recipient selection step by customizing variables ‘epa-file-encrypt-to’
and ‘epa-file-select-keys’ described further below in this section.

   If you do not select any recipient during this step, EasyPG Assistant
uses symmetric encryption.  As a consequence, you have to enter the
passphrase twice for every buffer save and every so often for file
reads, since the GnuPG Agent caches your passphrase for file reads at
least for some time, but not for buffer saves.  *Note Caching
Passphrases::, for more information.

   If you have created your own keypair(1), you can select that as
recipient, and EasyPG Assistant will use public key encryption for that
file.  Since GnuPG performs encryption with your public key, it does not
prompt for a passphrase for the buffer save, but it will prompt for your
passphrase for file reads every now and then, depending on the GnuPG
Agent cache configuration.

   To encrypt and decrypt files as described above EasyPG Assistant
under certain circumstances uses intermediate tempory files that contain
the plain-text contents of the files it processes.  EasyPG Assistant
creates them below the directory returned by function
‘temporary-file-directory’ (*note Generating Unique File Names:
(elisp)Unique File Names.).  If you want to be sure not to leave any
plain-text traces, use an encrypted file systems at least for that
directory.

   The file name pattern for encrypted files can be controlled by
‘epa-file-name-regexp’.

 -- Variable: epa-file-name-regexp
     Regexp which matches filenames treated as encrypted.

   You can disable this behavior with ‘M-x epa-file-disable’, and then
get it back with ‘M-x epa-file-enable’.

 -- Command: epa-file-disable
     Disable automatic encryption/decryption of *.gpg files.

 -- Command: epa-file-enable
     Enable automatic encryption/decryption of *.gpg files.

By default, ‘epa-file’ will try to use symmetric encryption, aka
password-based encryption.  If you want to use public key encryption
instead, do ‘M-x epa-file-select-keys’, which pops up the key selection
dialog.

 -- Command: epa-file-select-keys
     Select recipient keys to encrypt the currently visiting file with
     public key encryption.

   You can also change the default behavior with the variable
‘epa-file-select-keys’.

 -- Variable: epa-file-select-keys
     Control whether or not to pop up the key selection dialog.

   For frequently visited files, it might be a good idea to tell Emacs
which encryption method should be used through file variables (*note
Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File Variables.).  Use the
‘epa-file-encrypt-to’ local variable for this.

   For example, if you want an Elisp file to be encrypted with a public
key associated with an email address ‘ueno@unixuser.org’, add the
following line to the beginning of the file.

     ;; -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("ueno@unixuser.org") -*-

   Instead, if you want the file always (regardless of the value of the
‘epa-file-select-keys’ variable) encrypted with symmetric encryption,
change the line as follows.

     ;; -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: nil -*-

   Other variables which control the automatic encryption/decryption
behavior are below.

 -- Variable: epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption
     If non-‘nil’, cache passphrase for symmetric encryption.  The
     default value is ‘nil’.

     For security reasons, this option is turned off by default and not
     recommended to be used.  Instead, consider using the GnuPG Agent,
     which in many cases can do the same job, and does it in a safer
     way.  *Note Caching Passphrases::, for more information.

 -- Variable: epa-file-inhibit-auto-save
     If non-‘nil’, disable auto-saving when opening an encrypted file.
     The default value is ‘t’.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For encryption and decryption of files you do not intend to
share, you do not have to use an email address as recipient during
creation of the keypair.  You can also use some free-form string that
gives information on the use of the keypair, like ‘backup’ or ‘account
database’.


File: epa.info,  Node: Querying a key server,  Prev: Encrypting/decrypting gpg files,  Up: Commands

# /. 3.7 Querying a Key Server
=============================

The ‘epa-search-keys’ command can be used to query a GPG key server.
Emacs will then pop up a buffer that lists the matches, and you can then
fetch (and add) keys to your personal key ring.

   In the key search buffer, you can use the ‘f’ command to mark keys
for fetching, and then ‘x’ to fetch the keys (and incorporate them into
your key ring).

   The ‘epa-keyserver’ variable says which server to query.

# /. 4 GnuPG Version Compatibility
*********************************

As of June 2023, there are three active branches of GnuPG: 2.4, 2.2, and
1.4.  GnuPG versions 2.4.1 and later suffer from GnuPG bug T6481
(https://dev.gnupg.org/T6481) and are hardly usable with Emacs.  There
is a patch for that bug available at least for GnuPG version 2.4.1,
which your operating system or distribution might provide already.
GnuPG 1.4 is considered a legacy version.

   Besides that, all of those branches mentioned above should work
flawlessly with Emacs with basic use-cases.  They have, however, some
incompatible characteristics, which might be visible when used from
Emacs.

   • The key store format used by GnuPG 2.1 is incompatible with 1.4.
     That means, a key created with GnuPG 2.1 is not visible with 1.4.

   • GnuPG 2.1 uses a fixed address for the Unix domain socket used to
     communicate with ‘gpg-agent’.  The ‘GPG_AGENT_INFO’ environment
     variable, which is used by GnuPG 2.0 and 1.4, is ignored.  That
     means, if your system has both GnuPG 2.1 and 1.4, the gpg command
     from GnuPG 1.4 is not able to use ‘gpg-agent’ provided by 2.1 (at
     least out of box).

   • GnuPG 2.1 (2.1.5 or later) has a mechanism to direct the Pinentry
     password prompt to the Emacs minibuffer.  *Note GnuPG Pinentry::.


File: epa.info,  Node: GnuPG Pinentry,  Next: Caching Passphrases,  Prev: GnuPG version compatibility,  Up: Top

# /. 5 GnuPG Pinentry
********************

An important component of the GnuPG suite is the Pinentry, which allows
for secure entry of passphrases requested by GnuPG. GnuPG delivers
various different programs as Pinentry, ranging from bland TTY-only
‘pinentry-tty’ to fancy graphical dialogs for various desktop
environments, like ‘pinentry-gnome3’.  Your operating system usually
determines which of these is used by default.

   Note that the selection of a concrete Pinentry program determines
only _how_ GnuPG queries for passphrases and not _how often_.  For the
latter question see *note Caching Passphrases::.

   With some configuration Emacs can also play the role of a Pinentry.
The most natural choice, available with GnuPG 2.1.5 and later, is to use
Emacs itself as Pinentry for requests that are triggered by Emacs.  For
example, if you open a file whose name ends with ‘.gpg’ using automatic
decryption, you most likely also want to enter the passphrase for that
request in Emacs.

   This so called “loopback Pinentry” has the added benefit that it
works also when you use Emacs remotely or from a text-only terminal.  To
enable it:

  1. Ensure that option ‘allow-loopback-pinentry’ is configured for
     ‘gpg-agent’, which should be the default.  *Note Option Summary:
     (gnupg)Agent Options.

  2. Customize variable ‘epg-pinentry-mode’ to ‘loopback’ in Emacs.

   There are other options available to use Emacs as Pinentry, you might
come across a Pinentry called ‘pinentry-emacs’ or ‘gpg-agent’ option
‘allow-emacs-pinentry’.  However, these are considered insecure or
semi-obsolete and might not be supported by your operating system or
distribution.  For example, Debian GNU/Linux supports only the loopback
Pinentry described above.

# /. 6 Caching Passphrases
*************************

Typing passphrases is a troublesome task if you frequently open and
close the same file.  GnuPG and EasyPG Assistant provide mechanisms to
remember your passphrases for a limited time.  Using these, you only
need to re-enter the passphrase occasionally.  However, the
configuration is a bit confusing since it depends on your GnuPG
installation (*note GnuPG version compatibility::), encryption method
(symmetric or public key), and whether or not you want to use GnuPG
Agent.  As an additional constraint, use of the GnuPG Agent is mandatory
for GnuPG 2.0 and later.  Here are some questions:

  1. Do you use GnuPG version 2.0 or later instead of GnuPG version 1.4?
  2. Do you use symmetric encryption rather than public key encryption?
  3. Do you want to use GnuPG Agent?

   Here are configurations depending on your answers:

1     2     3     Configuration
Yes   Yes   Must  Set up GnuPG Agent.
Yes   No    Must  Set up GnuPG Agent.
No    Yes   Yes   Set up elisp passphrase cache.
No    Yes   No    Set up elisp passphrase cache.
No    No    Yes   Set up GnuPG Agent.
No    No    No    You can’t, without GnuPG Agent.

   To set up GnuPG Agent, follow the instruction in *note
(gnupg)Invoking GPG-AGENT::.

   To set up elisp passphrase cache, set
‘epa-file-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption’.  *Note

     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

# /. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
