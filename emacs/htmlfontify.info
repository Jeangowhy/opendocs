# /. 1 Introduction
******************

Htmlfontify provides a means of converting individual Emacs buffers,
source files, or entire source trees to html, preserving formatting and
Emacs colorization / syntax highlighting as much as possible through
careful application of CSS stylesheets and html tags.

   It can also turn instances of functions, methods and (for some
languages) variables and other constructs and items into links to their
definitions, and create an index file (or files) of all such symbols,
also linked to their points of definition.

   Htmlfontify also provides several customization items, which should
allow it to mesh more-or-less seamlessly with various templating or
publishing systems (in the event, for instance, that you don’t want to
produce the html pages directly).

# /. 2 Usage & Examples
**********************

Htmlfontify can be used both interactively and as part of another elisp
function.  If you’re running it in a modern Emacs, it will also run when
attached to a terminal (i.e., without X) or even when in batch mode.

# /. 2.1 Interactive
===================

Htmlfontify provides the following interactive functions:

‘htmlfontify-buffer’


          (htmlfontify-buffer &optional SRCDIR FILE)

     Create a new buffer, named for the current buffer + a .html
     extension, containing an inline CSS-stylesheet and formatted
     CSS-markup html that reproduces the look of the current Emacs
     buffer as closely as possible.

     “Dangerous” characters in the existing buffer are turned into html
     entities, so you should even be able to do html-within-html
     fontified display.

     You should, however, note that random control or non-ASCII
     characters such as ^L (U+000C FORM FEED (FF)) or ¤ (U+00A4 CURRENCY
     SIGN) won’t get mapped yet.

     If the SRCDIR and FILE arguments are set, lookup etags derived
     entries in the *note hfy-tags-cache:: and add html anchors and
     hyperlinks as appropriate.

‘htmlfontify-run-etags’


          (htmlfontify-run-etags SRCDIR)

     Load the etags cache for SRCDIR.  See *note hfy-load-tags-cache::.

‘htmlfontify-copy-and-link-dir’


          (htmlfontify-copy-and-link-dir SRCDIR DSTDIR &optional F-EXT L-EXT)

     Trawl SRCDIR and write fontified-and-hyperlinked output in DSTDIR.
     F-EXT and L-EXT specify values for *note hfy-extn:: and *note
     hfy-link-extn::.

     You may also want to set *note hfy-page-header:: and *note
     hfy-page-footer::.

‘htmlfontify-load-rgb-file’


          (htmlfontify-load-rgb-file &optional FILE)

     Load an X11 style rgb.txt file (search ‘hfy-rgb-load-path’ if FILE
     is not specified).

     Note that this is not necessary if all you want is the standard X11
     (XFree86 4.1.0) color name -> rgb triplet mapping.  Htmlfontify has
     a copy built in, for use when it cannot contact an X server.

     Loads the variable ‘hfy-rgb-txt-color-map’, which is used by *note
     hfy-fallback-color-values::.

‘htmlfontify-unload-rgb-file’


          (htmlfontify-unload-rgb-file)

     Unload the currently loaded X11 style rgb.txt file (if any).

# /. 2.2 Non-interactive
=======================

In addition to the aforementioned interactive methods, Htmlfontify
provides the following non-interactive ones:

‘hfy-face-to-style’


          (hfy-face-to-style FN)

     Take FN, a font or ‘defface’ style font specification, (as returned
     by ‘face-attr-construct’ or *note hfy-face-attr-for-class::) and
     return a *note hfy-style-assoc::.

     See also: *note hfy-face-to-style-i::, *note hfy-flatten-style::.

‘hfy-fallback-color-values’


          (hfy-fallback-color-values COLOR-STRING)

     Use a fallback method for obtaining the rgb values for a color.  If
     *note htmlfontify-load-rgb-file:: has been called, it uses the
     color map specified, otherwise it uses Htmlfontify’s built in map.

‘hfy-combined-face-spec’


          (hfy-combined-face-spec FACE)

     Return a ‘defface’ style alist of possible specifications for FACE,
     with any entries resulting from user customization
     (‘custom-set-faces’) taking precedence.

     See also: *note hfy-default-face-def::

‘hfy-word-regex’


          (hfy-word-regex STRING)

     Return a regex that matches STRING as the first ‘match-string’,
     with non word characters on either side (vaguely emulating the perl
     ‘\b’ regex atom).

‘hfy-force-fontification’


          (hfy-force-fontification)

     Emacs’s fontification is designed for interactive use.  As such, it
     sometimes does things like deferring fontification until a section
     of the buffer is exposed and rendered, or until Emacs is idle for a
     while.  Sometimes, in non-interactive circumstances, or if it can’t
     see X, it doesn’t bother with some of the harder stuff.  While this
     is all great from the perspective of a user waiting for Emacs to
     load a 20000 line file and colorize it, it’s a pain from the point
     of view from non-interactive code.  This function lies, cheats,
     steals and generally bullies Emacs into fontifying a buffer from
     start to finish, with all the extra frills, whether it thinks it
     needs to or not.  Oh yes: it operates on the current buffer.

‘hfy-link-style-string’


          (hfy-link-style-string STYLE-STRING)

     Replace the end of a CSS style declaration STYLE-STRING with the
     contents of the variable *note hfy-src-doc-link-style::, removing
     text matching the regex *note hfy-src-doc-link-unstyle:: first, if
     necessary.

‘hfy-prepare-index-i’


          (hfy-prepare-index-i SRCDIR DSTDIR FILENAME &optional STUB MAP)

     Prepare a tags index buffer for SRCDIR.  *note hfy-tags-cache::
     must already have an entry for SRCDIR for this to work.  *note
     hfy-page-header::, *note hfy-page-footer::, *note hfy-link-extn::
     and *note hfy-extn:: all play a part here.

     If STUB is set, prepare an (appropriately named) index buffer
     specifically for entries beginning with STUB.

     If MAP is set, use that instead of *note hfy-tags-cache::.

‘hfy-compile-stylesheet’


          (hfy-compile-stylesheet)

     Trawl the current buffer, construct and return a *note
     hfy-sheet-assoc::.

‘hfy-css-name’


          (hfy-css-name FN)

     Strip some of the boring bits from a font-name and return a CSS
     style name.  If FN is a ‘defface’ attribute list, either construct
     a name for it, store it in the cache, and return it, or just fetch
     it from the cache if it’s already there.

‘hfy-make-directory’


          (hfy-make-directory DIR)

     Approximate equivalent of ‘mkdir -p DIR’.

‘hfy-triplet’


          (hfy-triplet COLOR)

     Takes a color name (string) and return a CSS rgb(R, G, B) triplet
     string.  Uses the definition of “white” to map the numbers to the
     0-255 range, so if you’ve redefined white, (especially if you’ve
     redefined it to have a triplet member lower than that of the color
     you are processing, strange things may happen).

‘hfy-default-footer’


          (hfy-default-footer FILE)

     Default value for *note hfy-page-footer::

‘hfy-list-files’


          (hfy-list-files DIRECTORY)

     Return a list of files under DIRECTORY.  Strips any leading ‘./’
     from each filename.

‘hfy-color-vals’


          (hfy-color-vals COLOR)

     Where COLOR is a color name or #XXXXXX style triplet, return a list
     of 3 (16 bit) rgb values for said color.  If a window system is
     unavailable, calls *note hfy-fallback-color-values::.

‘hfy-href-stub’


          (hfy-href-stub THIS-FILE DEF-FILES TAG)

     Return an href stub for a tag href: if DEF-FILES (list of files
     containing definitions for the tag in question) contains only one
     entry, the href should link straight to that file.  Otherwise, the
     link should be to the index file.

     We are not yet concerned with the file extensions/tag line number
     and so on at this point.

     If *note hfy-split-index:: is set, and the href will be to an index
     file rather than a source file, append a ‘.X’ to *note
     hfy-index-file::, where ‘X’ is the uppercased first character of
     TAG.

     See also: *note hfy-relstub::, *note hfy-index-file::.

‘hfy-line-number’


          (hfy-line-number)

     Returns the line number of the point in the current buffer.

‘hfy-merge-adjacent-spans’


          (hfy-merge-adjacent-spans FACE-MAP)

     Where FACE-MAP is a *note hfy-facemap-assoc:: for the current
     buffer, this function merges adjacent style blocks which are of the
     same value and are separated by nothing more interesting than
     whitespace.

     ‘<span class="foo">narf</span> <span class="foo">brain</span>’

     (as interpreted from FACE-MAP) would become:

     ‘<span class="foo">narf brain</span>’

     Returns a modified copy of FACE-MAP (also a *note
     hfy-facemap-assoc::).

‘hfy-mark-tag-names’


          (hfy-mark-tag-names SRCDIR FILE)

     Mark tags in FILE (lookup SRCDIR in *note hfy-tags-cache::) with
     the ‘hfy-anchor’ property, with a value of ‘tag.line-number’.

‘hfy-weight’


          (hfy-weight WEIGHT)

     Derive a font-weight CSS specifier from an Emacs weight
     specification symbol.

‘hfy-size’


          (hfy-size HEIGHT)

     Derive a CSS font-size specifier from an Emacs font ‘:height’
     attribute.  Does not cope with the case where height is a function
     to be applied to the height of the underlying font.

‘hfy-default-header’


          (hfy-default-header FILE STYLE)

     Default value for *note hfy-page-header::

‘hfy-family’


          (hfy-family FAMILY)

     Derives a CSS font-family specifier from an Emacs ‘:family’
     attribute.

‘hfy-mark-tag-hrefs’


          (hfy-mark-tag-hrefs SRCDIR FILE)

     Mark href start points with the ‘hfy-link’ property (value: href
     string).

     Mark href end points with the ‘hfy-endl’ property (value ‘t’).

     Avoid overlapping links, and mark links in descending length of tag
     name in order to prevent subtags from usurping supertags; e.g.,
     “term” for “terminal”).

‘hfy-box’


          (hfy-box BOX)

     Derive CSS border-* attributes from the Emacs ‘:box’ attribute.

‘hfy-box-to-style’


          (hfy-box-to-style SPEC)

     Convert a complex ‘:box’ Emacs font attribute set to a list of CSS
     border-* attributes.  Don’t call this directly—it is called by
     *note hfy-box:: when necessary.

‘hfy-html-enkludge-buffer’


          (hfy-html-enkludge-buffer)

     Mark dangerous ‘["<>]’ characters with the ‘hfy-quoteme’ property.

     See also *note hfy-html-dekludge-buffer::.

‘hfy-buffer’


          (hfy-buffer)

     Generate and return an Htmlfontify html output buffer for the
     current buffer.  May trample an existing buffer.

‘hfy-fontified-p’


          (hfy-fontified-p)

     ‘font-lock’ doesn’t like to say a buffer’s been fontified when in
     batch mode, but we want to know if we should fontify or raw copy,
     so in batch mode we check for non-default face properties.
     Otherwise we test ‘font-lock-mode’ and ‘font-lock-fontified’ for
     truth.

‘hfy-lookup’


          (hfy-lookup FACE STYLE)

     Where STYLE is a *note hfy-sheet-assoc:: and FACE is an Emacs face,
     return the relevant CSS style name.

‘hfy-fontify-buffer’


          (hfy-fontify-buffer &optional SRCDIR FILE)

     Implement the guts of *note htmlfontify-buffer::.

‘hfy-color’


          (hfy-color COLOR)

     Convert an Emacs :foreground property to a CSS color property.

‘hfy-flatten-style’


          (hfy-flatten-style STYLE)

     Take STYLE (*note hfy-face-to-style-i::, *note hfy-face-to-style::)
     and merge any multiple attributes appropriately.  Currently only
     font-size is merged down to a single occurrence—others may need
     special handling, but I haven’t encountered them yet.  Returns a
     *note hfy-style-assoc::.

‘hfy-size-to-int’


          (hfy-size-to-int SPEC)

     Convert SPEC, a CSS font-size specifier, back to an Emacs ‘:height’
     attribute value.  Used while merging multiple font-size attributes.

‘hfy-sprintf-stylesheet’


          (hfy-sprintf-stylesheet CSS FILE)

     Generates a header, via *note hfy-page-header::, for FILE,
     containing the stylesheet derived from CSS, which is a *note
     hfy-sheet-assoc::.  Returns a string containing the same.

‘hfy-relstub’


          (hfy-relstub FILE &optional START)

     Return a ‘../’ stub of the appropriate length for the current
     source tree depth (as determined from FILE).

‘hfy-compile-face-map’


          (hfy-compile-face-map)

     Compile and return a *note hfy-facemap-assoc:: for the current
     buffer.

‘hfy-prepare-index’


          (hfy-prepare-index SRCDIR DSTDIR)

     Return as list of index buffer(s), as determined by *note
     hfy-split-index::.  Uses *note hfy-prepare-index-i:: to do this.

‘hfy-prepare-tag-map’


          (hfy-prepare-tag-map SRCDIR DSTDIR)

     Prepare the counterpart(s) to the index buffer(s)—a list of buffers
     with the same structure, but listing (and linking to) instances of
     tags (as opposed to their definitions).

     See also: *note hfy-prepare-index::, *note hfy-split-index::

‘hfy-subtract-maps’


          (hfy-subtract-maps SRCDIR)

     Internal function—strips definitions of tags from the instance map.
     See: *note hfy-tags-cache:: and *note hfy-tags-rmap::

‘hfy-face-to-style-i’


          (hfy-face-to-style-i FN)

     The guts of *note hfy-face-to-style::.  FN should be a ‘defface’
     font specification, as returned by ‘face-attr-construct’ or *note
     hfy-face-attr-for-class::.  Note that this function does not get
     font-sizes right if they are based on inherited modifiers (via the
     :inherit) attribute, and any other modifiers that are cumulative if
     they appear multiple times need to be merged by the user—*note
     hfy-flatten-style:: should do this.

‘hfy-face-to-css’


          (hfy-face-to-css FN)

     Take FN, a font or ‘defface’ specification (c.f.
     ‘face-attr-construct’) and return a CSS style specification.

     See also: *note hfy-face-to-style::

‘hfy-html-quote’


          (hfy-html-quote CHAR-STRING)

     Map a string (usually 1 character long) to an html safe string
     (entity) if need be.

‘hfy-link-style’


          (hfy-link-style STYLE-STRING)

     Convert the CSS style spec STYLE-STRING to its equivalent hyperlink
     style.

     See: *note hfy-link-style-fun::.

‘hfy-p-to-face’


          (hfy-p-to-face PROPS)

     Given PROPS, a list of text-properties, return the value of the
     face property, or ‘nil’.

‘hfy-box-to-border-assoc’


          (hfy-box-to-border-assoc SPEC)

     Helper function for *note hfy-box-to-style::.

‘hfy-face-attr-for-class’


          (hfy-face-attr-for-class FACE &optional CLASS)

     Return the face attributes for FACE.  If CLASS is set, it must be a
     ‘defface’ alist key [see below].  Prior to version 0.18, the first
     face specification returned by *note hfy-combined-face-spec:: which
     _didn’t_ clash with CLASS was returned.  In versions from 0.18
     onwards, each font attribute list is scored, and the
     non-conflicting list with the highest score is returned.  (A
     specification with a class of ‘t’ is considered to match any class
     you specify.  This matches Emacs’s behavior when deciding on which
     face attributes to use, to the best of my understanding ).

     If CLASS is ‘nil’, then you just get whatever ‘face-attr-construct’
     returns; i.e., the current specification in effect for FACE.

     See *note hfy-display-class:: for details of valid values for
     CLASS.

‘hfy-face-at’


          (hfy-face-at P)

     Find face in effect at point P.  If overlays are to be considered
     (*note hfy-optimizations::) then this may return a ‘defface’ style
     list of face properties instead of a face symbol.

‘hfy-bgcol’


          (hfy-bgcol COLOR)

     As per *note hfy-color:: but for background colors.

‘hfy-kludge-cperl-mode’


          (hfy-kludge-cperl-mode)

     cperl mode does its best to not do some of its fontification when
     not in a windowing system—we try to trick it...

‘hfy-href’


          (hfy-href THIS-FILE DEF-FILES TAG TAG-MAP)

     Return a relative href to the tag in question, based on

     THIS-FILE *note hfy-link-extn:: *note hfy-extn:: DEF-FILES TAG and
     TAG-MAP

     THIS-FILE is the current source file DEF-FILES is a list of file
     containing possible link endpoints for TAG TAG is the TAG in
     question TAG-MAP is the entry in *note hfy-tags-cache::.

‘hfy-shell’


          (hfy-shell)

     Returns a best guess at a Bourne compatible shell to use: If the
     current shell doesn’t look promising, fall back to *note
     hfy-shell-file-name::.

‘hfy-load-tags-cache’


          (hfy-load-tags-cache SRCDIR)

     Run *note hfy-etags-cmd:: on SRCDIR: load *note hfy-tags-cache::
     and *note hfy-tags-sortl::.

‘hfy-parse-tags-buffer’


          (hfy-parse-tags-buffer SRCDIR BUFFER)

     Parse a BUFFER containing etags formatted output, loading the *note
     hfy-tags-cache:: and *note hfy-tags-sortl:: entries for SRCDIR.

‘hfy-interq’


          (hfy-interq SET-A SET-B)

     Return the intersection (using ‘eq’) of 2 lists.

‘hfy-text-p’


          (hfy-text-p SRCDIR FILE)

     Is SRCDIR/FILE text?  Uses *note hfy-istext-command:: to determine
     this.

‘hfy-opt’


          (hfy-opt SYMBOL)

     Is *note hfy-optimizations:: member SYMBOL set or not?

‘hfy-dirname’


          (hfy-dirname FILE)

     Return everything preceding the last ‘/’ from a relative filename,
     on the assumption that this will produce the name of a relative
     directory.  Hardly bombproof, but good enough in the context in
     which it is being used.

‘hfy-html-dekludge-buffer’


          (hfy-html-dekludge-buffer)

     Transform all dangerous characters marked with the ‘hfy-quoteme’
     property using *note hfy-html-quote::

     See also *note hfy-html-enkludge-buffer::.

‘hfy-copy-and-fontify-file’


          (hfy-copy-and-fontify-file SRCDIR DSTDIR FILE)

     Open FILE in SRCDIR—if fontified, write a fontified copy to DSTDIR
     adding an extension of *note hfy-extn::.  Fontification is actually
     done by *note htmlfontify-buffer::.  If the buffer is not
     fontified, just copy it.

‘hfy-decor’


          (hfy-decor TAG VAL)

     Derive CSS text-decoration specifiers from various Emacs font
     attributes.

‘hfy-slant’


          (hfy-slant SLANT)

     Derive a font-style CSS specifier from the Emacs :slant
     attribute—CSS does not define the reverse-* styles, so just maps
     those to the regular specifiers.

‘hfy-tags-for-file’


          (hfy-tags-for-file SRCDIR FILE)

     List of etags tags that have definitions in this FILE.  Looks up
     the tags cache in *note hfy-tags-cache:: using SRCDIR as the key.

‘hfy-width’

# /. 2.3 Variables
=================

Important variables that are not customization items:

‘hfy-tags-cache’

     This is an alist of the form:

          (("/src/dir/0" . tag-hash0) ("/src/dir/1" tag-hash1) ... )

     Each tag hash entry then contains entries of the form:

          "tag_string" => (("file/name.ext" line char) ... )

     i.e., an alist mapping (relative) file paths to line and character
     offsets.

     See *note hfy-load-tags-cache::.

‘hfy-tags-rmap’

     ‘hfy-tags-rmap’ is an alist of the form:

          (("/src/dir" . tag-rmap-hash))

     Where tag-rmap-hash has entries of the form:

          "tag_string" => ( "file/name.ext" line char )

     Unlike *note hfy-tags-cache:: these are the locations of
     occurrences of tagged items, not the locations of their
     definitions.

‘hfy-tags-sortl’

     ‘hfy-tags-sortl’ is an alist of the form:

          (("/src/dir" . (tag0 tag1 tag2)) ... )

     Where the tags are stored in descending order of length.

     See: *note hfy-load-tags-cache::.

# /. 2.4 Data Structures
=======================

Some of the (informal) data structures used in Htmlfontify are detailed
here:

‘hfy-style-assoc’

     An assoc representing/describing an Emacs face.  Properties may be
     repeated, in which case later properties should be treated as if
     they were inherited from a “parent” font.  (For some properties,
     only the first encountered value is of any importance, for others
     the values might be cumulative, and for others they might be
     cumulative in a complex way.)

     Some examples:

          (hfy-face-to-style 'default) =>

            (("background"      . "rgb(0, 0, 0)"      )
             ("color"           . "rgb(255, 255, 255)")
             ("font-style"      . "normal"            )
             ("font-weight"     . "500"               )
             ("font-stretch"    . "normal"            )
             ("font-family"     . "misc-fixed"        )
             ("font-size"       . "13pt"              )
             ("text-decoration" . "none"              ))

          (hfy-face-to-style 'Info-title-3-face) =>

            (("font-weight"     . "700"        )
             ("font-family"     . "helv"       )
             ("font-size"       . "120%"       )
             ("text-decoration" . "none")      )

‘hfy-sheet-assoc’

     An assoc with elements of the form ‘(face-name style-name .
     style-string)’.  The actual stylesheet for each page is derived
     from one of these.

          ((default       "default" . "{ background: black; color: white}")
           (font-lock-string-face "string"  . "{ color: rgb(64,224,208) }"))

‘hfy-facemap-assoc’

     An assoc of ‘(point . FACE-SYMBOL)’ or ‘(point . defface attribute
     list)’ and ‘(point . end)’ elements, in descending order of point
     value (i.e., from the file’s end to its beginning).  The map is in
     reverse order because inserting a ‘<style>’ tag (or any other
     string) at POINT invalidates the map for all entries with a greater
     value of point.  By traversing the map from greatest to least
     POINT, we still invalidate the map as we go, but only those points
     we have already dealt with (and therefore no longer care about)
     will be invalid at any time.

          ((64820 . end)
           (64744 . font-lock-comment-face)
           (64736 . end)
           (64722 . font-lock-string-face)
           (64630 . end)
           (64623 . font-lock-string-face)
           (64449 . end)
           ;; Big similar section elided.  You get the idea.
           (5459 . end)
           (5431 . (:inherit font-lock-keyword-face :background "7e7e7e"))
           (5431 . end)
           (4285 . font-lock-constant-face)
           (4285 . end)
           (4221 . font-lock-comment-face)
           (4221 . end)
           (4197 . font-lock-constant-face)
           (4197 . end)
           (1 . font-lock-comment-face))

# /. 2.5 Examples
================

The following is a lump of code I use to fontify source code on my site,
<http://rtfm.etla.org/> (which was the reason, incidentally, that
Htmlfontify was written in the first place).

     (defvar rtfm-section nil)

     ;; Constructs an appropriate header string to fit in with rtfm's
     ;; templating system, based on the file and the stylesheet string

     ;; Here's the function I actually call---it asks me for a section label,

# /. 3 Customization
*******************

Htmlfontify provides the following variable and customization entries:

‘hfy-link-style-fun’

     Set this to a function, which will be called with one argument (a
     ‘{ foo: bar; ...}’ CSS style-string)—it should return a copy of its
     argument, altered so as to make any changes you want made for text
     which is a hyperlink, in addition to being in the class to which
     that style would normally be applied.

‘hfy-html-quote-regex’

     Regex to match (with a single back-reference per match) strings in
     HTML which should be quoted with *note hfy-html-quote:: (and *note
     hfy-html-quote-map::) to make them safe.

‘hfy-page-footer’

     As *note hfy-page-header::, but generates the output footer (and
     takes only 1 argument, the filename).

‘hfy-display-class’

     Display class to use to determine which display class to use when
     calculating a face’s attributes.  This is useful when, for example,
     you are running Emacs on a tty or in batch mode, and want
     Htmlfontify to have access to the face spec you would use if you
     were connected to an X display.

     Some valid class specification elements are:

            (class      color)
            (class      grayscale)
            (background dark)
            (background light)
            (type       x-toolkit)
            (type       tty)
            (type       motif)
            (type       lucid)

     Multiple values for a tag may be combined, to indicate that any one
     or more of these values in the specification key constitutes a
     match.  For example, ‘((class color grayscale) (type tty))’ would
     match any of:

            ((class color))
            ((class grayscale))
            ((class color grayscale)))
            ((class color foo))
            ((type  tty))
            ((type  tty) (class color))

‘hfy-page-header’

     Function called with two arguments (the filename relative to the
     top level source directory being etagged and fontified), and a
     string containing the ‘<style>...</style>’ text to embed in the
     document—the string returned will be used as the header for the
     htmlfontified version of the source file.

     See also: *note hfy-page-footer::

‘hfy-src-doc-link-style’

     String to add to the ‘<style> a’ variant of an Htmlfontify CSS
     class.

‘hfy-split-index’

     Whether or not to split the index *note hfy-index-file::
     alphabetically on the first letter of each tag.  Useful when the
     index would otherwise be large and take a long time to render or be
     difficult to navigate.

‘hfy-exclude-file-rules’

     Regular expressions to exclude files which shouldn’t be fontified.

‘hfy-extn’

     File extension used for output files.

‘hfy-default-face-def’

     Fallback ‘defface’ specification for the face ‘default’, used when
     *note hfy-display-class:: has been set (the normal Htmlfontify way
     of extracting potentially non-current face information doesn’t
     necessarily work for ‘default’).

     For example, I customize this to:

          ((t :background "black" :foreground "white" :family "misc-fixed"))

‘hfy-init-kludge-hook’

     List of functions to call when starting htmlfontify-buffer to do
     any kludging necessary to get highlighting modes to behave as you
     want, even when not running under a window system.

‘hfy-shell-file-name’

     Should be set to a Bourne compatible shell, which will be invoked
     for the more complex shell interactions needed by Htmlfontify.
     Currently this is only required/used when using GNU etags, see
     *note hfy-etags-cmd-alist:: for details.

‘hfy-optimizations’

     Optimizations to turn on.  So far, the following have been
     implemented:

     ‘merge-adjacent-tags’
          If two (or more) span tags are adjacent, identical and
          separated by nothing more than whitespace, they will be merged
          into one span.

     ‘zap-comment-links’
          Suppress hyperlinking of tags found in comments.

     ‘zap-string-links’
          Suppress hyperlinking of tags found in strings.

     ‘div-wrapper’
          Add ‘<div class="default"> </div>’ tags around the fontified
          body.  (Some people like this because they cut and paste the
          html into a page with different colors than the fontified
          code.)

     ‘keep-overlays’
          Preserve overlay highlighting (cf. ‘ediff’ or ‘goo-font-lock’)
          as well as basic faces.  Can result in extremely verbose
          highlighting if there are many overlays (as is the case with
          ‘goo-font-lock’).

     And the following are planned but not yet available:

     ‘kill-context-leak’
          Suppress hyperlinking between files highlighted by different
          modes.

     Note: like compiler optimizations, these optimize the _output_ of
     the code, not the processing of the source itself, and are
     therefore likely to slow Htmlfontify down, at least a little.
     Except for skip-refontification, which can never slow you down, but
     may result in incomplete fontification.

‘hfy-src-doc-link-unstyle’

     Regex to remove from the ‘<style> a’ variant of an Htmlfontify CSS
     class.

‘hfy-link-extn’

     File extension used for href links—useful where the Htmlfontify
     output files are going to be processed again, with a resulting
     change in file extension.  If ‘nil’, then any code using this
     should fall back to *note hfy-extn::.

‘hfy-istext-command’

     Command to run with the name of a file, to see whether it is a text
     file or not.  The command should emit a string containing the word
     ‘text’ if the file is a text file, and a string not containing
     ‘text’ otherwise.

‘hfy-etags-cmd-alist’

     An alist of possible shell commands that will generate etags output
     that Htmlfontify can use.  ‘%s’ will be replaced by *note
     hfy-etags-bin::.

‘hfy-etags-bin’

     The location of the etags binary (we begin by assuming it’s in your
     path).

     Note that if etags is not in your path, you will need to alter the
     shell commands in *note hfy-etags-cmd-alist::.

     [As of version 0.17, this requirement has been removed: it should
     all just work(tm).]

‘hfy-etags-cmd’

     An etags shell command to run in the source directory to generate a
     tags file for the whole source tree from there on down.  The
     command should emit the etags output on standard output.

     Two canned commands are provided—they drive Emacs’s etags and
     exuberant-ctags’s etags respectively.

‘hfy-etag-regex’

     Regex used to parse an etags entry: must have 3 subexps,
     corresponding, in order, to:

       1. The tag
       2. The line
       3. The character (point) at which the tag occurs

‘hfy-index-file’

     Name (sans extension) of the index file produced during
     fontification-and-hyperlinking.

‘hfy-instance-file’

     Name (sans extension) of the tag usage index file produced during
     fontification-and-hyperlinking.

‘hfy-html-quote-map’

     An alist of character -> entity mappings used to make the text
     html-safe.

# /. 4 Requirements
******************

Htmlfontify has a couple of external requirements:

   • A copy of etags (exuberant-ctags or GNU etags).  Htmlfontify
     attempts to autodetect the version you have and customize itself
     accordingly, but you should be able to override this.

     See: *note Customization::

   • A copy of sed (e.g., GNU sed).

   • A copy of the ‘file’ command.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

# /. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
