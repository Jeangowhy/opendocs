   COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE  
   By A. M. Turing  

1 The Imitation Game
=====================

   I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
   definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
   framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
   dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
   examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
   meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
   statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a
   definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is
   expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

   The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
   'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an
   interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the
   other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other
   two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the
   end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The
   interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:

   C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?

   Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and
   cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:

   "My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long."

   In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written,
   or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating
   between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an
   intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator.
   The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as
   "I am the woman, don't listen to him!" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man
   can make similar remarks.

   We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this
   game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as
   he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace
   our original, "Can machines think?"

2 Critique of the New Problem
==============================

   As well as asking, "What is the answer to this new form of the question," one may ask,
   "Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?" This latter question we investigate
   without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress.

   The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical
   and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to
   produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at
   some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel
   there was little point in trying to make a "thinking machine" more human by dressing it
   up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in
   the condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other
   competitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion
   may be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus:

   Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.  
   A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.  
   Q: Add 34957 to 70764.  
   A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.  
   Q: Do you play chess?  
   A: Yes.  
   Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. 
      It is your move. What do you play?  
   A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.  

   The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of
   the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include. We do not wish to penalise the
   machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing
   in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities
   irrelevant. The "witnesses" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please
   about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical
   demonstrations.

   The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily
   against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would
   clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and
   inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be
   described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is
   a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be
   constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this
   objection.

   It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" the best strategy for the
   machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This
   may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case
   there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that
   the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man.

3 The Machines Concerned in the Game
=====================================

   The question which we put in 1 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we
   mean by the word "machine." It is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of
   engineering technique to be used in our machines. We also wish to allow the possibility
   than an engineer or team of engineers may construct a machine which works, but whose
   manner of operation cannot be satisfactorily described by its constructors because they
   have applied a method which is largely experimental. Finally, we wish to exclude from
   the machines men born in the usual manner. It is difficult to frame the definitions so as to
   satisfy these three conditions. One might for instance insist that the team of engineers
   should be all of one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably
   possible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a man. To do
   so would be a feat of biological technique deserving of the very highest praise, but we
   would not be inclined to regard it as a case of "constructing a thinking machine." This
   prompts us to abandon the requirement that every kind of technique should be permitted.
   We are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in "thinking
   machines" has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an "electronic
   computer" or "digital computer." Following this suggestion we only permit digital
   computers to take part in our game.

   This restriction appears at first sight to be a very drastic one. I shall attempt to show that
   it is not so in reality. To do this necessitates a short account of the nature and properties
   of these computers.

   It may also be said that this identification of machines with digital computers, like our
   criterion for "thinking," will only be unsatisfactory if (contrary to my belief), it turns out
   that digital computers are unable to give a good showing in the game.

   There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked,
   "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of
   the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how
   often the right identification was given." The short answer is that we are not asking
   whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers at
   present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which
   would do well. But this is only the short answer. We shall see this question in a different
   light later.

4 Digital Computers
====================

   The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are
   intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer. The
   human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate
   from them in any detail. We may suppose that these rules are supplied in a book, which is
   altered whenever he is put on to a new job. He has also an unlimited supply of paper on
   which he does his calculations. He may also do his multiplications and additions on a
   "desk machine," but this is not important.

   If we use the above explanation as a definition we shall be in danger of circularity of
   argument. We avoid this by giving an outline. of the means by which the desired effect is
   achieved. A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts:

   (i) Store.

   (ii) Executive unit.

   (iii) Control.

   The store is a store of information, and corresponds to the human computer's paper,
   whether this is the paper on which he does his calculations or that on which his book of
   rules is printed. In so far as the human computer does calculations in his bead a part of
   the store will correspond to his memory.

   The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved
   in a calculation. What these individual operations are will vary from machine to machine.
   Usually fairly lengthy operations can be done such as "Multiply 3540675445 by
   7076345687" but in some machines only very simple ones such as "Write down 0" are
   possible.

   We have mentioned that the "book of rules" supplied to the computer is replaced in the
   machine by a part of the store. It is then called the "table of instructions." It is the duty of
   the control to see that these instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. The
   control is so constructed that this necessarily happens.

   The information in the store is usually broken up into packets of moderately small size. In
   one machine, for instance, a packet might consist of ten decimal digits. Numbers are
   assigned to the parts of the store in which the various packets of information are stored,
   in some systematic manner. A typical instruction might say-

   "Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the
   latter storage position."

   Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more
   likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible
   operations is to be performed on the two numbers. In this case the)e operation is that
   described above, viz., "Add the number. . . ." It will be noticed that the instruction takes
   up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information, very conveniently. The control will
   normally take the instructions to be obeyed in the order of the positions in which they are
   stored, but occasionally an instruction such as

   "Now obey the instruction stored in position 5606, and continue from there"

   may be encountered, or again

   "If position 4505 contains 0 obey next the instruction stored in 6707, otherwise continue
   straight on."

   Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it possible for a
   sequence of operations to be replaced over and over again until some condition is
   fulfilled, but in doing so to obey, not fresh instructions on each repetition, but the same
   ones over and over again. To take a domestic analogy. Suppose Mother wants Tommy to
   call at the cobbler's every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she
   can ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice once and for all
   in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school and which tells him to call for the
   shoes, and also to destroy the notice when he comes back if he has the shoes with him.

   The reader must accept it as a fact that digital computers can be constructed, and indeed
   have been constructed, according to the principles we have described, and that they can in
   fact mimic the actions of a human computer very closely.

   The book of rules which we have described our human computer as using is of course a
   convenient fiction. Actual human computers really remember what they have got to do. If
   one wants to make a machine mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some
   complex operation one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into
   the form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually described as
   "programming." To "programme a machine to carry out the operation A" means to put
   the appropriate instruction table into the machine so that it will do A.

   An interesting variant on the idea of a digital computer is a "digital computer with a
   random element." These have instructions involving the throwing of a die or some
   equivalent electronic process; one such instruction might for instance be, "Throw the die
   and put the-resulting number into store 1000." Sometimes such a machine is described as
   having free will (though I would not use this phrase myself), It is not normally possible to
   determine from observing a machine whether it has a random element, for a similar effect
   can be produced by such devices as making the choices depend on the digits of the
   decimal for .

   Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no theoretical difficulty in
   the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been
   used at any one time. Likewise only a finite amount can have been constructed, but we
   can imagine more and more being added as required. Such computers have special
   theoretical interest and will be called infinitive capacity computers.

   The idea of a digital computer is an old one. Charles Babbage, Lucasian Professor of
   Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839, planned such a machine, called the
   Analytical Engine, but it was never completed. Although Babbage had all the essential
   ideas, his machine was not at that time such a very attractive prospect. The speed which
   would have been available would be definitely faster than a human computer but
   something like I 00 times slower than the Manchester machine, itself one of the slower of
   the modern machines, The storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards.

   The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical will help us to
   rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital
   computers are electrical, and that the nervous system also is electrical. Since Babbage's
   machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we
   see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. Of course electricity
   usually comes in where fast signalling is concerned, so that it is not surprising that we
   find it in both these connections. In the nervous system chemical phenomena are at least
   as important as electrical. In certain computers the storage system is mainly acoustic. The
   feature of using electricity is thus seen to be only a very superficial similarity. If we wish
   to find such similarities we should took rather for mathematical analogies of function.

5 Universality of Digital Computers
====================================

   The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the
   "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks
   from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the
   possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking there, are no such
   machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine
   which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in
   considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch
   must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most
   purposes we can forget about them. As an example of a discrete-state machine we might
   consider a wheel which clicks round through 120 once a second, but may be stopped by a
   ]ever which can be operated from outside; in addition a lamp is to light in one of the
   positions of the wheel. This machine could be described abstractly as follows. The
   internal state of the machine (which is described by the position of the wheel) may be q1,
   q2 or q3. There is an input signal i0. or i1 (position of ]ever). The internal state at any
   moment is determined by the last state and input signal according to the table

   | Input   | Last State              |
   | ------- | ----------------------- |
   | $ i_0 $ | $ q_1 $ $ q_2 $ $ q_3 $ |
   | $ i_1 $ | $ o_0 $ $ o_0 $ $ o_1 $ |

   The output signals, the only externally visible indication of the internal state (the light)
   are described by the table

   State  $ q_1 $ $ q_2 $ $ q_3 $  
   output $ o_0 $ $ o_0 $ $ o_1 $  

   This example is typical of discrete-state machines. They can be described by such tables
   provided they have only a finite number of possible states.

   It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always
   possible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the
   complete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and
   velocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction
   which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered
   by Laplace. The system of the "universe as a whole" is such that quite small errors in the
   initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a
   single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference
   between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential
   property of the mechanical systems which we have called "discrete-state machines" that
   this phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines
   instead of the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one
   moment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps later.

   As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines.
   But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large.
   For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about $ 2^{165,000} $,
   i.e., about $ 10^{50,000} $. Compare this with our example of the clicking wheel described
   above, which had three states. It is not difficult to see why the number of states should be
   so immense. The computer includes a store corresponding to the paper used by a human
   computer. It must be possible to write into the store any one of the combinations of
   symbols which might have been written on the paper. For simplicity suppose that only
   digits from 0 to 9 are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose
   the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for
   30 digits. Then the number of states is $ 10^{100x50x30} $ i.e., $ 10^{150,000} $. This is about 
   the number of states of three Manchester machines put together. The logarithm to the base two 
   of the number of states is usually called the "storage capacity" of the machine. Thus the
   Manchester machine has a storage capacity of about 165,000 and the wheel machine of
   our example about 1.6. If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to
   obtain the capacity of the resultant machine. This leads to the possibility of statements
   such as "The Manchester machine contains 64 magnetic tracks each with a capacity of
   2560, eight electronic tubes with a capacity of 1280. Miscellaneous storage amounts to
   about 300 making a total of 174,380."

   Given the table corresponding to a discrete-state machine it is possible to predict what it
   will do. There is no reason why this calculation should not be carried out by means of a
   digital computer. Provided it could be carried out sufficiently quickly the digital
   computer could mimic the behavior of any discrete-state machine. The imitation game
   could then be played with the machine in question (as B) and the mimicking digital
   computer (as A) and the interrogator would be unable to distinguish them. Of course the
   digital computer must have an adequate storage capacity as well as working sufficiently
   fast. Moreover, it must be programmed afresh for each new machine which it is desired
   to mimic.

   This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete-state
   machine, is described by saying that they are universal machines. The existence of
   machines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed
   apart, it is unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing
   processes. They can all be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each
   case. It 'ill be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in a sense
   equivalent.

   We may now consider again the point raised at the end of §3. It was suggested tentatively
   that the question, "Can machines think?" should be replaced by "Are there imaginable
   digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" If we wish we can make
   this superficially more general and ask "Are there discrete-state machines which would
   do well?" But in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is
   equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true
   that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed
   of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play
   satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"

6 Contrary Views on the Main Question
======================================

   We may now consider the ground to have been cleared and we are ready to proceed to the
   debate on our question, "Can machines think?" and the variant of it quoted at the end of
   the last section. We cannot altogether abandon the original form of the problem, for
   opinions will differ as to the appropriateness of the substitution and we must at least
   listen to what has to be said in this connexion.

   It will simplify matters for the reader if I explain first my own beliefs in the matter.
   Consider first the more accurate form of the question. I believe that in about fifty years'
   time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to
   make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have
   more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of
   questioning. The original question, "Can machines think?" I believe to be too
   meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century
   the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be
   able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further
   that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that
   scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never
   being influenced by any improved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is made clear
   which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no harm can result. Conjectures are of
   great importance since they suggest useful lines of research.

   I now proceed to consider opinions opposed to my own.

(1) The Theological Objection
-----------------------------

   Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every
   man and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or
   machine can think.

   I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in theological terms. I
   should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is
   a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than
   there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view
   becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious
   community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? But
   let us leave this point aside and return to the main argument. It appears to me that the
   argument quoted above implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty.
   It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to
   two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He
   sees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a
   mutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to
   the needs of this sort[. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of
   machines. It may seem different because it is more difficult to "swallow." But this really
   only means that we think it would be less likely that He would consider the
   circumstances suitable for conferring a soul. The circumstances in question are discussed
   in the rest of this paper. In attempting to construct such machines we should not be
   irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the
   procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing
   mansions for the souls that He creates.

   However, this is mere speculation. I am not very impressed with theological arguments
   whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found
   unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, "And the sun
   stood still ... and hasted not to go down about a whole day" (Joshua x. 13) and "He laid
   the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time" (Psalm cv. 5) were an
   adequate refutation of the Copernican theory. With our present knowledge such an
   argument appears futile. When that knowledge was not available it made a quite different
   impression.

(2) The "Heads in the Sand" Objection
-------------------------------------

   The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe
   that they cannot do so."

   This argument is seldom expressed quite so openly as in the form above. But it affects
   most of us who think about it at all. We like to believe that Man is in some subtle way
   superior to the rest of creation. It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for
   then there is no danger of him losing his commanding position. The popularity of the
   theological argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be quite strong
   in intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking more highly than others, and
   are more inclined to base their belief in the superiority of Man on this power.

   I do not think that this argument is sufficiently substantial to require refutation.
   Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be sought in the
   transmigration of souls.

(3) The Mathematical Objection
------------------------------

   There are a number of results of mathematical logic which can be used to show that there
   are limitations to the powers of discrete-state machines. The best known of these results
   is known as Godel's theorem ( 1931 ) and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical
   system statements can be formulated which can neither be proved nor disproved within
   the system, unless possibly the system itself is inconsistent. There are other, in some
   respects similar, results due to Church (1936), Kleene (1935), Rosser, and Turing (1937).
   The latter result is the most convenient to consider, since it refers directly to machines,
   whereas the others can only be used in a comparatively indirect argument: for instance if
   Godel's theorem is to be used we need in addition to have some means of describing
   logical systems in terms of machines, and machines in terms of logical systems. The
   result in question refers to a type of machine which is essentially a digital computer with
   an infinite capacity. It states that there are certain things that such a machine cannot do. If
   it is rigged up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game, there will be some
   questions to which it will either give a wrong answer, or fail to give an answer at all
   however much time is allowed for a reply. There may, of course, be many such questions,
   and questions which cannot be answered by one machine may be satisfactorily answered
   by another. We are of course supposing for the present that the questions are of the kind
   to which an answer "Yes" or "No" is appropriate, rather than questions such as "What do
   you think of Picasso?" The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this
   type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes'
   to any question?" The dots are to be replaced by a description of some machine in a
   standard form, which could be something like that used in §5. When the machine
   described bears a certain comparatively simple relation to the machine which is under
   interrogation, it can be shown that the answer is either wrong or not forthcoming. This is
   the mathematical result: it is argued that it proves a disability of machines to which the
   human intellect is not subject.

   The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are
   limitations to the Powers If any particular machine, it has only been stated, without any
   sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not think this
   view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the
   appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must
   be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory? It is no
   doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much importance should be attached to it. We
   too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased
   at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines. Further, our superiority can
   only be felt on such an occasion in relation to the one machine over which we have
   scored our petty triumph. There would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over
   all machines. In short, then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but
   then again there might be other machines cleverer again, and so on.

   Those who hold to the mathematical argument would, I think, mostly he willing to accept
   the imitation game as a basis for discussion, Those who believe in the two previous
   objections would probably not be interested in any criteria.

(4) The Argument from Consciousness
-----------------------------------

   This argument is very, well expressed in Professor Jefferson's Lister Oration for 1949,
   from which I quote. "Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto
   because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we
   agree that machine equals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it.
   No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance)
   pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made
   miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get
   what it wants."

   This argument appears to be a denial of the validity of our test. According to the most
   extreme form of this view the only way by which one could be sure that machine thinks
   is to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking. One could then describe these feelings
   to the world, but of course no one would be justified in taking any notice. Likewise
   according to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular
   man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view. It may be the most logical view to hold but it
   makes communication of ideas difficult. A is liable to believe "A thinks but B does not"
   whilst B believes "B thinks but A does not." instead of arguing continually over this point
   it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.

   I am sure that Professor Jefferson does not wish to adopt the extreme and solipsist point
   of view. Probably he would be quite willing to accept the imitation game as a test. The
   game (with the player B omitted) is frequently used in practice under the name of viva
   voce to discover whether some one really understands something or has "learnt it parrot
   fashion." Let us listen in to a part of such a viva voce:

   Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a
   summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better?

   Witness: It wouldn't scan.

   Interrogator: How about "a winter's day," That would scan all right.

   Witness: Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day.

   Interrogator: Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?

   Witness: In a way.

   Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick would
   mind the comparison.

   Witness: I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a typical winter's day,
   rather than a special one like Christmas.

   And so on, What would Professor Jefferson say if the sonnet-writing machine was able to
   answer like this in the viva voce? I do not know whether he would regard the machine as
   "merely artificially signalling" these answers, but if the answers were as satisfactory and
   sustained as in the above passage I do not think he would describe it as "an easy
   contrivance." This phrase is, I think, intended to cover such devices as the inclusion in
   the machine of a record of someone reading a sonnet, with appropriate switching to turn
   it on from time to time.

   In short then, I think that most of those who support the argument from consciousness
   could be persuaded to abandon it rather than be forced into the solipsist position. They
   will then probably be willing to accept our test.

   I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness.
   There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it.
   But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the
   question with which we are concerned in this paper.

(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities
---------------------------------------

   These arguments take the form, "I grant you that you can make machines do all the things
   you have mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X." Numerous features
   X are suggested in this connexion I offer a selection:

   Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right
   from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make some one
   fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own
   thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.

   No support is usually offered for these statements. I believe they are mostly founded on
   the principle of scientific induction. A man has seen thousands of machines in his
   lifetime. From what he sees of them he draws a number of general conclusions. They are
   ugly, each is designed for a very limited purpose, when required for a minutely different
   purpose they are useless, the variety of behaviour of any one of them is very small, etc.,
   etc. Naturally he concludes that these are necessary properties of machines in general.
   Many of these limitations are associated with the very small storage capacity of most
   machines. (I am assuming that the idea of storage capacity is extended in some way to
   cover machines other than discrete-state machines. The exact definition does not matter
   as no mathematical accuracy is claimed in the present discussion,) A few years ago, when
   very little had been heard of digital computers, it was possible to elicit much incredulity
   concerning them, if one mentioned their properties without describing their construction.
   That was presumably due to a similar application of the principle of scientific induction.
   These applications of the principle are of course largely unconscious. When a burnt child
   fears the fire and shows that he fears it by avoiding it, f should say that he was applying
   scientific induction. (I could of course also describe his behaviour in many other ways.)
   The works and customs of mankind do not seem to be very suitable material to which to
   apply scientific induction. A very large part of space-time must be investigated, if reliable
   results are to be obtained. Otherwise we may (as most English 'Children do) decide that
   everybody speaks English, and that it is silly to learn French.

   There are, however, special remarks to be made about many of the disabilities that have
   been mentioned. The inability to enjoy strawberries and cream may have struck the
   reader as frivolous. Possibly a machine might be made to enjoy this delicious dish, but
   any attempt to make one do so would be idiotic. What is important about this disability is
   that it contributes to some of the other disabilities, e.g., to the difficulty of the same kind
   of friendliness occurring between man and machine as between white man and white
   man, or between black man and black man.

   The claim that "machines cannot make mistakes" seems a curious one. One is tempted to
   retort, "Are they any the worse for that?" But let us adopt a more sympathetic attitude,
   and try to see what is really meant. I think this criticism can be explained in terms of the
   imitation game. It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the
   man simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be
   unmasked because of its deadly accuracy. The reply to this is simple. The machine
   (programmed for playing the game) would not attempt to give the right answers to the
   arithmetic problems. It would deliberately introduce mistakes in a manner calculated to
   confuse the interrogator. A mechanical fault would probably show itself through an
   unsuitable decision as to what sort of a mistake to make in the arithmetic. Even this
   interpretation of the criticism is not sufficiently sympathetic. But we cannot afford the
   space to go into it much further. It seems to me that this criticism depends on a confusion
   between two kinds of mistake, We may call them "errors of functioning" and "errors of
   conclusion." Errors of functioning are due to some mechanical or electrical fault which
   causes the machine to behave otherwise than it was designed to do. In philosophical
   discussions one likes to ignore the possibility of such errors; one is therefore discussing
   "abstract machines." These abstract machines are mathematical fictions rather than
   physical objects. By definition they are incapable of errors of functioning. In this sense
   we can truly say that "machines can never make mistakes." Errors of conclusion can only
   arise when some meaning is attached to the output signals from the machine. The
   machine might, for instance, type out mathematical equations, or sentences in English.
   When a false proposition is typed we say that the machine has committed an error of
   conclusion. There is clearly no reason at all for saying that a machine cannot make this
   kind of mistake. It might do nothing but type out repeatedly "O = I." To take a less
   perverse example, it might have some method for drawing conclusions by scientific
   induction. We must expect such a method to lead occasionally to erroneous results.

   The claim that a machine cannot be the subject of its own thought can of course only be
   answered if it can be shown that the machine has some thought with some subject matter.
   Nevertheless, "the subject matter of a machine's operations" does seem to mean
   something, at least to the people who deal with it. If, for instance, the machine was trying
   to find a solution of the equation x2 - 40x - 11 = 0 one would be tempted to describe this
   equation as part of the machine's subject matter at that moment. In this sort of sense a
   machine undoubtedly can be its own subject matter. It may be used to help in making up
   its own programmes, or to predict the effect of alterations in its own structure. By
   observing the results of its own behaviour it can modify its own programmes so as to
   achieve some purpose more effectively. These are possibilities of the near future, rather
   than Utopian dreams.

   The criticism that a machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour is just a way of
   saying that it cannot have much storage capacity. Until fairly recently a storage capacity
   of even a thousand digits was very rare.

   The criticisms that we are considering here are often disguised forms of the argument
   from consciousness, Usually if one maintains that a machine can do one of these things,
   and describes the kind of method that the machine could use, one will not make much of
   an impression. It is thought that tile method (whatever it may be, for it must be
   mechanical) is really rather base. Compare the parentheses in Jefferson's statement
   quoted on page 22.

(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection
-----------------------------

   Our most detailed information of Babbage's Analytical Engine comes from a memoir by
   Lady Lovelace ( 1842). In it she states, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to
   originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform" (her italics).
   This statement is quoted by Hartree ( 1949) who adds: "This does not imply that it may
   not be possible to construct electronic equipment which will 'think for itself,' or in which,
   in biological terms, one could set up a conditioned reflex, which would serve as a basis
   for 'learning.' Whether this is possible in principle or not is a stimulating and exciting
   question, suggested by some of these recent developments But it did not seem that the
   machines constructed or projected at the time had this property."

   I am in thorough agreement with Hartree over this. It will be noticed that he does not
   assert that the machines in question had not got the property, but rather that the evidence
   available to Lady Lovelace did not encourage her to believe that they had it. It is quite
   possible that the machines in question had in a sense got this property. For suppose that
   some discrete-state machine has the property. The Analytical Engine was a universal
   digital computer, so that, if its storage capacity and speed were adequate, it could by
   suitable programming be made to mimic the machine in question. Probably this argument
   did not occur to the Countess or to Babbage. In any case there was no obligation on them
   to claim all that could be claimed.

   This whole question will be considered again under the heading of learning machines.

   A variant of Lady Lovelace's objection states that a machine can "never do anything
   really new." This may be parried for a moment with the saw, "There is nothing new under
   the sun." Who can be certain that "original work" that he has done was not simply the
   growth of the seed planted in him by teaching, or the effect of following well-known
   general principles. A better variant of the objection says that a machine can never "take
   us by surprise." This statement is a more direct challenge and can be met directly.
   Machines take me by surprise with great frequency. This is largely because I do not do
   sufficient calculation to decide what to expect them to do, or rather because, although I
   do a calculation, I do it in a hurried, slipshod fashion, taking risks. Perhaps I say to
   myself, "I suppose the Voltage here ought to he the same as there: anyway let's assume it
   is." Naturally I am often wrong, and the result is a surprise for me for by the time the
   experiment is done these assumptions have been forgotten. These admissions lay me
   open to lectures on the subject of my vicious ways, but do not throw any doubt on my
   credibility when I testify to the surprises I experience.

   I do not expect this reply to silence my critic. He will probably say that h surprises are
   due to some creative mental act on my part, and reflect no credit on the machine. This
   leads us back to the argument from consciousness, and far from the idea of surprise. It is
   a line of argument we must consider closed, but it is perhaps worth remarking that the
   appreciation of something as surprising requires as much of a "creative mental act"
   whether the surprising event originates from a man, a book, a machine or anything else.

   The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to
   which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption
   that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that fact spring into the
   mind simultaneously with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances,
   but one too easily forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is that one
   then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working out of consequences from data
   and general principles.

(7) Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System
--------------------------------------------------

   The nervous system is certainly not a discrete-state machine. A small error in the
   information about the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron, may make a large
   difference to the size of the outgoing impulse. It may be argued that, this being so, one
   cannot expect to be able to mimic the behaviour of the nervous system with a discretestate system.
   It is true that a discrete-state machine must be different from a continuous machine. But if
   we adhere to the conditions of the imitation game, the interrogator will not be able to take
   any advantage of this difference. The situation can be made clearer if we consider sonic
   other simpler continuous machine. A differential analyser will do very well. (A
   differential analyser is a certain kind of machine not of the discrete-state type used for
   some kinds of calculation.) Some of these provide their answers in a typed form, and so
   are suitable for taking part in the game. It would not be possible for a digital computer to
   predict exactly what answers the differential analyser would give to a problem, but it
   would be quite capable of giving the right sort of answer. For instance, if asked to give
   the value of (actually about 3.1416) it would be reasonable to choose at random between
   the values 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 with the probabilities of 0.05, 0.15, 0.55, 0.19, 0.06
   (say). Under these circumstances it would be very difficult for the interrogator to
   distinguish the differential analyser from the digital computer.

(8) The Argument from Informality of Behaviour
----------------------------------------------

   It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in
   every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to
   stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by
   some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop. But
   some further difficulty may well arise from this decision later. To attempt to provide
   rules of conduct to cover every eventuality, even those arising from traffic lights, appears
   to be impossible. With all this I agree.

   From this it is argued that we cannot be machines. I shall try to reproduce the argument,
   but I fear I shall hardly do it justice. It seems to run something like this. "if each man had
   a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than
   a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines." The undistributed
   middle is glaring. I do not think the argument is ever put quite like this, but I believe this
   is the argument used nevertheless. There may however be a certain confusion between
   "rules of conduct" and "laws of behaviour" to cloud the issue. By "rules of conduct" I
   mean precepts such as "Stop if you see red lights," on which one can act, and of which
   one can be conscious. By "laws of behaviour" I mean laws of nature as applied to a man's
   body such as "if you pinch him he will squeak." If we substitute "laws of behaviour
   which regulate his life" for "laws of conduct by which he regulates his life" in the
   argument quoted the undistributed middle is no longer insuperable. For we believe that it
   is not only true that being regulated by laws of behaviour implies being some sort of
   machine (though not necessarily a discrete-state machine), but that conversely being such
   a machine implies being regulated by such laws. However, we cannot so easily convince
   ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour as of complete rules of conduct.
   The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we
   certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, "We have searched
   enough. There are no such laws."

   We can demonstrate more forcibly that any such statement would be unjustified. For
   suppose we could be sure of finding such laws if they existed. Then given a discrete-state
   machine it should certainly be possible to discover by observation sufficient about it to
   predict its future behaviour, and this within a reasonable time, say a thousand years. But
   this does not seem to be the case. I have set up on the Manchester computer a small
   programme using only 1,000 units of storage, whereby the machine supplied with one
   sixteen-figure number replies with another within two seconds. I would defy anyone to
   learn from these replies sufficient about the programme to be able to predict any replies
   to untried values.

(9) The Argument from Extrasensory Perception
---------------------------------------------

   I assume that the reader is familiar with the idea of extrasensory perception, and the
   meaning of the four items of it, viz., telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
   psychokinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas.
   How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the statistical evidence, at least for
   telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these
   new facts in. Once one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in
   ghosts and bogies. The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of
   physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar, would be
   one of the first to go.

   This argument is to my mind quite a strong one. One can say in reply that many scientific
   theories seem to remain workable in practice, in spite of clashing with ESP; that in fact
   one can get along very nicely if one forgets about it. This is rather cold comfort, and one
   fears that thinking is just the kind of phenomenon where ESP may be especially relevant.

   A more specific argument based on ESP might run as follows: "Let us play the imitation
   game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a telepathic receiver, and a digital
   computer. The interrogator can ask such questions as 'What suit does the card in my right
   hand belong to?' The man by telepathy or clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times
   out of 400 cards. The machine can only guess at random, and perhaps gets 104 right, so
   the interrogator makes the right identification." There is an interesting possibility which
   opens here. Suppose the digital computer contains a random number generator. Then it
   will be natural to use this to decide what answer to give. But then the random number
   generator will be subject to the psychokinetic powers of the interrogator. Perhaps this
   psychokinesis might cause the machine to guess right more often than would be expected
   on a probability calculation, so that the interrogator might still be unable to make the
   right identification. On the other hand, he might be able to guess right without any
   questioning, by clairvoyance. With ESP anything may happen.

   If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up. The situation could be
   regarded as analogous to that which would occur if the interrogator were talking to
   himself and one of the competitors was listening with his ear to the wall. To put the
   competitors into a "telepathy-proof room" would satisfy all requirements.

7 Learning Machines
====================

   The reader will have anticipated that I have no very convincing arguments of a positive
   nature to support my views. If I had I should not have taken such pains to point out the
   fallacies in contrary views. Such evidence as I have I shall now give.

   Let us return for a moment to Lady Lovelace's objection, which stated that the machine
   can only do what we tell it to do. One could say that a man can "inject" an idea into the
   machine, and that it will respond to a certain extent and then drop into quiescence, like a
   piano string struck by a hammer. Another simile would be an atomic pile of less than
   critical size: an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from without.
   Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. If,
   however, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, tire disturbance caused by such an
   incoming neutron will very likely go on and on increasing until the whole pile is
   destroyed. Is there a corresponding phenomenon for minds, and is there one for
   machines? There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to
   be "subcritical," i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of subcritical size. An idea
   presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A
   smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise
   to a whole "theory" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas. Animals
   minds seem to be very definitely subcritical. Adhering to this analogy we ask, "Can a
   machine be made to be supercritical?"

   The "skin-of-an-onion" analogy is also helpful. In considering the functions of the mind
   or the brain we find certain operations which we can explain in purely mechanical terms.
   This we say does not correspond to the real mind: it is a sort of skin which we must strip
   off if we are to find the real mind. But then in what remains we find a further skin to be
   stripped off, and so on. Proceeding in this way do we ever come to the "real" mind, or do
   we eventually come to the skin which has nothing in it? In the latter case the whole mind
   is mechanical. (It would not be a discrete-state machine however. We have discussed this.)

   These last two paragraphs do not claim to be convincing arguments. They should rather
   be described as "recitations tending to produce belief."

   The only really satisfactory support that can be given for the view expressed at the
   beginning of §6, will be that provided by waiting for the end of the century and then
   doing the experiment described. But what can we say in the meantime? What steps
   should be taken now if the experiment is to be successful?

   As I have explained, the problem is mainly one of programming. Advances in engineering 
   will have to be made too, but it seems unlikely that these will not be adequate for the 
   requirements. Estimates of the storage capacity of the brain vary from $ 10^10 $ to $ 10^15 $ 
   binary digits. I incline to the lower values and believe that only a very small
   fraction is used for the higher types of thinking. Most of it is probably used for the
   retention of visual impressions, I should be surprised if more than 109 was required for
   satisfactory playing of the imitation game, at any rate against a blind man. (Note: The
   capacity of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition, is $ 2 X 10^9 $) A storage capacity of 
   $ 10^7 $, would be a very practicable possibility even by present techniques. It is probably not
   necessary to increase the speed of operations of the machines at all. Parts of modern
   machines which can be regarded as analogs of nerve cells work about a thousand times
   faster than the latter. This should provide a "margin of safety" which could cover losses
   of speed arising in many ways, Our problem then is to find out how to programme these
   machines to play the game. At my present rate of working I produce about a thousand
   digits of progratiirne a day, so that about sixty workers, working steadily through the fifty
   years might accomplish the job, if nothing went into the wastepaper basket. Some more
   expeditious method seems desirable.

   In the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind we are bound to think a good deal
   about the process which has brought it to the state that it is in. We may notice three
   components.

   (a) The initial state of the mind, say at birth,  
   (b) The education to which it has been subjected,  
   (c) Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.

   Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try
   to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate
   course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is
   something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism,
   and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost
   synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that
   something like it can be easily programmed. The amount of work in the education we can
   assume, as a first approximation, to be much the same as for the human child.

   We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The child programme and the
   education process. These two remain very closely connected. We cannot expect to find a
   good child machine at the first attempt. One must experiment with teaching one such
   machine and see how well it learns. One can then try another and see if it is better or
   worse. There is an obvious connection between this process and evolution, by the
   identifications

   Structure of the child machine = hereditary material

   Changes of the child machine = mutation,

   Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter

   One may hope, however, that this process will be more expeditious than evolution. The
   survival of the fittest is a slow method for measuring advantages. The experimenter, by
   the exercise of intelligence, should he able to speed it up. Equally important is the fact
   that he is not restricted to random mutations. If he can trace a cause for some weakness
   he can probably think of the kind of mutation which will improve it.

   It will not be possible to apply exactly the same teaching process to the machine as to a
   normal child. It will not, for instance, be provided with legs, so that it could not be asked
   to go out and fill the coal scuttle. Possibly it might not have eyes. But however well these
   deficiencies might be overcome by clever engineering, one could not send the creature to
   school without the other children making excessive fun of it. It must be given some
   tuition. We need not be too concerned about the legs, eyes, etc. The example of Miss
   Helen Keller shows that education can take place provided that communication in both
   directions between teacher and pupil can take place by some means or other.

   We normally associate punishments and rewards with the teaching process. Some simple
   child machines can be constructed or programmed on this sort of principle. The machine
   has to be so constructed that events which shortly preceded the occurrence of a
   punishment signal are unlikely to be repeated, whereas a reward signal increased the
   probability of repetition of the events which led up to it. These definitions do not
   presuppose any feelings on the part of the machine, I have done some experiments with
   one such child machine, and succeeded in teaching it a few things, but the teaching
   method was too unorthodox for the experiment to be considered really successful.

   The use of punishments and rewards can at best be a part of the teaching process.
   Roughly speaking, if the teacher has no other means of communicating to the pupil, the
   amount of information which can reach him does not exceed the total number of rewards
   and punishments applied. By the time a child has learnt to repeat "Casabianca" he would
   probably feel very sore indeed, if the text could only be discovered by a "Twenty
   Questions" technique, every "NO" taking the form of a blow. It is necessary therefore to
   have some other "unemotional" channels of communication. If these are available it is
   possible to teach a machine by punishments and rewards to obey orders given in some
   language, e.g., a symbolic language. These orders are to be transmitted through the
   "unemotional" channels. The use of this language will diminish greatly the number of
   punishments and rewards required.

   Opinions may vary as to the complexity which is suitable in the child machine. One
   might try to make it as simple as possible consistently with the general principles.
   Alternatively one might have a complete system of logical inference "built in."' In the
   latter case the store would be largely occupied with definitions and propositions. The
   propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures,
   mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having
   the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be
   described as "imperatives." The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an
   imperative is classed as "well established" the appropriate action automatically takes
   place. To illustrate this, suppose the teacher says to the machine, "Do your homework
   now." This may cause "Teacher says 'Do your homework now' " to be included amongst
   the well-established facts. Another such fact might be, "Everything that teacher says is
   true." Combining these may eventually lead to the imperative, "Do your homework now,"
   being included amongst the well-established facts, and this, by the construction of the
   machine, will mean that the homework actually gets started, but the effect is very
   satisfactory. The processes of inference used by the machine need not be such as would
   satisfy the most exacting logicians. There might for instance be no hierarchy of types. But
   this need not mean that type fallacies will occur, any more than we are bound to fall over
   unfenced cliffs. Suitable imperatives (expressed within the systems, not forming part of
   the rules of the system) such as "Do not use a class unless it is a subclass of one which
   has been mentioned by teacher" can have a similar effect to "Do not go too near the edge."

   The imperatives that can be obeyed by a machine that has no limbs are bound to be of a
   rather intellectual character, as in the example (doing homework) given above. important
   amongst such imperatives will be ones which regulate the order in which the rules of the
   logical system concerned are to be applied, For at each stage when one is using a logical
   system, there is a very large number of alternative steps, any of which one is permitted to
   apply, so far as obedience to the rules of the logical system is concerned. These choices
   make the difference between a brilliant and a footling reasoner, not the difference
   between a sound and a fallacious one. Propositions leading to imperatives of this kind
   might be "When Socrates is mentioned, use the syllogism in Barbara" or "If one method
   has been proved to be quicker than another, do not use the slower method." Some of
   these may be "given by authority," but others may be produced by the machine itself, e.g.
   by scientific induction.

   The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some readers. How can the
   rules of operation of the machine change? They should describe completely how the
   machine will react whatever its history might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The
   rules are thus quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the paradox is
   that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a rather less pretentious
   kind, claiming only an ephemeral validity. The reader may draw a parallel with the
   Constitution of the United States.

   An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely
   ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to
   predict his pupil's behavior. This should apply most strongly to the later education of a
   machine arising from a child machine of well-tried design (or programme). This is in
   clear contrast with normal procedure when using a machine to do computations one's
   object is then to have a clear mental picture of the state of the machine at each moment in
   the computation. This object can only be achieved with a struggle. The view that "the
   machine can only do what we know how to order it to do,"' appears strange in face of
   this. Most of the programmes which we can put into the machine will result in its doing
   something that we cannot make sense (if at all, or which we regard as completely random
   behaviour. Intelligent behaviour presumably consists in a departure from the completely
   disciplined behaviour involved in computation, but a rather slight one, which does not
   give rise to random behaviour, or to pointless repetitive loops. Another important result
   of preparing our machine for its part in the imitation game by a process of teaching and
   learning is that "human fallibility" is likely to be omitted in a rather natural way, i.e.,
   without special "coaching." (The reader should reconcile this with the point of view on
   pages 23 and 24.) Processes that are learnt do not produce a hundred per cent certainty of
   result; if they did they could not be unlearnt.

   It is probably wise to include a random element in a learning machine. A random element
   is rather useful when we are searching for a solution of some problem. Suppose for
   instance we wanted to find a number between 50 and 200 which was equal to the square
   of the sum of its digits, we might start at 51 then try 52 and go on until we got a number
   that worked. Alternatively we might choose numbers at random until we got a good one.
   This method has the advantage that it is unnecessary to keep track of the values that have
   been tried, but the disadvantage that one may try the same one twice, but this is not very
   important if there are several solutions. The systematic method has the disadvantage that
   there may be an enormous block without any solutions in the region which has to be
   investigated first, Now the learning process may be regarded as a search for a form of
   behaviour which will satisfy the teacher (or some other criterion). Since there is probably
   a very large number of satisfactory solutions the random method seems to be better than
   the systematic. It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of evolution.
   But there the systematic method is not possible. How could one keep track of the
   different genetical combinations that had been tried, so as to avoid trying them again?

   We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual
   fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many
   people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can
   also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that
   money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could
   follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc.
   Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried.

   We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
