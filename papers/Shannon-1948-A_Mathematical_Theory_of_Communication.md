      A Mathematical Theory of Communication
      By C. E. SHANNON

   信息的传递一直是文明进步的重要推动力，从古代的烽火台到现代的信息互联网，每一次通讯技术的革新都极大地推动社会的发展。
   1937 年出现的电报，作为工业革命时期的一项重要发明，不仅改变了人们的通讯方式，更是开启了现代通讯技术的先河。早期，
   摩尔斯发明了一种在一根导线利用突变的电流的状态传输信号的电报机，为后来电报技术的普及和应用奠定了基础。摩尔斯设想让
   自己的电报机传输 0–9 十个阿拉伯数字，然后再从代码本上，根据收到的数字来查询每个单词。显然，这是一种低效率的方法。
   好在摩尔斯还有个天才一般的助手——阿尔弗雷德·维尔。1840 年，维尔开发了一套编码系统，在纸上用点、线和空三个形状组合，
   来表示字母和数字，对就用电信息的长短来表示，这就是摩尔斯电码。而香农的两篇论文则开创了信息论，一篇是其硕士学位论文
   《继电器与开关电路的符号分析》（A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits），论文结合了乔治·布尔
   提出的逻辑代数系统，阐明如何用开关电路进行布尔逻辑运算。虽然香农的动机是解决以电话交换机取代接线员的问题，实际上这篇
   论文为现代数字计算机的基本原理奠定了基础。另外一篇就是《通讯的数学理论》，被公认是为信息论奠基的经典著作。此文中分析
   了各种信息过程的定量关系，给出了信息量的计算公式。引入了信息量的单位——比特（bit），它是二元码中一个码所包含的信息量，
   这个单位一直沿用至今。香农信息理论基于概率统计，按照他的公式，对特定的单个事件而言，发生的概率越小，所具有的信息量就越大。
   香农最初并没有借用“熵”这个词汇来表达他关于信息传输中的“不确定性”的度量化。他甚至都不太知晓他所考虑的量与古典热力学熵
   之间的类似性。他想称信息为 information，但又认为这个名词太过大众化，已被普通老百姓的日常话语用滥了。他又考虑过就用
   单词 uncertainty，但它却更像抽象名词，缺乏量化的余地。后来他遇见了天才的数学家冯 • 诺依曼（John von Neumann, 1903-1957）。
   冯·诺依曼马上告诉他：就叫它熵吧，这有两个好理由。一是你的不确定性函数已在统计物理中用到过，在那里它就叫熵。第二个理由
   更重要：没人真正理解熵为何物，这就让你在任何时候都可能进能退，立于不败之地。比特（bit）一词则是 John W. Tukey 提出。
   香农定义了比特作为信息单位（binary digits），并且计算了一个十进制数为 3.32 比特信息。

Introduction
============

   The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange
   bandwidth for signal-to-noiseratio has intensified the interest in a general theoryof communication. A
   basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist ➊ and Hartley ➋ on this subject. In the
   present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise
   in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the
   nature of the final destination of the information.

   The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or
   approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer
   to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic
   aspects of communicationare irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual
   message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each
   possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknownat the time of design.

   If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number
   can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all
   choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic
   function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the
   statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an
   essentially logarithmic measure.

   The logarithmic measure is more convenient for various reasons:

   1. It is practically more useful. Parameters of engineering importance such as time, bandwidth, number
      of relays, etc., tend to vary linearly with the logarithm of the number of possibilities. For example,
      adding one relay to a group doubles the number of possible states of the relays. It adds 1 to the base 2
      logarithm of this number. Doubling the time roughly squares the number of possible messages, or
      doubles the logarithm, etc.

   2. It is nearer to our intuitive feeling as to the proper measure. This is closely related to (1) since we
      intuitively measures entities by linear comparison with common standards. One feels, for example, that
      two punched cards should have twice the capacity of one for information storage, and two identical
      channels twice the capacity of one for transmitting information.

   3. It is mathematically more suitable. Many of the limiting operations are simple in terms of the
      logarithm but would require clumsy restatement in terms of the number of possibilities.

   The choice of a logarithmic base corresponds to the choice of a unit for measuring information. If the
   base 2 is used the resulting units may be called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by
   J. W. Tukey. A device with two stable positions, such as a relay or a flip-flop circuit, can store one bit of
   information. N such devicescan store N bits, since the total numberof possible states is $ 2^N $ and $ \log_2 2^N = N $.

   If the base 10 is used the units may be called decimal digits. Since

   $$  \log_2 M =  \frac {\log_{10} M} {\log_{10} 2}  = 3.32 \log_{10} M, $$

   a decimal digit is about $ 3 \frac{1}{3} $ bits. A digit wheel on a desk computing machine has ten stable positions and
   therefore has a storage capacity of one decimal digit. In an alytical work where integration and differentiation
   are involved the base e is sometimes useful. The resulting units of information will be called natural units.
   Change from the base a to base b merely requires multiplication by $ \log_b a $.

   Fig. 1—Schematic diagram of a general communication system.


   By a communication system we will mean a system of the type indicated schematically in Fig. 1. It
   consists of essentially five parts:

   1. An information source which producesa message or sequenceof messages to be communicatedto the
      receiving terminal. The message may be of various types: (a) A sequence of letters as in a telegraph
      of teletype system; (b) A single function of time f(t) as in radio or telephony; (c) A function of
      time and other variables as in black and white television — here the message may be thought of as a
      function f(x;y;t) of two space coordinates and time, the light intensity at point (x;y) and time t on a
      pickup tube plate; (d) Two or more functions of time, say f(t) , g(t) , h(t) — this is the case in
      “three-dimensional” sound transmission or if the system is intended to service several individual channels in
      multiplex;(e) Several functions of several variables—in color television the message consists of three
      functions f(x;y;t) , g (x;y;t) , h (x;y;t) defined in a three-dimensional continuum — we may also think
      of these three functions as components of a vector field defined in the region — similarly, several
      black and white television sources would produce “messages” consisting of a number of functions
      of three variables; (f) Various combinations also occur, for example in television with an associated
      audio channel.

   2. A transmitter which operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for
      transmission over the channel. In telephony this operation consists merely of changing sound pressure
      into a proportional electrical current. In telegraphy we have an encoding operation which produces
      a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces on the channel corresponding to the message. In a multiplex
      PCM system the different speech functions must be sampled, compressed, quantized and encoded,
      and finally interleaved properly to construct the signal. Vocoder systems, television and frequency
      modulation are other examples of complex operations applied to the message to obtain the signal.

   3. The channel is merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. It may be
      a pair of wires, a coaxial cable, a band of radio frequencies, a beam of light, etc.

   4. The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing
   t  he message from the signal.

   5. The destination is the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended.

   We wish to consider certain general problems involving communication systems. To do this it is first
   necessary to represent the various elements involved as mathematical entities, suitably idealized from their
   physical counterparts. We mayroughlyclassifycommunicationsystemsintothreemaincategories: discrete,
   continuous and mixed. By a discrete system we will mean one in which both the message and the signal
   are a sequence of discrete symbols. A typical case is telegraphy where the message is a sequence of letters
   and the signal a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces. A continuous system is one in which the message and
   signal are both treated as continuous functions, e.g., radio or television. A mixed system is one in which
   both discrete and continuous variables appear, e.g., PCM transmission of speech.

   We first consider the discrete case. This case has applications not only in communication theory, but
   also in the theory of computing machines, the design of telephone exchanges and other fields. In addition
   the discrete case forms a foundation for the continuous and mixed cases which will be treated in the second
   half of the paper.

PART I: DISCRETE NOISELESS SYSTEMS
==================================

1\. The Discrete Noiseless Channel
=================================

   Teletype and telegraphy are two simple examples of a discrete channel for transmitting information. Generally,
   a discrete channel will mean a system whereby a sequence of choices from a finite set of elementary
   symbols $ S_1 ; ... ; S_n $ can be transmitted from one point to another. Each of the symbols $ S_i $ is assumed to have
   a certain duration in time t i seconds (not necessarily the same for different $ S_i $ , for example the dots and
   dashes in telegraphy). It is not required that all possible sequences of the $ S_i $ be capable of transmission on
   the system; certain sequences only may be allowed. These will be possible signals for the channel. Thus
   in telegraphy suppose the symbols are: (1) A dot, consisting of line closure for a unit of time and then line
   open for a unit of time; (2) A dash, consisting of three time units of closure and one unit open; (3) A letter
   space consisting of, say, three units of line open; (4) A word space of six units of line open. We might place
   the restriction on allowable sequences that no spaces follow each other (for if two letter spaces are adjacent,
   it is identical with a word space). The question we now consider is how one can measure the capacity of
   such a channel to transmit information.

   In the teletype case where all symbols are of the same duration, and any sequence of the 32 symbols
   is allowed the answer is easy. Each symbol represents five bits of information. If the system transmits n
   symbols per second it is natural to say that the channel has a capacity of 5n bits per second. This does not
   mean that the teletype channel will always be transmitting information at this rate — this is the maximum
   possible rate and whether or not the actual rate reaches this maximum depends on the source of information
   which feeds the channel, as will appear later.

   In the more general case with different lengths of symbols and constraints on the allowed sequences, we
   make the following definition:

   Definition: The capacityC of a discrete channel is given by

   $$ C = \lim_{T → ∞} \frac{\log N(T)} {T} $$

   where N(T) is the number of allowed signals of duration T.

   It is easily seen that in the teletype case this reduces to the previous result. It can be shown that the limit
   in question will exist as a finite number in most cases of interest. Suppose all sequences of the symbols
   $ S_1 ; ... ; S_n $ are allowed and these symbols have durations $ t_1 ; ... ; t_n $. What is the channel capacity? If N ( t )
   represents the number of sequences of duration t we have

   $$ N(t) = N(t - t_1) + N(t - t_2) + ... + N(t - t_n). $$

   The total number is equal to the sum of the numbers of sequences ending in $ S_1 ; S_2 ; ... ; S_n $ and these are
   $ N (t - t_1); N (t - t_2); ... ; N (t - t_n) $, respectively. According to a well-known result in finite differences, N ( t )
   is then asymptotic for large t to $ X^t_0 $ where $ X_0 $ is the largest real solution of the characteristic equation:

   $$ X^{-t_1} + X^{-t_2} + ... + X^{t_n} = 1 $$

<!-- P03 -->

   and therefore

   $$ C = \log_X 0 . $$

   In case there are restrictions on allowed sequences we may still often obtain a differenceequation of this
   type and findC from the characteristic equation. In the telegraphy case mentioned above

   $$ N(t) = N(t - 2) + N(t - 4) + N(t - 5) + N(t - 7) + N(t - 8) + N(t - 10) $$

   as we see by counting sequences of symbols according to the last or next to the last symbol occurring.

   Hence C is $ -log μ_0 $ where $ μ_0 $ is the positive root of $ 1 = μ^2 + μ^4 + μ^5 + μ^7 + μ^8 + μ^{10} $. Solving this we find
   C = 0.539.

   A very general type of restriction which may be placed on allowed sequences is the following: We imagine a number
   of possible states $ a_1 ; a_2 ; ... ; a_m $. For each state only certain symbols from the set $ S_1 ; ... ; S_n $
   can be transmitted (different subsets for the different states). When one of these has been transmitted the
   state changes to a new state depending both on the old state and the particular symbol transmitted. The
   telegraph case is a simple example of this. There are two states depending on whether or not a space was
   the last symbol transmitted. If so, then only a dot or a dash can be sent next and the state always changes.
   If not, any symbol can be transmitted and the state changes if a space is sent, otherwise it remains the same.
   The conditions can be indicated in a linear graph as shown in Fig. 2. The junction points correspond to the

   states and the lines indicate the symbols possible in a state and the resulting state. In Appendix 1 it is shown
   that if the conditions on allowed sequences can be described in this form C will exist and can be calculated
   in accordance with the following result:

   Theorem 1: Let $ b^{(s)}_{ij} $ be the duration of the $ s^th $ symbol which is allowable in state i and leads to state j .
   Then the channel capacity C is equal to logW where W is the largest real root of the determinant equation:

   $$ \left | \sum_s W^{-b^{(s)}_{ij}} - \delta_{ij} \right | = 0 $$

   where $ δ_{ij} = 1 $ if i = j and is zero otherwise.

   For example, in the telegraph case (Fig. 2) the determinant is:

   $$ \left | \begin{aligned}
      & -1                   &  W^{-2} + W^{-4} ) \\
      & ( W^{-3} + W^{-6})   & ( W^{-2} + W^{-4} - 1 ) 
      \end{aligned} \right | = 0 . $$

   On expansion this leads to the equation given above for this case.

2\. The Discrete Source of Information
======================================

   We haveseen that underverygeneralconditionsthe logarithmof the numberof possible signalsin a discrete
   channel increases linearly with time. The capacity to transmit information can be specified by giving this
   rate of increase, the number of bits per second required to specify the particular signal used.

<!-- P04 -->

   We now consider the information source. How is an information source to be described mathematically,
   and how much information in bits per second is produced in a given source? The main point at issue is the
   effect of statistical knowledge about the source in reducing the required capacity of the channel, by the use
   of proper encoding of the information. In telegraphy, for example, the messages to be transmitted consist of
   sequencesof letters. These sequences, however,are not completely random. In general, they form sentences
   and have the statistical structure of, say, English. The letter E occurs more frequently than Q, the sequence
   TH more frequently than XP, etc. The existence of this structure allows one to make a saving in time (or
   channel capacity) by properly encoding the message sequences into signal sequences. This is already done
   to a limited extent in telegraphy by using the shortest channel symbol, a dot, for the most common English
   letter E; while the infrequent letters, Q, X, Z are represented by longer sequences of dots and dashes. This
   idea is carried still further in certain commercial codes where common words and phrases are represented
   by four- or five-letter code groups with a considerable saving in average time. The standardized greeting
   and anniversary telegrams now in use extend this to the point of encoding a sentence or two into a relatively
   short sequence of numbers.

   We can think of a discrete source as generating the message, symbol by symbol. It will choose
   successive symbols according to certain probabilities depending, in general, on preceding choices as well as the
   particular symbols in question. A physical system, or a mathematical model of a system which produces
   such a sequence of symbols governed by a set of probabilities, is known as a stochastic process. 3 We may
   consider a discrete source, therefore, to be represented by a stochastic process. Conversely, any stochastic
   processwhich producesa discrete sequenceofsymbolschosenfroma finite set maybe considereda discrete
   source. This will include such cases as:
   1. Natural written languages such as English, German, Chinese.

   2. Continuous information sources that have been rendered discrete by some quantizing process. For
   example, the quantized speech from a PCM transmitter, or a quantized television signal.

   3. Mathematical cases where we merely define abstractly a stochastic process which generates a
   sequence of symbols. The following are examples of this last type of source.

   (A) Suppose we have five letters A, B, C, D, E which are chosen each with probability.2, successive
   choices being independent. This would lead to a sequence of which the following is a typical
   example.

   B D C B C E C C C A D C B D D A A E C E E A
   A B B D A E E C A C E E B A E E C B C E A D.

   This was constructed with the use of a table of random numbers. 4
   (B) Using the same five letters let the probabilities be .4, .1, .2, .2, .1, respectively, with successive
   choices independent. A typical message from this source is then:
   A A A C D C B D C E A A D A D A C E D A
   E A D C A B E D A D D C E C A A A A A D.

   (C) A more complicated structure is obtained if successive symbols are not chosen independently
   but their probabilities depend on preceding letters. In the simplest case of this type a choice
   depends only on the preceding letter and not on ones before that. The statistical structure can
   then be describedby a set of transition probabilities p i ( j ) , the probabilitythat letter i is followed
   by letter j. The indices i and j range over all the possible symbols. A second equivalent way of
   specifyingthe structureis to give the “digram”probabilities p ( i ; j ) , i.e., the relative frequencyof
   the digrami j. The letter frequencies p ( i ) , (the probabilityof letter i), the transition probabilities

<!-- P05 -->

   p i ( j ) and the digram probabilities p ( i ; j ) are related by the following formulas:
   p ( i ) = ∑
   j
   p ( i ; j ) = ∑
   j
   p ( j ; i ) = ∑
   j
   p ( j ) p j ( i )
   p ( i ; j ) = p ( i ) p i ( j )
   ∑
   j
   p i ( j ) = ∑
   i
   p ( i ) = ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) = 1 :
   As a specific example suppose there are three letters A, B, C with the probability tables:
   p i ( j ) j

   A typical message from this source is the following:
   A B B A B A B A B A B A B A B B B A B B B B B A B A B A B A B A B B B A C A C A B
   B A B B B B A B B A B A C B B B A B A.

   The next increase in complexity would involve trigram frequencies but no more. The choice of
   a letter would depend on the preceding two letters but not on the message before that point. A
   set of trigram frequencies p ( i ; j ; k ) or equivalently a set of transition probabilities p ij ( k ) would
   be required. Continuing in this way one obtains successively more complicated stochastic
   processes. In the general n-gram case a set of n-gram probabilities p ( i 1 ; i 2 ; : : : ; i n ) or of transition
   probabilities p i 1
   ; i 2 ;:::; i n
   ? 1
   ( i n ) is required to specify the statistical structure.

   (D) Stochastic processes can also be defined which produce a text consisting of a sequence of
   “words.” Suppose there are five letters A, B, C, D, E and 16 “words” in the language with
   associated probabilities:
   .10 A .16 BEBE .11 CABED .04 DEB
   .04 ADEB .04 BED .05 CEED .15 DEED
   .05 ADEE .02 BEED .08 DAB .01 EAB
   .01 BADD .05 CA .04 DAD .05 EE
   Suppose successive “words” are chosen independently and are separated by a space. A typical
   message might be:
   DAB EE A BEBE DEED DEB ADEE ADEE EE DEB BEBE BEBE BEBE ADEE BED DEED
   DEED CEED ADEE A DEED DEED BEBE CABED BEBE BED DAB DEED ADEB.

   If all the words are of finite length this process is equivalent to one of the preceding type, but
   the description may be simpler in terms of the word structure and probabilities. We may also
   generalize here and introduce transition probabilities between words, etc.

   These artificial languages are useful in constructing simple problems and examples to illustrate
   various possibilities. We can also approximate to a natural language by means of a series of simple artificial
   languages. The zero-order approximation is obtained by choosing all letters with the same probability and
   independently. The first-order approximation is obtained by choosing successive letters independently but
   each letter having the same probability that it has in the natural language. 5 Thus, in the first-order
   approximation to English, E is chosen with probability .12 (its frequency in normal English) and W with
   probability .02, but there is no influence between adjacent letters and no tendency to form the preferred
   5 Letter, digram and trigram frequencies are given in Secret and Urgent by Fletcher Pratt, Blue Ribbon Books, 1939. Word
   frequencies are tabulated in Relative Frequency of English Speech Sounds, G. Dewey, Harvard University Press, 1923.

   digrams such as TH, ED, etc. In the second-order approximation, digram structure is introduced. After a
   letter is chosen, the next one is chosen in accordance with the frequencies with which the various letters
   follow the first one. This requires a table of digram frequencies p i ( j ) . In the third-order approximation,
   trigram structure is introduced. Each letter is chosen with probabilities which depend on the preceding two
   letters.

   To give a visual idea of how this series of processes approachesa language, typical sequences in the
   approximations to English have been constructed and are given below. In all cases we have assumed a 27-symbol
   “alphabet,” the 26 letters and a space.

   THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH WRITER THAT THE CHARACTER
   OF THIS POINT IS THE REFOREAN OTHER METHOD FOR THE LETTERS THAT
   THE TIME OF WHO EVER TOLD THE PROBLEM FOR AN UNEXPECTED.

   The resemblance to ordinaryEnglish text increasesquite noticeablyat each of the abovesteps. Note that
   these samples have reasonably good structure out to about twice the range that is taken into account in their
   construction. Thus in (3) the statistical process insures reasonable text for two-letter sequences, but
   fourletter sequences from the sample can usually be fitted into good sentences. In (6) sequences of four or more
   words can easily be placed in sentences without unusual or strained constructions. The particular sequence
   of ten words “attack on an English writer that the characterof this” is not at all unreasonable. It appearsthen
   that a sufficiently complex stochastic process will give a satisfactory representation of a discrete source.

   The first two samples were constructed by the use of a book of random numbers in conjunction with
   (for example 2) a table of letter frequencies. This method might have been continued for (3), (4) and (5),
   since digram, trigram and word frequency tables are available, but a simpler equivalent method was used.

<!-- P07 -->

   To construct (3) for example, one opens a book at random and selects a letter at random on the page. This
   letter is recorded. The book is then opened to another page and one reads until this letter is encountered.

   The succeeding letter is then recorded. Turning to another page this second letter is searched for and the
   succeeding letter recorded, etc. A similar process was used for (4), (5) and (6). It would be interesting if
   further approximationscould be constructed, but the labor involved becomes enormous at the next stage.

   4. G RAPHICAL R EPRESENTATION OF A M ARKOFF P ROCESS
   Stochastic processes of the type described above are known mathematically as discrete Markoff processes
   and have been extensively studied in the literature. 6 The general case can be described as follows: There
   exist a finite number of possible “states” of a system; S 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S n . In addition there is a set of transition
   probabilities; p i ( j ) the probability that if the system is in state $ S_i $ it will next go to state S j . To make this
   Markoffprocess into an informationsource we need only assume that a letter is producedfor each transition
   from one state to another. The states will correspond to the “residue of influence” from preceding letters.

   The situation can be represented graphically as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The “states” are the junction

   If a trigram example were constructed there would be at most n 2 states corresponding to the possible pairs
   of letters preceding the one being chosen. Figure 5 is a graph for the case of word structure in example D.

   5. E RGODIC AND M IXED S OURCES
   As we have indicated above a discrete source for our purposes can be considered to be represented by a
   Markoff process. Among the possible discrete Markoff processes there is a group with special properties
   of significance in communication theory. This special class consists of the “ergodic” processes and we
   shall call the correspondingsources ergodic sources. Although a rigorousdefinition of an ergodic process is
   somewhatinvolved,thegeneralideaissimple. Inanergodicprocesseverysequenceproducedbytheprocess

   is the same in statistical properties. Thus the letter frequencies, digram frequencies, etc., obtained from
   particular sequences, will, as the lengths of the sequences increase, approach definite limits independent
   of the particular sequence. Actually this is not true of every sequence but the set for which it is false has
   probability zero. Roughly the ergodic property means statistical homogeneity.

   All the examples of artificial languages given above are ergodic. This property is related to the structure
   of the corresponding graph. If the graph has the following two properties 7 the corresponding process will
   be ergodic:
   1. The graph does not consist of two isolated parts A and B such that it is impossible to go from junction
   points in part A to junction points in part B along lines of the graph in the direction of arrows and also
   impossible to go from junctions in part B to junctions in part A.

   2. A closed series of lines in the graph with all arrows on the lines pointing in the same orientation will
   be called a “circuit.” The “length”of a circuit is the numberof lines in it. Thus in Fig. 5 series BEBES
   is a circuit of length5. Thesecond propertyrequiredis that the greatest commondivisorof the lengths
   of all circuits in the graph be one.

   If the first condition is satisfied but the second one violated by having the greatest commondivisor equal
   to d > 1, the sequences have a certain type of periodic structure. The various sequences fall into d different
   classes which are statistically the same apart from a shift of the origin (i.e., which letter in the sequence is
   called letter 1). By a shift of from 0 up to d ? 1 any sequence can be made statistically equivalent to any
   other. A simple example with d = 2 is the following: There are three possible letters a ; b ; c. Letter a is
   followed with either b or c with probabilities
   1
   3
   and
   2
   3
   respectively. Either b or c is always followed by letter
   a. Thus a typical sequence is
   a b a c a c a c a b a c a b a b a c a c :
   This type of situation is not of much importance for our work.

   If the first conditionis violatedthe graphmay be separatedinto a set of subgraphseach of which satisfies
   the first condition. We will assume that the second condition is also satisfied for each subgraph. We have in
   this case what may be called a “mixed” source made up of a number of pure components. The components
   correspond to the various subgraphs. If L 1 , L 2 , L 3 ; : : : are the component sources we may write
   L = p 1 L 1 + p 2 L 2 + p 3 L 3 + ? ? ?
   7 These are restatements in terms of the graph of conditions given in Fréchet.

<!-- P09 -->

   where p i is the probability of the component source L i .

   Physically the situation represented is this: There are several different sources L 1 , L 2 , L 3 ; : : : which are
   each of homogeneous statistical structure (i.e., they are ergodic). We do not know a priori which is to be
   used, but once the sequence starts in a given pure component L i , it continues indefinitely according to the
   statistical structure of that component.

   As an example one may take two of the processes defined above and assume p 1 = : 2 and p 2 = : 8. A
   sequence from the mixed source
   L = : 2L 1 + : 8L 2
   would be obtained by choosing first L 1 or L 2 with probabilities .2 and .8 and after this choice generating a
   sequence from whichever was chosen.

   Except when the contrary is stated we shall assume a source to be ergodic. This assumption enables one
   to identifyaveragesalonga sequencewith averagesovertheensembleof possiblesequences(theprobability
   of a discrepancy being zero). For example the relative frequency of the letter A in a particular infinite
   sequence will be, with probability one, equal to its relative frequency in the ensemble of sequences.

   If P i is the probability of state i and p i ( j ) the transition probability to state j, then for the process to be
   stationary it is clear that the P i must satisfy equilibrium conditions:
   P j = ∑
   i
   P i p i ( j ):
   In the ergodic case it can be shown that with any starting conditionsthe probabilitiesP j ( N ) of being in state
   j after N symbols, approach the equilibrium values as N ! ∞.

   6. C HOICE , U NCERTAINTY AND E NTROPY
   We have represented a discrete information source as a Markoff process. Can we define a quantity which
   will measure, in some sense, how much information is “produced” by such a process, or better, at what rate
   information is produced?
   Suppose we have a set of possible events whose probabilities of occurrence are p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n . These
   probabilities are known but that is all we know concerning which event will occur. Can we find a measure
   of how much “choice” is involved in the selection of the event or of how uncertain we are of the outcome?
   If there is such a measure, say H ( p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n ) , it is reasonable to require of it the following properties:
   1. H should be continuous in the p i .

   2. If all the p i are equal, p i =
   1
   n , then H should be a monotonic increasing function of n. With equally
   likely events there is more choice, or uncertainty, when there are more possible events.

   3. If a choice be broken down into two successive choices, the original H should be the weighted sum
   of the individual values of H. The meaning of this is illustrated in Fig. 6. At the left we have three

   is because this second choice only occurs half the time.

   10
   In Appendix 2, the following result is established:
   Theorem 2: The only H satisfying the three above assumptions is of the form:
   H = ? K
   n
   ∑
   i = 1
   p i logp i
   where K is a positive constant.

   This theorem, and the assumptions required for its proof, are in no way necessary for the present theory.

   It is given chiefly to lend a certain plausibility to some of our later definitions. The real justification of these
   definitions, however, will reside in their implications.

   Quantities of the form H = ?
   ∑p
   i logp i (the constant K merely amounts to a choice of a unit of measure)
   play a central role in information theory as measures of information, choice and uncertainty. The form of H
   will be recognized as that of entropy as defined in certain formulations of statistical mechanics 8 where p i is
   the probability of a system being in cell i of its phase space. H is then, for example, the H in Boltzmann’s
   famous H theorem. We shall call H = ?
   ∑p
   i logp i the entropy of the set of probabilities p 1
   ; : : : ; p n . If x is a
   chance variable we will write H ( x ) for its entropy; thus x is not an argument of a function but a label for a
   number, to differentiate it from H ( y ) say, the entropy of the chance variable y.

   The entropy in the case of two possibilities with probabilities p and q = 1 ? p, namely
   H = ?( plogp + qlogq )
   is plotted in Fig. 7 as a function of p.

   The quantity H has a number of interesting properties which further substantiate it as a reasonable
   measure of choice or information.

   1. H = 0 if and only if all the p i but one are zero, this one having the value unity. Thus only when we
   are certain of the outcome does H vanish. Otherwise H is positive.

   2. For a given n, H is a maximum and equal to logn when all the p i are equal (i.e.,
   1
   n ). This is also
   intuitively the most uncertain situation.

   8 See, for example, R. C. Tolman, Principles of Statistical Mechanics, Oxford, Clarendon, 1938.

   11
   3. Supposethereare two events,x andy, in questionwith m possibilitiesforthe first andn forthesecond.

   Let p ( i ; j ) be the probability of the joint occurrence of i for the first and j for the second. The entropy of the
   joint event is
   H ( x ; y ) = ? ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) logp ( i ; j )
   while
   H ( x ) = ? ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) log ∑
   j
   p ( i ; j )
   H ( y ) = ? ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) log ∑
   i
   p ( i ; j ):
   It is easily shown that
   H ( x ; y ) ? H ( x ) + H ( y )
   with equality only if the events are independent (i.e., p ( i ; j ) = p ( i ) p ( j ) ). The uncertainty of a joint event is
   less than or equal to the sum of the individual uncertainties.

   4. Any change toward equalization of the probabilities p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n increases H. Thus if p 1 < p 2 and
   we increase p 1 , decreasing p 2 an equal amount so that p 1 and p 2 are more nearly equal, then H increases.

   More generally, if we perform any “averaging” operation on the p i of the form
   p
   0
   i
   = ∑
   j
   a ij p j
   where ∑ i a ij
   = ∑ j a ij = 1, and all a ij ? 0, then H increases (except in the special case where this
   transformation amounts to no more than a permutation of the p j with H of course remaining the same).

   5. Suppose there are two chance events x and y as in 3, not necessarily independent. For any particular
   value i that x can assume there is a conditional probability p i ( j ) that y has the value j. This is given by
   p i ( j ) =
   p ( i ; j )
   ∑ j p
   ( i ; j )
   :
   We define the conditionalentropy of y, H x ( y ) as the average of the entropy of y for each value of x, weighted
   according to the probability of getting that particular x. That is
   H x ( y ) = ? ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) logp i ( j ) :
   This quantity measures how uncertain we are of y on the average when we know x. Substituting the value of
   p i ( j ) we obtain
   H x ( y ) = ? ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) logp ( i ; j ) + ∑
   i ; j
   p ( i ; j ) log ∑
   j
   p ( i ; j )
   = H ( x ; y ) ? H ( x )
   or
   H ( x ; y ) = H ( x ) + H x ( y ):
   The uncertainty (or entropy) of the joint event x ; y is the uncertainty of x plus the uncertainty of y when x is
   known.

   6. From 3 and 5 we have
   H ( x ) + H ( y ) ? H ( x ; y ) = H ( x ) + H x ( y ):
   Hence
   H ( y ) ? H x ( y ):
   Theuncertaintyofyisneverincreasedbyknowledgeofx. Itwillbedecreasedunlessxandyareindependent
   events, in which case it is not changed.

   7. T HE E NTROPY OF AN I NFORMATION S OURCE
   Consider a discrete source of the finite state type considered above. For each possible state i there will be a
   set of probabilities p i ( j ) of producing the various possible symbols j. Thus there is an entropy H i for each
   state. The entropy of the source will be defined as the average of these H i weighted in accordance with the
   probability of occurrence of the states in question:
   H = ∑
   i
   P i H i
   = ? ∑
   i ; j
   P i p i ( j ) logp i ( j ) :
   This is the entropy of the source per symbol of text. If the Markoff process is proceeding at a definite time
   rate there is also an entropy per second
   H
   0
   = ∑
   i
   f i H i
   where f i is the average frequency (occurrences per second) of state i. Clearly
   H
   0
   = mH
   where m is the average number of symbols produced per second. H or H
   0
   measures the amount of
   information generated by the source per symbol or per second. If the logarithmic base is 2, they will represent bits
   per symbol or per second.

   If successive symbols are independent then H is simply ?
   ∑p
   i logp i where p i is the probability of
   symbol i. Suppose in this case we consider a long message of N symbols. It will contain with high probability
   about p 1 N occurrencesof the first symbol, p 2 N occurrencesof the second, etc. Hence the probabilityof this
   particular message will be roughly
   p = p p 1 N

   :
   H is thus approximatelythe logarithmof the reciprocalprobabilityof a typical long sequence divided by the
   number of symbols in the sequence. The same result holds for any source. Stated more precisely we have
   (see Appendix 3):
   Theorem 3: Given any ? > 0 and ? > 0 , we can find an N 0 such that the sequences of any length N ? N 0
   fall into two classes:
   1. A set whose total probability is less than ? .

   2. The remainder, all of whose members have probabilities satisfying the inequality

   < ? :
   In other words we are almost certain to have
   logp
   ? 1
   N
   very close to H when N is large.

   A closely related result deals with the number of sequences of various probabilities. Consider again the
   sequences of length N and let them be arranged in order of decreasing probability. We define n ( q ) to be
   the number we must take from this set starting with the most probable one in order to accumulate a total
   probability q for those taken.

   13
   Theorem 4:
   Lim
   N ! ∞
   logn ( q )
   N
   = H
   when q does not equal 0 or 1 .

   We may interpret logn ( q ) as the number of bits required to specify the sequence when we consider only
   the most probable sequences with a total probability q. Then
   logn ( q )
   N
   is the number of bits per symbol for
   the specification. The theorem says that for large N this will be independent of q and equal to H. The rate
   of growth of the logarithm of the number of reasonably probable sequences is given by H, regardless of our
   interpretation of “reasonably probable.” Due to these results, which are proved in Appendix 3, it is possible
   for most purposesto treat the long sequences as though there were just 2 HN of them, each with a probability
   2
   ? HN .

   The next two theorems show that H and H
   0
   can be determined by limiting operations directly from
   the statistics of the message sequences, without reference to the states and transition probabilities between
   states.

   = H :
   Theorem 6: Let p ( B i ; S j ) be the probability of sequence B i followed by symbol S j and p B i ( S j ) =

   F N = ? ∑

   where the sum is over all blocks B i of N ? 1 symbols and over all symbols S j . Then F N is a monotonic

   These results are derivedin Appendix3. They show that a series of approximationsto H can be obtained
   by considering only the statistical structure of the sequences extending over 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; N symbols. F N is the
   better approximation. In fact F N is the entropy of the N th order approximation to the source of the type
   discussed above. If there are no statistical influences extending over more than N symbols, that is if the
   conditional probability of the next symbol knowing the preceding ( N ? 1 ) is not changedby a knowledge of
   any before that, then F N = H. F N of course is the conditional entropy of the next symbol when the ( N ? 1 )
   preceding ones are known, while G N is the entropy per symbol of blocks of N symbols.

   The ratio of the entropy of a source to the maximum value it could have while still restricted to the same
   symbols will be called its relative entropy. This is the maximumcompression possible when we encode into
   the same alphabet. One minus the relative entropy is the redundancy. The redundancy of ordinary English,
   not considering statistical structure over greater distances than about eight letters, is roughly 50%. This
   means that when we write English half of what we write is determined by the structure of the language and
   half is chosen freely. The figure 50% was found by several independent methods which all gave results in
   14
   this neighborhood. One is by calculation of the entropy of the approximationsto English. A second method
   is to delete a certain fraction of the letters from a sample of English text and then let someone attempt to
   restore them. If they can be restored when 50% are deleted the redundancy must be greater than 50%. A
   third method depends on certain known results in cryptography.

   Two extremes of redundancy in English prose are represented by Basic English and by James Joyce’s
   book “Finnegans Wake”. The Basic English vocabulary is limited to 850 words and the redundancy is very
   high. This is reflected in the expansion that occurs when a passage is translated into Basic English. Joyce
   on the other hand enlarges the vocabulary and is alleged to achieve a compression of semantic content.

   The redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is
   zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any two-dimensional array of letters
   formsa crossword puzzle. If the redundancyis too high the languageimposestoo manyconstraintsfor large
   crossword puzzles to be possible. A more detailed analysis shows that if we assume the constraintsimposed
   by the language are of a rather chaotic and random nature, large crossword puzzles are just possible when
   the redundancy is 50%. If the redundancy is 33%, three-dimensional crossword puzzles should be possible,
   etc.

   8. R EPRESENTATION OF THE E NCODING AND D ECODING O PERATIONS
   We have yet to represent mathematically the operations performed by the transmitter and receiver in
   encoding and decoding the information. Either of these will be called a discrete transducer. The input to the
   transducer is a sequence of input symbols and its output a sequence of output symbols. The transducer may
   have an internal memory so that its output dependsnot only on the present input symbol but also on the past
   history. We assume that the internal memory is finite, i.e., there exist a finite numberm of possible states of
   the transducer and that its output is a function of the present state and the present input symbol. The next
   state will be a second function of these two quantities. Thus a transducer can be described by two functions:
   y n = f( x n ; ? n )
   ? n
   + 1
   = g ( x n ; ? n )
   where
   x n is the n th input symbol,
   ? n is the state of the transducer when the n th input symbol is introduced,
   y n is the output symbol (or sequence of output symbols) produced when x n is introduced if the state is ? n .

   If the output symbols of one transducer can be identified with the input symbols of a second, they can be
   connected in tandem and the result is also a transducer. If there exists a second transducer which operates
   on the output of the first and recovers the original input, the first transducer will be called non-singular and
   the second will be called its inverse.

   Theorem 7: The output of a finite state transducer driven by a finite state statistical source is a finite
   state statistical source, with entropy (per unit time) less than or equal to that of the input. If the transducer
   is non-singular they are equal.

   Let ? representthe state of the source, which producesa sequence of symbols x i ; and let ? be the state of
   the transducer,whichproduces,inits output,blocksofsymbolsy j . Thecombinedsystemcan berepresented
   by the “product state space” of pairs (?; ? ) . Two points in the space (? 1 ; ? 1 ) and (? 2 ; ? 2 ) , are connected by
   a line if ? 1 can produce an x which changes ? 1 to ? 2 , and this line is given the probability of that x in this
   case. The line is labeled with the block of y j symbols produced by the transducer. The entropy of the output
   can be calculated as the weighted sum over the states. If we sum first on ? each resulting term is less than or
   equal to the corresponding term for ? , hence the entropy is not increased. If the transducer is non-singular
   let its output be connected to the inverse transducer. If H
   0
   1 , H
   0
   2 and H
   0

   Suppose we have a system of constraints on possible sequences of the type which can be represented by
   a linear graph as in Fig. 2. If probabilities p
   ( s )
   ij
   were assigned to the various lines connecting state i to state j
   this would become a source. There is one particular assignment which maximizes the resulting entropy (see
   Appendix 4).

   Theorem 8: Let the system of constraints considered as a channel have a capacity C = logW . If we
   assign
   p
   ( s )
   ij
   =
   B j
   B i

   ( s )
   ij
   where `
   ( s )
   ij
   is the duration of the s th symbol leading from state i to state j and the B i satisfy
   B i = ∑
   s ; j
   B j W
   ?`
   ( s )
   ij
   then H is maximized and equal to C .

   By proper assignment of the transition probabilities the entropy of symbols on a channel can be
   maximized at the channel capacity.

   9. T HE F UNDAMENTAL T HEOREM FOR A N OISELESS C HANNEL
   We will now justify our interpretation of H as the rate of generating information by proving that H
   determines the channel capacity required with most efficient coding.

   Theorem 9: Let a source have entropy H ( bits per symbol ) and a channel have a capacity C ( bits per
   second ) . Then it is possible to encode the output of the source in such a way as to transmit at the average
   rate
   C
   H
   ? ? symbols per second over the channel where ? is arbitrarily small. It is not possible to transmit at
   an average rate greater than
   C
   H
   .

   The converse part of the theorem, that
   C
   H
   cannot be exceeded, may be proved by noting that the entropy
   of the channel input per second is equal to that of the source, since the transmitter must be non-singular,and
   also this entropy cannot exceed the channel capacity. Hence H
   0
   ? C and the number of symbols per second
   = H
   0
   = H ? C = H.

   The first part of the theorem will be proved in two different ways. The first method is to consider the
   set of all sequences of N symbols produced by the source. For N large we can divide these into two groups,
   one containing less than 2
   ( H +? ) N
   members and the second containing less than 2 RN members (where R is
   the logarithm of the number of different symbols) and having a total probability less than ? . As N increases
   ? and ? approach zero. The number of signals of duration T in the channel is greater than 2
   ( C ?? ) T
   with ?
   small when T is large. if we choose
   T =
   ? H
   C
   + ?
   ?
   N
   then there will be a sufficient number of sequences of channel symbols for the high probability group when
   N and T are sufficiently large (however small ? ) and also some additional ones. The high probability group
   is coded in an arbitrary one-to-one way into this set. The remaining sequences are represented by larger
   sequences, starting and ending with one of the sequences not used for the high probability group. This
   special sequence acts as a start and stop signal for a different code. In between a sufficient time is allowed
   to give enough different sequences for all the low probability messages. This will require
   T 1 =
   ?
   R
   C
   + '
   ?
   N
   where ' is small. The mean rate of transmission in message symbols per second will then be greater than

   As N increases ? , ? and ' approach zero and the rate approaches
   C

   .

   Anothermethod of performingthis codingand thereby provingthe theorem can be described as follows:
   Arrange the messages of length N in order of decreasing probability and suppose their probabilities are
   p 1 ? p 2 ? p 3 ? ? ? ? p n . Let P s = ∑ s
   ? 1
   1
   p i ; that is P s is the cumulative probability up to, but not including, p s .

   We first encode into a binary system. The binary code for message s is obtained by expandingP s as a binary
   number. The expansion is carried out to m s places, where m s is the integer satisfying:
   log 2
   1
   p s
   ? m s < 1 + log 2
   1
   p s
   :
   Thus the messages of high probability are represented by short codes and those of low probability by long
   codes. From these inequalities we have
   1
   2 m s
   ? p s <
   1
   2 m s
   ? 1
   :
   The code for P s will differ from all succeeding ones in one or more of its m s places, since all the remaining
   P i are at least
   1
   2 m s
   larger and their binary expansions therefore differ in the first m s places. Consequently all
   the codes are different and it is possible to recover the message from its code. If the channel sequences are
   not already sequences of binary digits, they can be ascribed binary numbers in an arbitrary fashion and the
   binary code thus translated into signals suitable for the channel.

   The average number H
   0
   of binary digits used per symbol of original message is easily estimated. We
   have
   H
   0
   =
   1
   N
   ∑ m s p s
   :
   But,
   1

   p s
   ?
   p s
   and therefore,
   G N ? H
   0
   < G N +
   1
   N
   As N increases G N approaches H, the entropy of the source and H
   0
   approaches H.

   We see from this that the inefficiency in coding, when only a finite delay of N symbols is used, need
   not be greater than
   1
   N
   plus the difference between the true entropy H and the entropy G N calculated for
   sequences of length N. The per cent excess time needed over the ideal is therefore less than
   G N
   H
   +
   1
   HN
   ? 1 :
   This method of encoding is substantially the same as one found independently by R. M. Fano. 9 His
   method is to arrange the messages of length N in order of decreasing probability. Divide this series into two
   groups of as nearly equal probability as possible. If the message is in the first group its first binary digit
   will be 0, otherwise 1. The groups are similarly divided into subsets of nearly equal probability and the
   particular subset determines the second binary digit. This process is continued until each subset contains
   only onemessage. It is easily seen that apart fromminor differences(generallyin the last digit)this amounts
   to the same thing as the arithmetic process described above.

   10. D ISCUSSION AND E XAMPLES
   In order to obtain the maximum power transfer from a generator to a load, a transformer must in general be
   introduced so that the generator as seen from the load has the load resistance. The situation here is roughly
   analogous. The transducer which does the encoding should match the source to the channel in a statistical
   sense. The source as seen from the channel through the transducer should have the same statistical structure
   9 Technical Report No. 65, The Research Laboratory of Electronics, M.I.T., March 17, 1949.

   17
   as the source which maximizes the entropy in the channel. The content of Theorem 9 is that, although an
   exact match is not in general possible, we can approximate it as closely as desired. The ratio of the actual
   rate of transmission to the capacity C may be called the efficiency of the coding system. This is of course
   equal to the ratio of the actual entropy of the channel symbols to the maximum possible entropy.

   In general, ideal or nearly ideal encoding requires a long delay in the transmitter and receiver. In the
   noiseless case which we have been considering, the main function of this delay is to allow reasonably good
   matching of probabilities to corresponding lengths of sequences. With a good code the logarithm of the
   reciprocal probability of a long message must be proportionalto the duration of the correspondingsignal, in
   fact

   must be small for all but a small fraction of the long messages.

   If a source can produce only one particular message its entropy is zero, and no channel is required. For
   example, a computing machine set up to calculate the successive digits of ? produces a definite sequence
   with no chance element. No channel is required to “transmit” this to another point. One could construct a
   secondmachineto computethesame sequenceatthe point. However,thismaybeimpractical. Insucha case
   we can choose to ignore some or all of the statistical knowledge we have of the source. We might consider
   the digits of ? to be a random sequence in that we construct a system capable of sending any sequence of
   digits. In a similar way we may choose to use some of our statistical knowledge of English in constructing
   a code, but not all of it. In such a case we consider the source with the maximum entropy subject to the
   statistical conditions we wish to retain. The entropy of this source determines the channel capacity which
   is necessary and sufficient. In the ? example the only information retained is that all the digits are chosen
   from the set 0 ; 1 ; : : : ; 9. In the case of English one might wish to use the statistical saving possible due to
   letter frequencies, but nothing else. The maximum entropy source is then the first approximation to English
   and its entropy determines the required channel capacity.

   As a simple example of some of these results consider a source which produces a sequence of letters

   Thus we can approximate a coding system to encode messages from this source into binary digits with an

   binarydigit per symbol. In this case we can actually achievethe limiting value by the following

   :
   It is easily seen that the binary digits 0, 1 have probabilities
   1
   2 ,
   1
   2
   so the H for the coded sequences is one
   bit per symbol. Since, on the average, we have
   7
   4
   binary symbols per original letter, the entropies on a time
   basis are the same. The maximum possible entropy for the original set is log4 = 2, occurring when A, B,C,
   D have probabilities
   1
   4 ,
   1
   4 ,
   1
   4 ,
   1
   4 . Hence the relative entropy is
   7
   8 . We can translate the binary sequences into
   the original set of symbols on a two-to-one basis by the following table:
   00 A
   0
   01 B
   0
   10 C
   0
   11 D
   0
   18
   This double process then encodes the original message into the same symbols but with an average
   compression ratio
   7
   8 .

   As a second example consider a source which produces a sequence of A’s and B’s with probability p for
   A and q for B. If p ? q we have
   H = ? logp p ( 1 ? p ) 1
   ? p
   = ? plogp ( 1 ? p )
   ( 1 ? p )= p
   :
   = plog
   e
   p
   :
   In such a case one can construct a fairly good coding of the message on a 0, 1 channel by sending a special
   sequence, say 0000, for the infrequentsymbol A and then a sequence indicating the number of B’s following
   it. This could be indicated by the binary representation with all numbers containing the special sequence
   deleted. All numbersup to 16 are represented as usual; 16 is represented by the next binary number after 16
   which does not contain four zeros, namely 17 = 10001, etc.

   It can be shown that as p ! 0 the coding approachesideal provided the length of the special sequence is
   properly adjusted.

   PART II: THE DISCRETE CHANNEL WITH NOISE
   11. R EPRESENTATION OF A N OISY D ISCRETE C HANNEL
   We now consider the case where the signal is perturbed by noise during transmission or at one or the other
   of the terminals. This means that the received signal is not necessarily the same as that sent out by the
   transmitter. Two cases may be distinguished. If a particular transmitted signal always produces the same
   receivedsignal, i.e., the receivedsignal is a definite functionof the transmitted signal, then the effect may be
   called distortion. If this function has an inverse — no two transmitted signals producing the same received
   signal — distortion may be corrected, at least in principle, by merely performing the inverse functional
   operation on the received signal.

   The case of interest here is that in which the signal does not always undergo the same change in
   transmission. In this case we may assume the received signal E to be a function of the transmitted signal S and a
   second variable, the noise N.

   E = f ( S ; N )
   The noise is considered to be a chance variable just as the message was above. In general it may be
   represented by a suitable stochastic process. The most general type of noisy discrete channel we shall consider
   is a generalization of the finite state noise-free channel described previously. We assume a finite number of
   states and a set of probabilities
   p
   ?; i
   (? ; j ):
   This is the probability, if the channel is in state ? and symbol i is transmitted, that symbol j will be received
   and the channel left in state ? . Thus ? and ? range over the possible states, i over the possible transmitted
   signalsand j overthepossible receivedsignals. Inthecase wheresuccessive symbols are independently perturbed
   by the noise there is only one state, and the channel is described by the set of transition probabilities
   p i ( j ) , the probability of transmitted symbol i being received as j.

   If a noisy channel is fed by a source there are two statistical processes at work: the source and the noise.

   Thus there are a number of entropies that can be calculated. First there is the entropy H ( x ) of the source
   or of the input to the channel (these will be equal if the transmitter is non-singular). The entropy of the
   output of the channel, i.e., the received signal, will be denoted by H ( y ) . In the noiseless case H ( y ) = H ( x ) .

   The joint entropy of input and output will be H ( xy ) . Finally there are two conditional entropies H x ( y ) and
   H y ( x ) , the entropy of the output when the input is known and conversely. Among these quantities we have
   the relations
   H ( x ; y ) = H ( x ) + H x ( y ) = H ( y ) + H y ( x ):
   All of these entropies can be measured on a per-second or a per-symbol basis.

   19
   12. E QUIVOCATION AND C HANNEL C APACITY
   If the channel is noisy it is not in general possible to reconstruct the original message or the transmitted
   signal with certainty by any operation on the received signal E. There are, however, ways of transmitting
   the information which are optimal in combating noise. This is the problem which we now consider.

   Suppose there are two possible symbols 0 and 1, and we are transmitting at a rate of 1000 symbols per
   second with probabilities p 0 = p 1 =
   1
   2 . Thus our source is producing information at the rate of 1000 bits
   per second. During transmission the noise introduces errors so that, on the average, 1 in 100 is received
   incorrectly (a 0 as 1, or 1 as 0). What is the rate of transmission of information? Certainly less than 1000
   bits per second since about 1% of the received symbols are incorrect. Our first impulse might be to say
   the rate is 990 bits per second, merely subtracting the expected number of errors. This is not satisfactory
   since it fails to take into account the recipient’s lack of knowledge of where the errors occur. We may carry
   it to an extreme case and suppose the noise so great that the received symbols are entirely independent of
   the transmitted symbols. The probability of receiving 1 is
   1
   2
   whatever was transmitted and similarly for 0.

   Then about half of the received symbolsare correct due to chance alone, and we would be giving the system
   credit for transmitting 500 bits per second while actually no information is being transmitted at all. Equally
   “good” transmission would be obtained by dispensing with the channel entirely and flipping a coin at the
   receiving point.

   Evidently the proper correction to apply to the amount of information transmitted is the amount of this
   information which is missing in the received signal, or alternatively the uncertainty when we have received
   a signal of what was actually sent. From our previous discussion of entropy as a measure of uncertainty it
   seems reasonable to use the conditional entropy of the message, knowing the received signal, as a measure
   of this missing information. This is indeed the proper definition, as we shall see later. Following this idea
   the rate of actual transmission, R, would be obtained by subtracting from the rate of production (i.e., the
   entropy of the source) the average rate of conditional entropy.

   R = H ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   The conditionalentropy H y ( x ) will, for convenience,be called the equivocation. It measures the average
   ambiguity of the received signal.

   In the example considered above, if a 0 is received the a posteriori probability that a 0 was transmitted
   is .99, and that a 1 was transmitted is .01. These figures are reversed if a 1 is received. Hence
   H y ( x ) = ?[: 99log : 99 + 0 : 01log0 : 01 ]
   = : 081 bits/symbol
   or 81 bits per second. We may say that the system is transmitting at a rate 1000 ? 81 = 919 bits per second.

   In the extreme case where a 0 is equally likely to be received as a 0 or 1 and similarly for 1, the a posteriori
   probabilities are
   1
   2 ,
   1
   2
   and
   H y ( x ) = ?

   2
   ?
   = 1 bit per symbol
   or 1000 bits per second. The rate of transmission is then 0 as it should be.

   Thefollowingtheoremgivesa direct intuitiveinterpretationof the equivocationandalso servesto justify
   it as the unique appropriate measure. We consider a communication system and an observer (or auxiliary
   device) who can see both what is sent and what is recovered (with errors due to noise). This observer notes
   the errors in the recovered message and transmits data to the receiving point over a “correction channel” to
   enable the receiver to correct the errors. The situation is indicated schematically in Fig. 8.

   Theorem 10: If the correction channel has a capacity equal to H y ( x ) it is possible to so encode the
   correction data as to send it over this channel and correct all but an arbitrarily small fraction ? of the errors.

   This is not possible if the channel capacity is less than H y ( x ) .

   Roughly then, H y ( x ) is the amount of additional information that must be supplied per second at the
   receiving point to correct the received message.

   To prove the first part, consider long sequences of received message M
   0
   and corresponding original
   message M. There will be logarithmically TH y ( x ) of the M’s which could reasonably have produced each
   M
   0 . Thus we have TH y
   ( x ) binary digits to send each T seconds. This can be done with ? frequency of errors
   on a channel of capacity H y ( x ) .

   The second part can be proved by noting, first, that for any discrete chance variables x, y, z
   H y ( x ; z ) ? H y ( x ):
   The left-hand side can be expanded to give
   H y ( z ) + H yz ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   H yz ( x ) ? H y ( x ) ? H y ( z ) ? H y ( x ) ? H ( z ):
   If we identifyx as the outputof the source,y asthe receivedsignal and zas the signal sent overthe correction
   channel,thenthe right-handside isthe equivocationless therate oftransmissionoverthe correctionchannel.

   If the capacity of this channel is less than the equivocation the right-hand side will be greater than zero and
   H yz ( x ) > 0. But this is the uncertaintyof what was sent, knowing both the received signal and the correction
   signal. If this is greater than zero the frequency of errors cannot be arbitrarily small.

   Example:
   Suppose the errors occur at random in a sequence of binary digits: probability p that a digit is wrong
   and q = 1 ? p that it is right. These errors can be corrected if their position is known. Thus the
   correction channel need only send information as to these positions. This amounts to transmitting
   from a source which produces binary digits with probability p for 1 (incorrect) and q for 0 (correct).

   This requires a channel of capacity
   ?[ plogp + qlogq ]
   which is the equivocation of the original system.

   The rate of transmission R can be written in two other forms due to the identities noted above. We have
   R = H ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   = H ( y ) ? H x ( y )
   = H ( x ) + H ( y ) ? H ( x ; y ):
   21
   The first defining expression has already been interpreted as the amount of information sent less the
   uncertainty of what was sent. The second measures the amountreceived less the part of this which is due to noise.

   The third is the sum of the two amounts less the joint entropy and therefore in a sense is the number of bits
   per second common to the two. Thus all three expressions have a certain intuitive significance.

   The capacity C of a noisy channel should be the maximum possible rate of transmission, i.e., the rate
   when the source is properly matched to the channel. We therefore define the channel capacity by
   C = Max
   ? H
   ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   ?
   where the maximum is with respect to all possible information sources used as input to the channel. If the
   channelisnoiseless, H y ( x ) = 0. Thedefinitionis thenequivalentto that alreadygivenfora noiselesschannel
   since the maximum entropy for the channel is its capacity.

   13. T HE F UNDAMENTAL T HEOREM FOR A D ISCRETE C HANNEL WITH N OISE
   It may seem surprising that we should define a definite capacity C for a noisy channel since we can never
   send certain information in such a case. It is clear, however, that by sending the information in a redundant
   form the probability of errors can be reduced. For example, by repeating the message many times and by a
   statistical studyofthe differentreceivedversionsofthe messagethe probabilityof errorscouldbemadevery
   small. One would expect, however, that to make this probability of errors approach zero, the redundancy
   of the encoding must increase indefinitely, and the rate of transmission therefore approach zero. This is by
   no means true. If it were, there would not be a very well defined capacity, but only a capacity for a given
   frequency of errors, or a given equivocation; the capacity going down as the error requirements are made
   more stringent. Actually the capacityC defined above has a very definite significance. It is possible to send
   information at the rateC through the channel with as small a frequency of errors or equivocation as desired
   by proper encoding. This statement is not true for any rate greater thanC. If an attempt is made to transmit
   at a higher rate thanC, sayC + R 1 , then there will necessarily be an equivocationequal to or greater than the
   excess R 1 . Nature takes payment by requiring just that much uncertainty, so that we are not actually getting
   any more thanC through correctly.

   The situation is indicated in Fig. 9. The rate of information into the channel is plotted horizontally and
   the equivocation vertically. Any point above the heavy line in the shaded region can be attained and those
   below cannot. The points on the line cannot in general be attained, but there will usually be two points on
   the line that can.

   These results are the main justification for the definition of C and will now be proved.

   Theorem 11: Let a discrete channel have the capacity C and a discrete source the entropy per second H .

   If H ? C there exists a coding system such that the output of the source can be transmitted over the channel
   with an arbitrarily small frequency of errors (or an arbitrarily small equivocation). If H > C it is possible
   to encode the source so that the equivocation is less than H ? C + ? where ? is arbitrarily small. There is no
   method of encoding which gives an equivocation less than H ? C .

   The method of proving the first part of this theorem is not by exhibiting a coding method having the
   desired properties, but by showing that such a code must exist in a certain group of codes. In fact we will

   Fig. 9—The equivocation possible for a given input entropy to a channel.

   22
   average the frequency of errors over this group and show that this average can be made less than ? . If the
   average of a set of numbers is less than ? there must exist at least one in the set which is less than ? . This
   will establish the desired result.

   The capacity C of a noisy channel has been defined as
   C = Max
   ? H
   ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   ?
   where x is the input and y the output. The maximization is over all sources which might be used as input to
   the channel.

   Let S 0 be a source which achieves the maximum capacity C. If this maximum is not actually achieved
   by any source let S 0 be a source which approximates to giving the maximum rate. Suppose S 0 is used as
   input to the channel. We consider the possible transmitted and received sequences of a long durationT. The
   following will be true:
   1. The transmitted sequences fall into two classes, a high probability group with about 2 TH
   ( x )
   members
   and the remaining sequences of small total probability.

   2. Similarly the received sequences have a high probability set of about 2 TH
   ( y )
   members and a low
   probability set of remaining sequences.

   3. Each high probability output could be produced by about 2 TH y
   ( x )
   inputs. The probability of all other
   cases has a small total probability.

   All the ? ’s and ? ’s implied by the words “small” and “about” in these statements approach zero as we
   allow T to increase and S 0 to approach the maximizing source.

   The situation is summarized in Fig. 10 where the input sequences are points on the left and output
   sequences points on the right. The fan of cross lines represents the range of possible causes for a typical
   output.

   Now suppose we have another source producing information at rate R with R < C. In the period T this
   source will have 2 TR high probability messages. We wish to associate these with a selection of the possible
   channel inputs in such a way as to get a small frequency of errors. We will set up this association in all
   23
   possible ways (using, however, only the high probability group of inputs as determined by the source S 0 )
   and average the frequency of errors for this large class of possible coding systems. This is the same as
   calculating the frequency of errors for a random association of the messages and channel inputs of duration
   T. Suppose a particular output y 1 is observed. What is the probability of more than one message in the set
   of possible causes of y 1 ? There are 2 TR messages distributed at random in 2 TH
   ( x )
   points. The probability of
   a particular point being a message is thus
   2 T
   ( R ? H ( x ))
   :
   The probability that none of the points in the fan is a message (apart from the actual originating message) is
   P =
   ? 1
   ? 2 T
   ( R ? H ( x ))
   ? 2 TH y
   ( x )
   :
   Now R < H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) so R ? H ( x ) = ? H y ( x ) ? ? with ? positive. Consequently
   P =
   ? 1
   ? 2
   ? TH y ( x )? T ?
   ? 2 TH y
   ( x )
   approaches (as T ! ∞)
   1 ? 2
   ? T ?
   :
   Hence the probability of an error approaches zero and the first part of the theorem is proved.

   The second part of the theorem is easily shown by noting that we could merely send C bits per second
   from the source, completely neglecting the remainder of the information generated. At the receiver the
   neglected part gives an equivocation H ( x ) ? C and the part transmitted need only add ? . This limit can also
   be attained in many other ways, as will be shown when we consider the continuous case.

   Thelast statement of the theoremis a simple consequenceof ourdefinitionofC. Supposewe can encode
   a source with H ( x ) = C + a in such a way as to obtain an equivocation H y ( x ) = a ? ? with ? positive. Then
   R = H ( x ) = C + a and
   H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) = C + ?
   with ? positive. This contradicts the definition of C as the maximum of H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) .

   Actually more has been proved than was stated in the theorem. If the average of a set of numbers is
   within ? of of their maximum, a fraction of at most
   p
   ? can be more than
   p
   ? below the maximum. Since ? is
   arbitrarily small we can say that almost all the systems are arbitrarily close to the ideal.

   14. D ISCUSSION
   The demonstration of Theorem 11, while not a pure existence proof, has some of the deficiencies of such
   proofs. An attempt to obtain a good approximation to ideal coding by following the method of the proof is
   generally impractical. In fact, apart from some rather trivial cases and certain limiting situations, no explicit
   description of a series of approximation to the ideal has been found. Probably this is no accident but is
   related to the difficulty of giving an explicit construction for a good approximation to a random sequence.

   An approximation to the ideal would have the property that if the signal is altered in a reasonable way
   by the noise, the original can still be recovered. In other words the alteration will not in general bring it
   closer to another reasonable signal than the original. This is accomplished at the cost of a certain amount of
   redundancy in the coding. The redundancy must be introduced in the proper way to combat the particular
   noise structure involved. However, any redundancy in the source will usually help if it is utilized at the
   receiving point. In particular, if the source already has a certain redundancy and no attempt is made to
   eliminate it in matching to the channel, this redundancywill help combat noise. For example, in a noiseless
   telegraph channel one could save about 50% in time by proper encoding of the messages. This is not done
   and most of the redundancy of English remains in the channel symbols. This has the advantage, however,
   of allowing considerable noise in the channel. A sizable fraction of the letters can be received incorrectly
   and still reconstructed by the context. In fact this is probably not a bad approximation to the ideal in many
   cases, since the statistical structure of English is rather involved and the reasonable English sequences are
   not too far (in the sense required for the theorem) from a random selection.

   24
   As in the noiseless case a delay is generally required to approach the ideal encoding. It now has the
   additional function of allowing a large sample of noise to affect the signal before any judgment is made
   at the receiving point as to the original message. Increasing the sample size always sharpens the possible
   statistical assertions.

   The content of Theorem 11 and its proof can be formulated in a somewhat different way which exhibits
   the connectionwith the noiseless case more clearly. Consider the possible signals of duration T and suppose
   a subset of them is selected to be used. Let those in the subset all be usedwith equalprobability,andsuppose
   the receiver is constructed to select, as the original signal, the most probable cause from the subset, when a
   perturbed signal is received. We define N ( T ; q ) to be the maximum number of signals we can choose for the
   subset such that the probability of an incorrect interpretation is less than or equal to q.

   Theorem 12: Lim
   T ! ∞
   logN ( T ; q )
   T
   = C , where C is the channel capacity, provided that q does not equal 0 or
   1.

   In other words, no matter how we set out limits of reliability, we can distinguish reliably in time T
   enoughmessages to correspondto aboutCT bits, when T is sufficiently large. Theorem12 can be compared
   with the definition of the capacity of a noiseless channel given in Section 1.

   15. E XAMPLE OF A D ISCRETE C HANNEL AND ITS C APACITY
   A simple example of a discrete channel is indicated in Fig. 11. There are three possible symbols. The first is
   never affected by noise. The second and third each have probability p of coming through undisturbed, and
   q of being changed into the other of the pair. We have (letting ? = ?[ plogp + qlogq ] and P and Q be the

   H ( x ) = ? PlogP ? 2QlogQ
   H y ( x ) = 2Q ?:
   We wish to chooseP andQ in such a way as to maximizeH ( x ) ? H y ( x ) , subject to the constraint P + 2Q = 1.

   Hence we consider
   U = ? PlogP ? 2QlogQ ? 2Q ? + ?( P + 2Q )
   ∂U
   ∂P
   = ? 1 ? logP + ? = 0

   logP = logQ + ?

   = Q ?
   25
   P =
   ?
   ? + 2
   Q =
   1
   ? + 2
   :
   The channel capacity is then
   C = log
   ? + 2
   ?
   :
   Note how this checks the obvious values in the cases p = 1 and p =
   1
   2 . In the first,
   ? = 1 andC = log3,
   which is correct since the channel is then noiseless with three possible symbols. If p =
   1
   2 ,
   ? = 2 and
   C = log2. Here the second and third symbols cannot be distinguished at all and act together like one
   symbol. The first symbol is used with probability P =
   1
   2
   and the second and third together with probability
   1
   2 . This may be distributed between them in any desired way and still achieve the maximum capacity.

   For intermediate values of p the channel capacity will lie between log2 and log3. The distinction
   between the second and third symbols conveys some information but not as much as in the noiseless case.

   The first symbol is used somewhat more frequently than the other two because of its freedom from noise.

   16. T HE C HANNEL C APACITY IN C ERTAIN S PECIAL C ASES
   If the noise affects successive channel symbols independently it can be described by a set of transition
   probabilities p ij . This is the probability, if symbol i is sent, that j will be received. The maximum channel
   rate is then given by the maximum of
   ? ∑
   i ; j
   P i p ij log ∑
   i
   P i p ij + ∑
   i ; j
   P i p ij logp ij
   where we vary the P i subject to ∑P i = 1. This leads by the method of Lagrange to the equations,
   ∑
   j
   p sj log
   p sj
   ∑ i P i p ij
   = ? s = 1 ; 2 ; : : : :
   Multiplying by P s and summing on s shows that ? = C. Let the inverse of p sj (if it exists) be h st so that
   ∑ s h st p sj
   = ? t j . Then:
   ∑
   s ; j
   h st p sj logp sj ? log ∑
   i
   P i p it = C ∑
   s
   h st :
   Hence:
   ∑
   i
   P i p it = exp
   h
   ? C ∑
   s
   h st + ∑
   s ; j
   h st p sj logp sj
   i
   or,
   P i = ∑
   t
   h it exp
   h
   ? C ∑
   s
   h st + ∑
   s ; j
   h st p sj logp sj
   i
   :
   This is the system of equations for determining the maximizing values of P i , withC to be determined so
   that ∑P i = 1. When this is done C will be the channel capacity, and the P i the proper probabilities for the
   channel symbols to achieve this capacity.

   If each input symbol has the same set of probabilities on the lines emerging from it, and the same is true
   of each output symbol, the capacity can be easily calculated. Examples are shown in Fig. 12. In such a case
   H x ( y ) is independent of the distribution of probabilities on the input symbols, and is given by ?
   ∑p
   i logp i
   where the p i are the values of the transition probabilities from any input symbol. The channel capacity is
   Max
   ? H
   ( y ) ? H x ( y )
   ?
   = MaxH ( y ) + ∑ p i logp i :
   The maximumof H ( y ) is clearly logm wherem is the numberof outputsymbols, since it is possible to make
   them all equally probable by making the input symbols equally probable. The channel capacity is therefore
   C = logm + ∑ p i logp i :

   Suppose the symbols fall into several groups such that the noise never causes a symbol in one group to
   be mistaken for a symbol in another group. Let the capacity for the nth group be C n (in bits per second)
   when we use only the symbols in this group. Then it is easily shown that, for best use of the entire set, the
   total probability P n of all symbols in the nth group should be
   P n =
   2 C n
   ∑2
   C n
   :
   Within a group the probability is distributed just as it would be if these were the only symbols being used.

   17. A N E XAMPLE OF E FFICIENT C ODING
   The following example,althoughsomewhat unrealistic, is a case in which exact matchingto a noisy channel
   is possible. There are two channel symbols, 0 and 1, and the noise affects them in blocks of seven symbols.

   A block of seven is either transmitted without error, or exactly one symbol of the seven is incorrect. These
   eight possibilities are equally likely. We have

   An efficient code, allowing complete correction of errors and transmitting at the rate C, is the following
   (found by a method due to R. Hamming):
   27
   Let a block of seven symbols be X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X 7 . Of these X 3 , X 5 , X 6 and X 7 are message symbols and
   chosen arbitrarily by the source. The other three are redundant and calculated as follows:
   X 4 is chosen to make ? = X 4 + X 5 + X 6 + X 7 even
   X 2 “ “ “ “ ? = X 2 + X 3 + X 6 + X 7 “
   X 1 “ “ “ “ ? = X 1 + X 3 + X 5 + X 7 “
   When a block of seven is received ?; ? and ? are calculated and if even called zero, if odd called one. The
   binary number ? ? ? then gives the subscript of the X i that is incorrect (if 0 there was no error).

   Now suppose we have a choice from n possibilities with commeasurable probabilities p i =

   ∑n
   i
   where
   the n i are integers. We can break down a choice from ∑n i possibilities into a choice from n possibilities
   with probabilities p 1 ; : : : ; p n and then, if the ith was chosen, a choice from n i with equal probabilities. Using
   condition (3) again, we equate the total choice from ∑n i as computed by two methods
   Klog ∑ n i = H ( p 1 ; : : : ; p n ) + K ∑ p i logn i :

   If the p i are incommeasurable, they may be approximated by rationals and the same expression must hold
   by our continuity assumption. Thus the expression holds in general. The choice of coefficient K is a matter
   of convenience and amounts to the choice of a unit of measure.

   T HEOREMS ON E RGODIC S OURCES
   If it is possible to go from any state with P > 0 to any other along a path of probability p > 0, the system is
   ergodic and the strong law of large numbers can be applied. Thus the number of times a given path p ij in
   the network is traversed in a long sequence of length N is about proportional to the probability of being at
   i, say P i , and then choosing this path, P i p ij N. If N is large enough the probability of percentage error ?? in
   this is less than ? so that for all but a set of small probability the actual numbers lie within the limits
   ( P i p ij ? ? ) N :
   Hence nearly all sequences have a probability p given by
   p = ∏ p
   ( P i p ij ?? ) N

   and
   logp

   This proves Theorem 3.

   Theorem 4 follows immediately from this on calculating upper and lower bounds for n ( q ) based on the
   possible range of values of p in Theorem 3.

   In the mixed (not ergodic) case if
   L = ∑ p i L i
   and the entropies of the components are H 1 ? H 2 ? ? ? ? ? H n we have the
   Theorem: Lim

   To prove Theorems 5 and 6 first note that F N is monotonic decreasing because increasing N adds a
   subscript to a conditional entropy. A simple substitution for p B i ( S j ) in the definition of F N shows that
   F N = NG N ? ( N ? 1 ) G N
   ? 1
   and summing this for all N gives G N =
   1
   N
   ∑ F n . Hence G N
   ? F N and G N monotonic decreasing. Also they
   must approach the same limit. By using Theorem 3 we see that Lim

   = H.

   M AXIMIZING THE R ATE FOR A S YSTEM OF C ONSTRAINTS
   Suppose we have a set of constraints on sequences of symbols that is of the finite state type and can be
   represented therefore by a linear graph. Let `
   ( s )
   ij
   be the lengths of the various symbols that can occur in
   passing from state i to state j. What distribution of probabilities P i for the different states and p
   ( s )
   ij
   for
   choosing symbol s in state i and going to state j maximizes the rate of generating information under these
   constraints? The constraints define a discrete channel and the maximum rate must be less than or equal to
   the capacity C of this channel, since if all blocks of large length were equally likely, this rate would result,
   and if possible this would be best. We will show that this rate can be achievedby proper choice of the P i and

   PART III: MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES
   In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are
   continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed heretofore. To a considerable extent the
   continuouscase can be obtainedthrougha limiting processfromthe discrete case by dividingthe continuum
   ofmessagesandsignalsintoa largebutfinite numberofsmall regionsandcalculatingthevariousparameters
   involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as
   limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also
   a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.

   We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with
   the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory
   and would obscure the main thread of the analysis. A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory
   can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and
   discrete cases and manyothers. The occasionallibertiestaken with limiting processesin the presentanalysis
   can be justified in all cases of practical interest.

   18. S ETS AND E NSEMBLES OF F UNCTIONS
   We shall have to deal in the continuous case with sets of functions and ensembles of functions. A set of
   functions, as the name implies, is merely a class or collection of functions, generally of one variable, time.

   It can be specified by giving an explicit representation of the various functions in the set, or implicitly by
   giving a property which functions in the set possess and others do not. Some examples are:
   1. The set of functions:
   f
   ?
   ( t ) = sin ( t + ? ):
   Each particular value of ? determines a particular function in the set.

   2. The set of all functions of time containing no frequencies overW cycles per second.

   3. The set of all functions limited in band to W and in amplitude to A.

   4. The set of all English speech signals as functions of time.

   An ensemble of functions is a set of functions together with a probability measure whereby we may
   determine the probability of a function in the set having certain properties. 1 For example with the set,
   f
   ?
   ( t ) = sin ( t + ? );
   we may give a probability distribution for ? , P (? ) . The set then becomes an ensemble.

   Some further examples of ensembles of functions are:
   1. A finite set of functions f k ( t ) (k = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n) with the probability of f k being p k .

   2. A finite dimensional family of functions
   f (? 1 ; ? 2 ; : : : ; ? n ;t )
   with a probability distribution on the parameters ? i :
   p (? 1 ; : : : ; ? n ):
   For example we could consider the ensemble defined by
   f ( a 1 ; : : : ; a n ; ? 1 ; : : : ; ? n ;t ) =
   n
   ∑
   i = 1
   a i sini (! t + ? i )
   with the amplitudesa i distributednormallyand independently,andthe phases ? i distributed uniformly
   (from 0 to 2 ? ) and independently.

   1 In mathematical terminology the functions belong to a measure space whose total measure is unity.

   32
   3. The ensemble
   f ( a i ; t ) =
   + ∞
   ∑
   n =? ∞
   a n
   sin ? ( 2Wt ? n )
   ? ( 2Wt ? n )
   with the a i normal and independent all with the same standard deviation
   p N. This is a representation
   of “white” noise, band limited to the band from 0 toW cycles per second and with average power N. 2
   4. Let points be distributed on the t axis according to a Poisson distribution. At each selected point the
   function f ( t ) is placed and the different functions added, giving the ensemble
   ∞
   ∑
   k =? ∞
   f ( t + t k )
   where the t k are the points of the Poisson distribution. This ensemble can be considered as a type of
   impulse or shot noise where all the impulses are identical.

   5. Theset ofEnglishspeechfunctionswiththe probabilitymeasuregivenbythe frequencyof occurrence
   in ordinary use.

   An ensemble of functions f
   ?
   ( t ) is stationary if the same ensemble results when all functions are shifted
   any fixed amount in time. The ensemble
   f
   ?
   ( t ) = sin ( t + ? )
   is stationary if ? is distributed uniformly from 0 to 2 ? . If we shift each function by t 1 we obtain
   f
   ?
   ( t + t 1 ) = sin ( t + t 1 + ? )
   = sin ( t + ')
   with ' distributed uniformly from 0 to 2 ? . Each function has changed but the ensemble as a whole is
   invariant under the translation. The other examples given above are also stationary.

   An ensemble is ergodic if it is stationary, and there is no subset of the functions in the set with a
   probability different from 0 and 1 which is stationary. The ensemble
   sin ( t + ? )
   is ergodic. No subset of these functions of probability 6= 0 ; 1 is transformed into itself under all time
   translations. On the other hand the ensemble
   asin ( t + ? )
   with a distributed normally and ? uniform is stationary but not ergodic. The subset of these functions with
   a between 0 and 1 for example is stationary.

   Of the examples given, 3 and 4 are ergodic, and 5 may perhaps be considered so. If an ensemble is
   ergodic we may say roughly that each function in the set is typical of the ensemble. More precisely it is
   known that with an ergodicensemble an average of any statistic over the ensemble is equal (with probability
   1) to an average over the time translations of a particular function of the set. 3 Roughly speaking, each
   function can be expected, as time progresses, to go through, with the proper frequency, all the convolutions
   of any of the functions in the set.

   2 This representation can be used as a definition of band limited white noise. It has certain advantages in that it involves fewer
   limiting operations than do definitions that have been used in the past. The name “white noise,” already firmly entrenched in the
   literature, is perhaps somewhat unfortunate. In optics white light means either any continuous spectrum as contrasted with a point
   spectrum, or a spectrum which is flat with wavelength (which is not the same as a spectrum flat with frequency).

   3 This is the famous ergodic theorem or rather one aspect of this theorem which was proved in somewhat different formulations
   by Birkoff, von Neumann, and Koopman, and subsequently generalized by Wiener, Hopf, Hurewicz and others. The literature on
   ergodic theory is quite extensive and the reader is referred to the papers of these writers for precise and general formulations; e.g.,
   E. Hopf, “Ergodentheorie,” Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete, v. 5; “On Causality Statistics and Probability,” Journal
   of Mathematics and Physics, v. XIII, No. 1, 1934; N. Wiener, “The Ergodic Theorem,” Duke Mathematical Journal, v. 5, 1939.

   33
   Just as we may perform variousoperationson numbersor functionsto obtain new numbersor functions,
   we can perform operations on ensembles to obtain new ensembles. Suppose, for example, we have an
   ensemble of functions f
   ?
   ( t ) and an operator T which gives for each function f
   ?
   ( t ) a resulting function
   g
   ?
   ( t ) :
   g
   ?
   ( t ) = T f
   ?
   ( t ):
   Probabilitymeasureis definedforthe setg
   ?
   ( t ) bymeansofthat forthe set f
   ?
   ( t ) . Theprobabilityofa certain
   subset of the g
   ?
   ( t ) functions is equal to that of the subset of the f
   ?
   ( t ) functions which produce members of
   the given subset of g functions under the operation T. Physically this corresponds to passing the ensemble
   through some device, for example, a filter, a rectifier or a modulator. The output functions of the device
   form the ensemble g
   ?
   ( t ) .

   A device or operator T will be called invariant if shifting the input merely shifts the output, i.e., if
   g
   ?
   ( t ) = T f
   ?
   ( t )
   implies
   g
   ?
   ( t + t 1 ) = T f
   ?
   ( t + t 1 )
   for all f
   ?
   ( t ) and all t 1 . It is easily shown (see Appendix 5 that if T is invariant and the input ensemble is
   stationary then the output ensemble is stationary. Likewise if the input is ergodic the output will also be
   ergodic.

   A filter or a rectifier is invariant under all time translations. The operation of modulation is not since the
   carrier phase gives a certain time structure. However, modulation is invariant under all translations which
   are multiples of the period of the carrier.

   Wiener has pointed out the intimate relation between the invariance of physical devices under time
   translations and Fourier theory. 4 He has shown, in fact, that if a device is linear as well as invariant Fourier
   analysis is then the appropriate mathematical tool for dealing with the problem.

   An ensemble of functions is the appropriate mathematical representation of the messages produced by
   a continuous source (for example, speech), of the signals produced by a transmitter, and of the perturbing
   noise. Communicationtheoryis properlyconcerned,as hasbeenemphasizedbyWiener, notwith operations
   onparticularfunctions,butwith operationsonensemblesoffunctions. A communicationsystem is designed
   not for a particular speech function and still less for a sine wave, but for the ensemble of speech functions.

   19. B AND L IMITED E NSEMBLES OF F UNCTIONS
   If a function of time f ( t ) is limited to the band from 0 to W cycles per second it is completely determined
   by giving its ordinates at a series of discrete points spaced
   1
   2W
   seconds apart in the manner indicated by the
   following result. 5
   Theorem 13: Let f ( t ) contain no frequencies over W . Then
   f ( t ) =
   ∞
   ∑
   ? ∞

   where

   4 Communication theory is heavily indebted to Wiener for much of its basic philosophy and theory. His classic NDRC report,
   The Interpolation, Extrapolation and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series (Wiley, 1949), contains the first clear-cut formulation of
   communication theory as a statistical problem, the study of operations on time series. This work, although chiefly concerned with the
   linear prediction and filtering problem, is an important collateral reference in connection with the present paper. We may also refer
   here to Wiener’s Cybernetics (Wiley, 1948), dealing with the general problems of communication and control.

   5 For a proof of this theorem and further discussion see the author’s paper “Communication in the Presence of Noise” published in
   the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, v. 37, No. 1, Jan., 1949, pp. 10–21.

   34
   In this expansion f ( t ) is represented as a sum of orthogonalfunctions. The coefficients X n of the various
   terms can be considered as coordinates in an infinite dimensional “function space.” In this space each
   function correspondsto precisely one point and each point to one function.

   A function can be considered to be substantially limited to a time T if all the ordinates X n outside this
   interval of time are zero. In this case all but 2TW of the coordinates will be zero. Thus functions limited to
   a bandW and duration T correspond to points in a space of 2TW dimensions.

   A subset of the functions of bandW and duration T corresponds to a region in this space. For example,
   the functionswhose total energyis less than or equalto E correspondto pointsin a 2TW dimensionalsphere
   with radius r =
   p 2WE.

   An ensemble of functions of limited duration and band will be represented by a probability distribution
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) inthecorrespondingndimensionalspace. Iftheensembleisnotlimitedintimewecanconsider
   the 2TW coordinatesin a given interval T to represent substantially the part of the function in the interval T
   and the probability distribution p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) to give the statistical structure of the ensemble for intervals of
   that duration.

   20. E NTROPY OF A C ONTINUOUS D ISTRIBUTION
   The entropy of a discrete set of probabilities p 1 ; : : : ; p n has been defined as:
   H = ? ∑ p i logp i :
   In an analogous manner we define the entropy of a continuous distribution with the density distribution
   function p ( x ) by:
   H = ?
   Z
   ∞
   ? ∞
   p ( x ) logp ( x ) dx :
   With an n dimensional distribution p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) we have
   H = ?
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) logp ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) dx 1 ? ? ? dx n :
   If we have two arguments x and y (which may themselves be multidimensional) the joint and conditional
   entropies of p ( x ; y ) are given by
   H ( x ; y ) = ?
   Z Z
   p ( x ; y ) logp ( x ; y ) dxdy
   and
   H x ( y ) = ?
   Z Z
   p ( x ; y ) log
   p ( x ; y )
   p ( x )
   dxdy
   H y ( x ) = ?
   Z Z
   p ( x ; y ) log
   p ( x ; y )
   p ( y )
   dxdy
   where
   p ( x ) =
   Z
   p ( x ; y ) dy
   p ( y ) =
   Z
   p ( x ; y ) dx :
   The entropies of continuous distributions have most (but not all) of the properties of the discrete case.

   In particular we have the following:
   1. If x is limited to a certain volume v in its space, then H ( x ) is a maximum and equal to logv when p ( x )
   is constant (1 = v) in the volume.

   35
   2. With any two variables x, y we have
   H ( x ; y ) ? H ( x ) + H ( y )
   with equality if (and only if) x and y are independent, i.e., p ( x ; y ) = p ( x ) p ( y ) (apart possibly from a
   set of points of probability zero).

   3. Consider a generalized averaging operation of the following type:
   p
   0
   ( y ) =
   Z
   a ( x ; y ) p ( x ) dx
   with
   Z
   a ( x ; y ) dx =
   Z
   a ( x ; y ) dy = 1 ; a ( x ; y ) ? 0 :
   Then the entropy of the averaged distribution p
   0
   ( y ) is equal to or greater than that of the original
   distribution p ( x ) .

   4. We have
   H ( x ; y ) = H ( x ) + H x ( y ) = H ( y ) + H y ( x )
   and
   H x ( y ) ? H ( y ):
   5. Let p ( x ) bea one-dimensionaldistribution. Theformof p ( x ) givinga maximumentropysubjecttothe
   condition that the standard deviation of x be fixed at ? is Gaussian. To show this we must maximize
   H ( x ) = ?
   Z
   p ( x ) logp ( x ) dx
   with
   ? 2 =
   Z
   p ( x ) x 2 dx and 1 =
   Z
   p ( x ) dx
   as constraints. This requires, by the calculus of variations, maximizing
   Z
   ?
   ? p ( x ) logp ( x ) + ? p ( x ) x 2 + ? p ( x )
   ? dx
   :
   The condition for this is
   ? 1 ? logp ( x ) + ? x 2 + ? = 0
   and consequently (adjusting the constants to satisfy the constraints)
   p ( x ) =
   1
   p 2
   ? ?
   e
   ?( x 2 = 2 ? 2 )
   :
   Similarly in n dimensions, suppose the second order moments of p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) are fixed at A ij :
   A ij =
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   x i x j p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) dx 1 ? ? ? dx n :
   Then the maximum entropy occurs (by a similar calculation) when p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) is the n dimensional
   Gaussian distribution with the second order moments A ij .

   36
   6. The entropy of a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution whose standard deviation is ? is given by
   H ( x ) = log
   p 2
   ? e ? :
   This is calculated as follows:
   p ( x ) =
   1
   p 2
   ? ?
   e
   ?( x 2 = 2 ? 2 )
   ? logp ( x ) = log
   p 2
   ? ? +
   x 2
   2 ? 2
   H ( x ) = ?
   Z
   p ( x ) logp ( x ) dx
   =

   p ( x ) log
   p 2

   Similarly the n dimensional Gaussian distribution with associated quadratic form a ij is given by
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) =

   and the entropy can be calculated as
   H = log ( 2 ? e ) n
   = 2
   j a ij j
   ? 1
   2
   where j a ij j is the determinant whose elements are a ij .

   7. If x is limited to a half line (p ( x ) = 0 for x ? 0) and the first moment of x is fixed at a:
   a =
   Z
   ∞
   0
   p ( x ) xdx ;
   then the maximum entropy occurs when
   p ( x ) =
   1
   a e
   ?( x = a )
   and is equal to logea.

   8. There is one important difference between the continuous and discrete entropies. In the discrete case
   the entropy measures in an absolute way the randomness of the chance variable. In the continuous
   case the measurement is relative to the coordinate system. If we change coordinates the entropy will
   in general change. In fact if we change to coordinates y 1 ? ? ? y n the new entropy is given by
   H ( y ) =
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) J
   ? x

   ?
   logp ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) J
   ? x
   y
   ?
   dy 1 ? ? ? dy n
   where J
   ? x
   y
   ?
   is the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation. On expanding the logarithm and
   changing the variables to x 1 ? ? ? x n , we obtain:
   H ( y ) = H ( x ) ?
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) logJ
   ? x
   y
   ?
   dx 1 : : : dx n :
   37
   Thusthe new entropy is the old entropy less the expectedlogarithmof the Jacobian. In the continuous
   case the entropycan be considereda measure of randomnessrelative to an assumed standard, namely
   the coordinate system chosen with each small volume element dx 1 ? ? ? dx n given equal weight. When
   we change the coordinate system the entropy in the new system measures the randomness when equal
   volume elements dy 1 ? ? ? dy n in the new system are given equal weight.

   In spite of this dependence on the coordinate system the entropy concept is as important in the
   continuous case as the discrete case. This is due to the fact that the derived concepts of information rate
   and channel capacity depend on the difference of two entropies and this difference does not depend
   on the coordinate frame, each of the two terms being changed by the same amount.

   The entropy of a continuous distribution can be negative. The scale of measurements sets an arbitrary
   zerocorrespondingtoauniformdistributionoveraunitvolume. Adistributionwhichismoreconfined
   than this has less entropy and will be negative. The rates and capacities will, however,always be
   nonnegative.

   9. A particular case of changing coordinates is the linear transformation
   y j = ∑
   i
   a ij x i :
   In this case the Jacobian is simply the determinant j a ij j
   ? 1
   and
   H ( y ) = H ( x ) + log j a ij j:
   In the case of a rotation of coordinates (or any measure preserving transformation) J = 1 and H ( y ) =
   H ( x ) .

   21. E NTROPY OF AN E NSEMBLE OF F UNCTIONS
   Consider an ergodic ensemble of functions limited to a certain band of widthW cycles per second. Let
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n )
   be the density distribution function for amplitudes x 1 ; : : : ; x n at n successive sample points. We define the
   entropy of the ensemble per degree of freedom by
   H
   0
   = ? Lim
   n ! ∞
   1
   n
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) logp ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) dx 1 : : : dx n :
   We may also define an entropy H per second by dividing, not by n, but by the time T in seconds for n
   samples. Since n = 2TW, H = 2WH
   0 .

   With white thermal noise p is Gaussian and we have
   H
   0
   = log
   p 2
   ? eN ;
   H = W log2 ? eN :
   For a given average power N, white noise has the maximum possible entropy. This follows from the
   maximizing properties of the Gaussian distribution noted above.

   The entropy for a continuous stochastic process has many properties analogous to that for discrete
   processes. In the discrete case the entropy was related to the logarithm of the probability of long sequences,
   and to the number of reasonably probable sequences of long length. In the continuous case it is related in
   a similar fashion to the logarithm of the probability density for a long series of samples, and the volume of
   reasonably high probability in the function space.

   More precisely, if we assume p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) continuous in all the x i for all n, then for sufficiently large n
   ?
   ?
   ? logp
   n
   ? H
   0
   ?
   ?
   ?
   < ?
   38
   for all choices of ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) apart from a set whose total probability is less than ? , with ? and ? arbitrarily
   small. This follows form the ergodic property if we divide the space into a large number of small cells.

   The relation of H to volume can be stated as follows: Under the same assumptions consider the n
   dimensional space corresponding to p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) . Let V n ( q ) be the smallest volume in this space which
   includes in its interior a total probability q. Then
   Lim
   n ! ∞
   logV n ( q )
   n
   = H
   0
   provided q does not equal 0 or 1.

   Theseresultsshow that forlargen there isa ratherwell-definedvolume(at least in the logarithmicsense)
   of high probability, and that within this volume the probability density is relatively uniform (again in the
   logarithmic sense).

   In the white noise case the distribution function is given by
   p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) =
   1
   ( 2 ? N ) n
   = 2
   exp ?
   1
   2N
   ∑ x 2 i
   :
   Since this depends only on ∑x 2
   i
   the surfaces of equal probability density are spheres and the entire
   distribution has spherical symmetry. The region of high probability is a sphere of radius
   p nN. As n
   ! ∞ the
   probability of being outside a sphere of radius
   p n
   ( N + ?) approaches zero and
   1
   n
   times the logarithm of the
   volume of the sphere approaches log
   p 2
   ? eN.

   In the continuouscase it is convenient to work not with the entropyH of an ensemble but with a derived
   quantity which we will call the entropy power. This is defined as the power in a white noise limited to the
   same band as the original ensemble and having the same entropy. In other words if H
   0
   is the entropy of an
   ensemble its entropy power is
   N 1 =
   1
   2 ? e
   exp2H
   0
   :
   In the geometrical picture this amounts to measuring the high probability volume by the squared radius of a
   sphere having the same volume. Since white noise has the maximum entropy for a given power, the entropy
   power of any noise is less than or equal to its actual power.

   22. E NTROPY L OSS IN L INEAR F ILTERS
   Theorem 14: If an ensemble having an entropy H 1 per degree of freedom in band W is passed through a
   filter with characteristic Y ( f ) the output ensemble has an entropy
   H 2 = H 1 +
   1
   W
   Z
   W
   log j Y ( f )j 2 df :
   Theoperationofthe filter isessentially alinear transformationof coordinates. If we thinkofthe different
   frequency components as the original coordinate system, the new frequency components are merely the old
   ones multiplied by factors. The coordinate transformation matrix is thus essentially diagonalized in terms
   of these coordinates. The Jacobian of the transformation is (for n sine and n cosine components)
   J =
   n
   ∏
   i = 1
   j Y ( f i )j 2
   where the f i are equally spaced through the bandW. This becomes in the limit
   exp
   1
   W
   Z
   W
   log j Y ( f )j 2 df :
   Since J is constant its average value is the same quantity and applyingthe theorem on the change of entropy
   with a change of coordinates, the result follows. We may also phrase it in terms of the entropy power. Thus
   if the entropy power of the first ensemble is N 1 that of the second is
   N 1 exp

   The final entropy power is the initial entropy power multiplied by the geometric mean gain of the filter. If
   the gain is measured in db, then the output entropy power will be increased by the arithmetic mean db gain
   overW.

   In Table I the entropy power loss has been calculated (and also expressed in db) for a number of ideal
   gain characteristics. The impulsive responses of these filters are also given forW = 2 ? , with phase assumed
   to be 0.

   The entropy loss for many other cases can be obtained from these results. For example the entropy
   power factor 1 = e 2 for the first case also applies to any gain characteristic obtain from 1 ? ! by a measure
   preserving transformation of the ! axis. In particular a linearly increasing gain G (! ) = ! , or a “saw tooth”
   characteristic between 0 and 1 have the same entropy loss. The reciprocal gain has the reciprocal factor.

   Thus 1 =! has the factor e 2 . Raising the gain to any power raises the factor to this power.

   23. E NTROPY OF A S UM OF T WO E NSEMBLES
   If we have two ensembles of functions f
   ?
   ( t ) and g
   ?
   ( t ) we can form a new ensemble by “addition.” Suppose
   the first ensemble has the probability density function p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) and the second q ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) . Then the
   40
   density function for the sum is given by the convolution:
   r ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) =
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( y 1 ; : : : ; y n ) q ( x 1 ? y 1 ; : : : ; x n ? y n ) dy 1 ? ? ? dy n :
   Physically this corresponds to adding the noises or signals represented by the original ensembles of
   functions.

   The following result is derived in Appendix 6.

   Theorem 15: Let the average power of two ensembles be N 1 and N 2 and let their entropy powers be N 1
   and N 2 . Then the entropy power of the sum, N 3 , is bounded by
   N 1 + N 2 ? N 3 ? N 1 + N 2 :
   White Gaussian noise has the peculiar property that it can absorb any other noise or signal ensemble
   which may be added to it with a resultant entropy power approximately equal to the sum of the white noise
   power and the signal power (measured from the average signal value, which is normally zero), provided the
   signal power is small, in a certain sense, compared to noise.

   Consider the function space associated with these ensembles having n dimensions. The white noise
   correspondsto the spherical Gaussian distribution in this space. The signal ensemble correspondsto another
   probability distribution, not necessarily Gaussian or spherical. Let the second moments of this distribution
   about its center of gravity be a ij . That is, if p ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) is the density distribution function
   a ij =
   Z
   ? ? ?
   Z
   p ( x i ? ? i )( x j ? ? j ) dx 1 ? ? ? dx n
   where the ? i are the coordinates of the center of gravity. Now a ij is a positive definite quadratic form, and
   we can rotate our coordinate system to align it with the principal directions of this form. a ij is then reduced
   to diagonal form b ii . We require that each b ii be small compared to N, the squared radius of the spherical
   distribution.

   Inthis case the convolutionof the noise andsignal produceapproximatelya Gaussian distributionwhose
   corresponding quadratic form is
   N + b ii :
   The entropy power of this distribution is
   h
   ∏
   ( N + b ii )

   = n
   or approximately
   =

   i 1
   = n
   :
   = N +
   1
   n ∑ b ii
   :
   The last term is the signal power, while the first is the noise power.

   PART IV: THE CONTINUOUS CHANNEL
   24. T HE C APACITY OF A C ONTINUOUS C HANNEL
   In a continuouschannel the input or transmitted signals will be continuousfunctions of time f ( t ) belonging
   to a certain set, and the output or received signals will be perturbed versions of these. We will consider
   only the case where both transmitted and received signals are limited to a certain band W. They can then
   be specified, for a time T, by 2TW numbers, and their statistical structure by finite dimensional distribution
   functions. Thus the statistics of the transmitted signal will be determined by
   P ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = P ( x )
   41
   and those of the noise by the conditional probability distribution
   P x 1
   ;:::; x n
   ( y 1 ; : : : ; y n ) = P x ( y ):
   The rate of transmission of information for a continuous channel is defined in a way analogous to that
   for a discrete channel, namely
   R = H ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   where H ( x ) is the entropy of the input and H y ( x ) the equivocation. The channel capacityC is defined as the
   maximum of R when we vary the input over all possible ensembles. This means that in a finite dimensional
   approximation we must vary P ( x ) = P ( x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) and maximize
   ?
   Z
   P ( x ) logP ( x ) dx +
   ZZ
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( y )
   dxdy :
   This can be written
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy
   using the fact that
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) logP ( x ) dxdy =
   Z
   P ( x ) logP ( x ) dx. The channel capacity is thus expressed as
   follows:
   C = Lim
   T ! ∞ Max
   P ( x )
   1
   T
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy :
   It is obvious in this form that R and C are independent of the coordinate system since the numerator
   and denominator in log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   will be multiplied by the same factors when x and y are transformed in
   any one-to-one way. This integral expression for C is more general than H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) . Properly interpreted
   (see Appendix 7) it will always exist while H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) may assume an indeterminate form ∞ ? ∞ in some
   cases. This occurs, for example, if x is limited to a surface of fewer dimensions than n in its n dimensional
   approximation.

   If the logarithmic base used in computing H ( x ) and H y ( x ) is two then C is the maximum number of
   binary digits that can be sent per second over the channel with arbitrarily small equivocation, just as in
   the discrete case. This can be seen physically by dividing the space of signals into a large number of
   small cells, sufficiently small so that the probability density P x ( y ) of signal x being perturbed to point y is
   substantiallyconstantovera cell (eitherofx or y). Ifthe cells are consideredasdistinct pointsthe situationis
   essentially the same as a discrete channel and the proofs used there will apply. But it is clear physically that
   this quantizing of the volume into individual points cannot in any practical situation alter the final answer
   significantly, providedthe regionsare sufficiently small. Thus the capacity will be the limit of the capacities
   for the discrete subdivisions and this is just the continuous capacity defined above.

   On the mathematical side it can be shown first (see Appendix 7) that ifu is the message, x is the signal,
   y is the received signal (perturbed by noise) and v is the recovered message then
   H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) ? H ( u ) ? H v ( u )
   regardless of what operations are performed on u to obtain x or on y to obtain v. Thus no matter how we
   encode the binary digits to obtain the signal, or how we decode the received signal to recover the message,
   the discrete rate for the binary digits does not exceed the channel capacity we have defined. On the other
   hand, it is possible under very general conditionsto find a coding system for transmitting binarydigits at the
   rateC with as small an equivocation or frequencyof errors as desired. This is true, for example, if, when we
   take a finite dimensional approximating space for the signal functions, P ( x ; y ) is continuous in both x and y
   except at a set of points of probability zero.

   An important special case occurs when the noise is added to the signal and is independent of it (in the
   probability sense). Then P x ( y ) is a function only of the difference n = ( y ? x ) ,
   P x ( y ) = Q ( y ? x )
   42
   and we can assign a definite entropy to the noise (independent of the statistics of the signal), namely the
   entropy of the distribution Q ( n ) . This entropy will be denoted by H ( n ) .

   Theorem 16: Ifthe signal andnoise areindependentand the receivedsignalis the sum ofthe transmitted
   signal and the noise then the rate of transmission is
   R = H ( y ) ? H ( n );
   i.e., the entropy of the received signal less the entropy of the noise. The channel capacity is
   C = Max
   P ( x )
   H ( y ) ? H ( n ):
   We have, since y = x + n:
   H ( x ; y ) = H ( x ; n ):
   Expanding the left side and using the fact that x and n are independent
   H ( y ) + H y ( x ) = H ( x ) + H ( n ):
   Hence
   R = H ( x ) ? H y ( x ) = H ( y ) ? H ( n ):
   Since H ( n ) is independentof P ( x ) , maximizingR requiresmaximizingH ( y ) , the entropy of the received
   signal. If there are certain constraints on the ensemble of transmitted signals, the entropy of the received
   signal must be maximized subject to these constraints.

   25. C HANNEL C APACITY WITH AN A VERAGE P OWER L IMITATION
   A simple application of Theorem 16 is the case when the noise is a white thermal noise and the transmitted
   signals are limited to a certain average power P. Then the received signals have an average power P + N
   where N is the average noise power. The maximum entropy for the received signals occurs when they also
   forma white noiseensemblesince thisis the greatestpossible entropyfora powerP + N and canbe obtained
   by a suitable choice of transmitted signals, namely if they form a white noise ensemble of power P. The
   entropy (per second) of the received ensemble is then
   H ( y ) = W log2 ? e ( P + N );
   and the noise entropy is
   H ( n ) = W log2 ? eN :
   The channel capacity is
   C = H ( y ) ? H ( n ) = W log
   P + N
   N
   :
   Summarizing we have the following:
   Theorem 17: The capacity of a channel of band W perturbed by white thermal noise power N when the
   average transmitter power is limited to P is given by
   C = W log
   P + N
   N
   :
   This means that by sufficiently involved encoding systems we can transmit binary digits at the rate
   W log 2
   P + N
   N
   bits per second, with arbitrarily small frequency of errors. It is not possible to transmit at a
   higher rate by any encoding system without a definite positive frequency of errors.

   To approximate this limiting rate of transmission the transmitted signals must approximate, in statistical
   properties, a white noise. 6 A system which approaches the ideal rate may be described as follows: Let
   6 This and other properties of the white noise case are discussed from the geometrical point of view in “Communication in the
   Presence of Noise,” loc. cit.

   43
   M = 2 s samples of white noise be constructed each of duration T. These are assigned binary numbers from
   0 to M ? 1. At the transmitter the message sequences are broken up into groups of s and for each group
   the corresponding noise sample is transmitted as the signal. At the receiver the M samples are known and
   the actual received signal (perturbed by noise) is compared with each of them. The sample which has the
   least R.M.S. discrepancy from the received signal is chosen as the transmitted signal and the corresponding
   binary number reconstructed. This process amounts to choosing the most probable (a posteriori) signal.

   The number M of noise samples used will depend on the tolerable frequency ? of errors, but for almost all
   selections of samples we have
   Lim
   ?! 0
   Lim
   T ! ∞
   logM (?; T )
   T
   = W log
   P + N
   N
   ;
   so that no matter how small ? is chosen, we can, by taking T sufficiently large, transmit as near as we wish
   to TW log
   P + N
   N
   binary digits in the time T.

   Formulas similar to C = W log
   P + N
   N
   for the white noise case have been developed independently
   by several other writers, although with somewhat different interpretations. We may mention the work of
   N. Wiener, 7 W. G. Tuller, 8 and H. Sullivan in this connection.

   In the case of an arbitrary perturbing noise (not necessarily white thermal noise) it does not appear that
   the maximizing problem involved in determining the channel capacityC can be solved explicitly. However,
   upper and lower bounds can be set forC in terms of the average noise power N the noise entropy power N 1 .

   These bounds are sufficiently close together in most practical cases to furnish a satisfactory solution to the
   problem.

   Theorem 18: The capacity of a channel of band W perturbed by an arbitrary noise is bounded by the
   inequalities
   W log
   P + N 1
   N 1
   ? C ? W log
   P + N
   N 1
   where
   P = average transmitter power
   N = average noise power
   N 1 = entropy power of the noise.

   Here again the average power of the perturbed signals will be P + N. The maximum entropy for this
   power would occur if the received signal were white noise and would be W log2 ? e ( P + N ) . It may not
   be possible to achieve this; i.e., there may not be any ensemble of transmitted signals which, added to the
   perturbingnoise, produce a white thermal noise at the receiver, but at least this sets an upper bound to H ( y ) .

   We have, therefore
   C = MaxH ( y ) ? H ( n )
   ? W log2 ? e ( P + N ) ? Wlog2 ? eN 1 :
   This is the upper limit given in the theorem. The lower limit can be obtained by considering the rate if we
   make the transmitted signal a white noise, of power P. In this case the entropy power of the received signal
   must be at least as great as that of a white noise of power P + N 1 since we have shown in in a previous
   theorem that the entropy power of the sum of two ensembles is greater than or equal to the sum of the
   individual entropy powers. Hence
   MaxH ( y ) ? W log2 ? e ( P + N 1 )

   As P increases, the upper and lower bounds approach each other, so we have as an asymptotic rate
   W log
   P + N

   C = W log

   :
   If the noise is Gaussian but with a spectrum which is not necessarily flat, N 1 is the geometric mean of

   Theorem 19: If we set the capacity for a given transmitter power P equal to
   C = W log
   P + N ? ?
   N 1
   then ? is monotonic decreasing as P increases and approaches 0 as a limit.

   Suppose that for a given power P 1 the channel capacity is
   W log
   P 1 + N ? ? 1
   N 1
   :
   This means that the best signal distribution, say p ( x ) , when added to the noise distribution q ( x ) , gives a
   received distribution r ( y ) whose entropy power is ( P 1 + N ? ? 1 ) . Let us increase the power to P 1 + ? P by
   adding a white noise of power ? P to the signal. The entropy of the received signal is now at least
   H ( y ) = W log2 ? e ( P 1 + N ? ? 1 + ? P )
   by application of the theorem on the minimum entropy power of a sum. Hence, since we can attain the
   H indicated, the entropy of the maximizing distribution must be at least as great and ? must be monotonic
   decreasing. To show that ? ! 0 as P ! ∞ consider a signal which is white noise with a large P. Whatever
   the perturbing noise, the received signal will be approximatelya white noise, if P is sufficiently large, in the
   sense of having an entropy power approaching P + N.

   26. T HE C HANNEL C APACITY WITH A P EAK P OWER L IMITATION
   In some applicationsthe transmitter is limited not by the averagepower outputbut by the peak instantaneous
   power. The problem of calculating the channel capacity is then that of maximizing (by variation of the
   ensemble of transmitted symbols)
   H ( y ) ? H ( n )
   subject to the constraint that all the functions f ( t ) in the ensemble be less than or equal to
   p S, say, for all
   t. A constraint of this type does not work out as well mathematically as the average power limitation. The
   most we have obtained for this case is a lower bound valid for all
   S
   N
   , an “asymptotic” upper bound (valid
   for large
   S
   N
   ) and an asymptotic value ofC for
   S
   N
   small.

   45
   Theorem 20: The channel capacity C for a band W perturbed by white thermal noise of power N is
   bounded by
   C ? W log

   ? e 3
   S

   We wish to maximize the entropy of the received signal. If
   S
   N
   is large this will occur very nearly when
   we maximize the entropy of the transmitted ensemble.

   The asymptotic upper boundis obtained by relaxing the conditionson the ensemble. Let us suppose that
   the poweris limited to S not at everyinstant of time, but only at the sample points. The maximumentropy of
   the transmittedensemble underthese weakened conditionsis certainlygreater than or equal to that underthe
   original conditions. This altered problemcan be solved easily. The maximumentropy occurs if the different
   samples are independentand have a distributionfunction which is constant from ?
   p S to
   +
   p S. The entropy
   can be calculated as
   W log4S :
   The received signal will then have an entropy less than
   W log ( 4S + 2 ? eN )( 1 + ?)
   with ? ! 0 as
   S
   N
   ! ∞ and the channel capacity is obtained by subtracting the entropy of the white noise,
   W log2 ? eN:
   W log ( 4S + 2 ? eN )( 1 + ?) ? Wlog ( 2 ? eN ) = W log
   2
   ? e S
   + N
   N
   ( 1 + ?):
   This is the desired upper bound to the channel capacity.

   To obtain a lower boundconsider the same ensemble of functions. Let these functionsbe passed through
   an ideal filter with a triangular transfer characteristic. The gain is to be unity at frequency 0 and decline
   linearly down to gain 0 at frequency W. We first show that the output functions of the filter have a peak
   power limitation S at all times (not just the sample points). First we note that a pulse
   sin2 ? Wt
   2 ? Wt
   going into
   the filter produces
   1
   2
   sin 2 ? Wt
   (? Wt ) 2
   in the output. This function is never negative. The input function (in the general case) can be thought of as
   the sum of a series of shifted functions
   a sin2
   ? Wt
   2 ? Wt
   wherea,the amplitudeofthe sample,isnotgreaterthan
   p S. Hencethe outputisthesumofshiftedfunctions
   of the non-negativeform above with the same coefficients. These functions being non-negative,the greatest
   positive value for any t is obtained when all the coefficients a have their maximum positive values, i.e.,
   p S.

   In this case the input function was a constant of amplitude
   p S and since the filter has unit gain for D.C., the
   output is the same. Hence the output ensemble has a peak power S.

   46
   The entropy of the output ensemble can be calculated from that of the input ensemble by using the
   theorem dealing with such a situation. The output entropy is equal to the input entropy plus the geometrical
   mean gain of the filter:
   Z
   W

   logG 2 df =
   Z
   W
   0
   log
   ? W
   ? f
   W
   ? 2
   df = ? 2W :
   Hence the output entropy is
   W log4S ? 2W = W log
   4S
   e 2
   and the channel capacity is greater than
   W log
   2
   ? e 3

   :
   We now wish to show that, for small
   S

   (peaksignal powerover averagewhite noise power), the channel
   capacity is approximately

   peak limited to ? S. Furthermore the average power is nearly S and can be made to approach this by taking t
   sufficientlylarge. The entropyof the sum ofthis andthe thermalnoise can be foundby applyingthe theorem
   on the sum of a noise and a small signal. This theorem will apply if
   p t S

   PART V: THE RATE FOR A CONTINUOUS SOURCE
   27. F IDELITY E VALUATION F UNCTIONS
   In the case of a discrete source of information we were able to determine a definite rate of generating
   information,namelythe entropyofthe underlyingstochastic process. With a continuoussource the situation
   is considerably more involved. In the first place a continuously variable quantity can assume an infinite
   number of values and requires, therefore, an infinite number of binary digits for exact specification. This
   means that to transmit the output of a continuous source with exact recovery at the receiving point requires,
   47
   in general, a channel of infinite capacity (in bits per second). Since, ordinarily, channels have a certain
   amount of noise, and therefore a finite capacity, exact transmission is impossible.

   This, however, evades the real issue. Practically, we are not interested in exact transmission when we
   have a continuous source, but only in transmission to within a certain tolerance. The question is, can we
   assign a definite rate to a continuoussource when we require only a certain fidelity of recovery,measured in
   a suitable way. Of course, as the fidelity requirements are increased the rate will increase. It will be shown
   that we can, in very general cases, define such a rate, having the property that it is possible, by properly
   encoding the information, to transmit it over a channel whose capacity is equal to the rate in question, and
   satisfy the fidelity requirements. A channel of smaller capacity is insufficient.

   It is first necessary to give a general mathematical formulation of the idea of fidelity of transmission.

   Consider the set of messages of a long duration, say T seconds. The source is described by giving the
   probabilitydensity, in the associated space, that the source will select the message in question P ( x ) . A given
   communication system is described (from the external point of view) by giving the conditional probability
   P x ( y ) that if message x is producedby the source the recoveredmessage at the receiving point will be y. The
   systemasawhole(includingsourceandtransmissionsystem)isdescribedbytheprobabilityfunctionP ( x ; y )
   of having message x and final output y. If this function is known, the complete characteristics of the system
   from the point of view of fidelity are known. Any evaluation of fidelity must correspond mathematically
   to an operation applied to P ( x ; y ) . This operation must at least have the properties of a simple ordering of
   systems; i.e., it must be possible to say of two systems represented byP 1 ( x ; y ) and P 2 ( x ; y ) that, accordingto
   our fidelity criterion, either (1) the first has higher fidelity, (2) the second has higher fidelity, or (3) they have
   equal fidelity. This means that a criterion of fidelity can be represented by a numerically valued function:
   v
   ? P
   ( x ; y )
   ?
   whose argument ranges over possible probability functions P ( x ; y ) .

   We will now show that under very general and reasonable assumptions the function v
   ? P
   ( x ; y )
   ?
   can be
   written in a seemingly much more specialized form, namely as an average of a function ?( x ; y ) over the set
   of possible values of x and y:
   v
   ? P
   ( x ; y )
   ?
   =
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) dxdy :
   To obtain this we need only assume (1) that the source and system are ergodic so that a very long sample
   will be, with probability nearly 1, typical of the ensemble, and (2) that the evaluation is “reasonable” in the
   sense that it is possible, by observing a typical input and output x 1 and y 1 , to form a tentative evaluation
   on the basis of these samples; and if these samples are increased in duration the tentative evaluation will,
   with probability 1, approach the exact evaluation based on a full knowledge of P ( x ; y ) . Let the tentative
   evaluation be ?( x ; y ) . Then the function ?( x ; y ) approaches(as T ! ∞) a constant for almost all ( x ; y ) which
   are in the high probability region corresponding to the system:
   ?( x ; y ) ! v
   ? P
   ( x ; y )
   ?
   and we may also write
   ?( x ; y ) !
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) dxdy
   since
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) dxdy = 1 :
   This establishes the desired result.

   Thefunction ?( x ; y ) hasthegeneralnatureofa “distance”betweenx andy. 9 It measureshowundesirable
   it is (according to our fidelity criterion) to receive y when x is transmitted. The general result given above
   canbe restatedas follows: Anyreasonableevaluationcanberepresentedas anaverageof a distancefunction
   over the set of messages and recovered messages x and y weighted according to the probability P ( x ; y ) of
   getting the pair in question, provided the duration T of the messages be taken sufficiently large.

   The following are simple examples of evaluation functions:
   9 Itis not a“metric” in the strict sense, however, since ingeneral it does not satisfy either
   ?( x ; y ) = ?( y ; x ) or ?( x ; y ) + ?( y ; z ) ? ?( x ; z ) .

   48
   1. R.M.S. criterion.

   v =
   ? x
   ( t ) ? y ( t )
   ? 2
   :
   In this very commonly used measure of fidelity the distance function ?( x ; y ) is (apart from a constant
   factor) the square of the ordinary Euclidean distance between the points x and y in the associated
   function space.

   2. Frequencyweighted R.M.S. criterion. More generally one can apply different weights to the different
   frequency components before using an R.M.S. measure of fidelity. This is equivalent to passing the
   difference x ( t ) ? y ( t ) through a shaping filter and then determining the average power in the output.

   Thus let
   e ( t ) = x ( t ) ? y ( t )
   and
   f ( t ) =

   appropriate in the case of speech or music transmission. There is, for example, an “intelligibility”
   criterion in which ?( x ; y ) is equal to the relative frequency of incorrectly interpreted words when
   message x ( t ) is received as y ( t ) . Although we cannot give an explicit representationof ?( x ; y ) in these
   cases it could, in principle, be determinedby sufficient experimentation. Some of its propertiesfollow
   from well-knownexperimentalresults in hearing,e.g., the ear is relatively insensitive to phase and the
   sensitivity to amplitude and frequency is roughly logarithmic.

   5. Thediscretecase canbe consideredasa specializationin whichwe havetacitly assumedan evaluation
   based on the frequencyof errors. The function ?( x ; y ) is then defined as the number of symbols in the
   sequence y differing from the corresponding symbols in x divided by the total number of symbols in
   x.

   28. T HE R ATE FOR A S OURCE R ELATIVE TO A F IDELITY E VALUATION
   We are now in a position to define a rate of generating information for a continuous source. We are given
   P ( x ) for the source and an evaluation v determined by a distance function ?( x ; y ) which will be assumed
   continuous in both x and y. With a particular system P ( x ; y ) the quality is measured by
   v =
   Z Z
   ?( x ; y ) P ( x ; y ) dxdy :
   Furthermore the rate of flow of binary digits correspondingto P ( x ; y ) is
   R =
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy :
   We define the rate R 1 of generating information for a given quality v 1 of reproductionto be the minimum of
   R when we keep v fixed at v 1 and vary P x ( y ) . That is:
   R 1 = Min
   P x ( y )
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy
   49
   subject to the constraint:
   v 1 =
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) dxdy :
   This means that we consider, in effect, all the communication systems that might be used and that
   transmit with the required fidelity. The rate of transmission in bits per second is calculated for each one
   and we choose that having the least rate. This latter rate is the rate we assign the source for the fidelity in
   question.

   The justification of this definition lies in the following result:
   Theorem 21: If a source has a rate R 1 for a valuation v 1 it is possible to encode the output of the source
   and transmit it over a channel of capacity C with fidelity as near v 1 as desired provided R 1 ? C . This is not
   possible if R 1 > C .

   The last statement in the theorem follows immediately from the definition of R 1 and previous results. If
   it were not true we could transmit more than C bits per second over a channel of capacity C. The first part
   of the theorem is proved by a method analogous to that used for Theorem 11. We may, in the first place,
   divide the ( x ; y ) space into a large number of small cells and represent the situation as a discrete case. This
   will not change the evaluation function by more than an arbitrarily small amount (when the cells are very
   small) because of the continuity assumed for ?( x ; y ) . Suppose that P 1 ( x ; y ) is the particular system which
   minimizes the rate and gives R 1 . We choose from the high probability y’s a set at random containing
   2
   ( R 1 +?) T
   members where ? ! 0 as T ! ∞. With large T each chosen point will be connected by a high probability
   line (as in Fig. 10) to a set of x’s. A calculation similar to that used in proving Theorem 11 shows that with
   large T almost all x’s are covered by the fans from the chosen y points for almost all choices of the y’s. The
   communication system to be used operates as follows: The selected points are assigned binary numbers.

   When a message x is originated it will (with probability approaching 1 as T ! ∞) lie within at least one
   of the fans. The corresponding binary number is transmitted (or one of them chosen arbitrarily if there are
   several) over the channel by suitable coding means to give a small probability of error. Since R 1 ? C this is
   possible. At the receiving point the corresponding y is reconstructed and used as the recovered message.

   The evaluation v
   0
   1
   for this system can be made arbitrarily close to v 1 by taking T sufficiently large.

   This is due to the fact that for each long sample of message x ( t ) and recovered message y ( t ) the evaluation
   approaches v 1 (with probability 1).

   It is interesting to note that, in this system, the noise in the recovered message is actually produced by a
   kind of general quantizing at the transmitter and not produced by the noise in the channel. It is more or less
   analogous to the quantizing noise in PCM.

   29. T HE C ALCULATION OF R ATES
   The definition of the rate is similar in many respects to the definition of channel capacity. In the former
   R = Min
   P x ( y )
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy
   with P ( x ) and v 1 =
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) dxdy fixed. In the latter
   C = Max
   P ( x )
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy
   with P x ( y ) fixed and possibly one or more other constraints (e.g., an average power limitation) of the form
   K =
   RR
   P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) dxdy.

   A partial solution of the general maximizing problem for determining the rate of a source can be given.

   Using Lagrange’s method we consider
   Z Z
   ?
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   + ? P ( x ; y )?( x ; y ) + ? ( x ) P ( x ; y )
   ?
   dxdy :
   50
   The variational equation (when we take the first variation on P ( x ; y ) ) leads to
   P y ( x ) = B ( x ) e
   ???( x ; y )
   where ? is determined to give the required fidelity and B ( x ) is chosen to satisfy
   Z
   B ( x ) e
   ???( x ; y ) dx
   = 1 :
   This shows that, with best encoding, the conditional probability of a certain cause for various received
   y, P y ( x ) will decline exponentially with the distance function ?( x ; y ) between the x and y in question.

   In the special case where the distance function ?( x ; y ) depends only on the (vector) difference between x
   and y,
   ?( x ; y ) = ?( x ? y )
   we have
   Z
   B ( x ) e
   ???( x ? y ) dx
   = 1 :
   Hence B ( x ) is constant, say ? , and
   P y ( x ) = ? e
   ???( x ? y )
   :
   Unfortunatelythese formalsolutionsaredifficultto evaluatein particularcases andseem to beof little value.

   In fact, the actual calculation of rates has been carried out in only a few very simple cases.

   Ifthedistancefunction ?( x ; y ) isthemeansquarediscrepancybetweenx andy andthemessageensemble
   is white noise, the rate can be determined. In that case we have
   R = Min
   ? H
   ( x ) ? H y ( x )
   ?
   = H ( x ) ? MaxH y ( x )
   with N = ( x ? y ) 2 . But the MaxH y ( x ) occurs when y ? x is a white noise, and is equal toW 1 log2 ? eN where
   W 1 is the bandwidth of the message ensemble. Therefore
   R = W 1 log2 ? eQ ? W 1 log2 ? eN
   = W 1 log
   Q
   N
   where Q is the average message power. This proves the following:
   Theorem 22: The rate for a white noise source of power Q and band W 1 relative to an R.M.S. measure
   of fidelity is
   R = W 1 log
   Q
   N
   where N is the allowed mean square error between original and recovered messages.

   More generally with any message source we can obtain inequalities boundingthe rate relative to a mean
   square error criterion.

   Theorem 23: The rate for any source of band W 1 is bounded by
   W 1 log
   Q 1
   N
   ? R ? W 1 log
   Q
   N
   where Q is the average power of the source, Q 1 its entropy power and N the allowed mean square error.

   The lower bound follows from the fact that the MaxH y ( x ) for a given ( x ? y ) 2 = N occurs in the white
   noise case. The upper bound results if we place points (used in the proofof Theorem21) not in the best way
   but at random in a sphere of radius
   p Q
   ? N.

   APPENDIX 5
   Let S 1 be any measurable subset of the g ensemble, and S 2 the subset of the f ensemble which gives S 1
   under the operation T. Then
   S 1 = TS 2 :

   H
   ? S 1
   = H
   ? TS 2
   = TH
   ? S 2
   since T is invariant and therefore commutes with H
   ? . Hence if m
   [ S ] is the probability measure of the set S
   m [ H
   ? S 1
   ] = m [ TH
   ? S 2

   = m [ S 2 ] = m [ S 1 ]
   where the second equality is by definition of measure in the g space, the third since the f ensemble is
   stationary, and the last by definition of g measure again.

   To prove that the ergodic property is preserved under invariant operations, let S 1 be a subset of the g
   ensemble which is invariant under H

   be the set of all functions f which transform into S 1 . Then

   ? S 1
   = H
   ? TS 2
   = TH
   ? S 2
   = S 1
   so that H
   ? S 2
   is included in S 2 for all ? . Now, since
   m [ H
   ? S 2
   ] = m [ S 1 ]
   this implies
   H
   ? S 2
   = S 2
   for all ? with m [ S 2 ] 6= 0 ; 1. This contradiction shows that S 1 does not exist.

   APPENDIX 6
   The upper bound, N 3 ? N 1 + N 2 , is due to the fact that the maximum possible entropy for a power N 1 + N 2
   occurs when we have a white noise of this power. In this case the entropy power is N 1 + N 2 .

   To obtain the lower bound, suppose we have two distributions in n dimensions p ( x i ) and q ( x i ) with
   entropy powers N 1 and N 2 . What form should p and q have to minimize the entropy power N 3 of their
   convolution r ( x i ) :
   r ( x i ) =
   Z
   p ( y i ) q ( x i ? y i ) dy i :
   The entropy H 3 of r is given by
   H 3 = ?
   Z
   r ( x i ) logr ( x i ) dx i :
   We wish to minimize this subject to the constraints
   H 1 = ?
   Z
   p ( x i ) logp ( x i ) dx i
   H 2 = ?
   Z
   q ( x i ) logq ( x i ) dx i :
   52
   We consider then
   U = ?
   Z
   ? r
   ( x ) logr ( x ) + ? p ( x ) logp ( x ) + ? q ( x ) logq ( x )
   ? dx
   ? U = ?
   Z
   ?
   [ 1 + logr ( x )]? r ( x ) + ?[ 1 + logp ( x )]? p ( x ) + ?[ 1 + logq ( x )]? q ( x )
   ? dx
   :
   If p ( x ) is varied at a particular argument x i = s i , the variation in r ( x ) is
   ? r ( x ) = q ( x i ? s i )
   and
   ? U = ?
   Z
   q ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i ? ? logp ( s i ) = 0
   and similarly when q is varied. Hence the conditions for a minimum are
   Z
   q ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i = ?? logp ( s i )
   Z
   p ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i = ?? logq ( s i ):
   If we multiply the first by p ( s i ) and the second by q ( s i ) and integrate with respect to s i we obtain
   H 3 = ?? H 1
   H 3 = ?? H 2
   or solving for ? and ? and replacing in the equations
   H 1
   Z
   q ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i = ? H 3 logp ( s i )
   H 2
   Z
   p ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i = ? H 3 logq ( s i ):
   Now suppose p ( x i ) and q ( x i ) are normal
   p ( x i ) =
   j A ij j n
   = 2
   ( 2 ? ) n
   = 2
   exp ? 1
   2 ∑ A ij x i x j
   q ( x i ) =
   j B ij j n
   = 2
   ( 2 ? ) n
   = 2
   exp ? 1
   2 ∑ B ij x i x j
   :
   Then r ( x i ) will also be normal with quadratic formC ij . If the inverses of these forms are a ij , b ij , c ij then
   c ij = a ij + b ij :
   We wish to show that these functions satisfy the minimizing conditions if and only if a ij = Kb ij and thus
   give the minimum H 3 under the constraints. First we have
   logr ( x i ) =
   n
   2
   log
   1
   2 ?
   j C ij j ?
   1
   2 ∑ C ij x i x j
   Z
   q ( x i ? s i ) logr ( x i ) dx i =
   n
   2
   log
   1
   2 ?
   j C ij j ?
   1
   2 ∑ C ij s i s j
   ?
   1
   2 ∑ C ij b ij
   :
   This should equal
   H 3
   H 1
   ? n
   2
   log
   1
   2 ?
   j A ij j ?
   1
   2 ∑ A ij s i s j
   ?
   which requires A ij =
   H 1
   H 3 C ij . In this case A ij
   =
   H 1
   H 2
   B ij and both equations reduce to identities.

   APPENDIX 7
   The following will indicate a more general and more rigorousapproach to the central definitions of
   communication theory. Considera probabilitymeasurespace whoseelementsare orderedpairs ( x ; y ) . The variables
   x, y are to be identified as the possible transmitted and received signals of some long duration T. Let us call
   the set of all points whose x belongs to a subset S 1 of x points the strip over S 1 , and similarly the set whose
   y belong to S 2 the strip over S 2 . We divide x and y into a collection of non-overlappingmeasurable subsets
   X i andY i approximate to the rate of transmission R by
   R 1 =
   1
   T
   ∑
   i
   P ( X i ; Y i ) log
   P ( X i ; Y i )
   P ( X i ) P ( Y i )
   where
   P ( X i ) is the probability measure of the strip over X i
   P ( Y i ) is the probability measure of the strip overY i
   P ( X i ; Y i ) is the probability measure of the intersection of the strips :
   A further subdivision can never decrease R 1 . For let X 1 be divided into X 1 = X
   0
   1
   + X
   00
   1
   and let
   P ( Y 1 ) = a P ( X 1 ) = b + c
   P ( X
   0
   1
   ) = b P ( X
   0
   1
   ; Y 1 ) = d
   P ( X
   00
   1
   ) = c P ( X
   00
   1
   ; Y 1 ) = e
   P ( X 1 ; Y 1 ) = d + e :
   Then in the sum we have replaced (for the X 1 , Y 1 intersection)
   ( d + e ) log
   d + e
   a ( b + c )
   by dlog
   d
   ab
   + elog
   e
   ac
   :
   It is easily shown that with the limitation we have on b, c, d, e,
   ? d
   + e
   b + c
   ? d
   + e
   ?
   d d e e
   b d c e
   and consequently the sum is increased. Thus the various possible subdivisions form a directed set, with
   R monotonic increasing with refinement of the subdivision. We may define R unambiguously as the least
   upper bound for R 1 and write it
   R =
   1
   T
   Z Z
   P ( x ; y ) log
   P ( x ; y )
   P ( x ) P ( y )
   dxdy :
   This integral, understood in the above sense, includes both the continuous and discrete cases and of course
   many others which cannot be represented in either form. It is trivial in this formulation that if x and u are
   in one-to-one correspondence, the rate from u to y is equal to that from x to y. If v is any function of y (not
   necessarily with an inverse) then the rate from x to y is greater than or equal to that from x to v since, in
   the calculation of the approximations, the subdivisions of y are essentially a finer subdivision of those for
   v. More generally if y and v are related not functionally but statistically, i.e., we have a probability measure
   space ( y ; v ) , then R ( x ; v ) ? R ( x ; y ) . Thismeans that any operationappliedto the receivedsignal, even though
   it involves statistical elements, does not increase R.

   Another notion which should be defined precisely in an abstract formulation of the theory is that of
   “dimension rate,” that is the average number of dimensions required per second to specify a member of
   an ensemble. In the band limited case 2W numbers per second are sufficient. A general definition can be
   framed as follows. Let f
   ?
   ( t ) be an ensemble of functions and let ? T [ f
   ?
   ( t ); f
   ?
   ( t )] be a metric measuring
   54
   the “distance” from f
   ? to f ? over the time T (for example the R.M.S. discrepancy over this interval.) Let
   N (?; ? ; T ) be the least number of elements f which can be chosen such that all elements of the ensemble
   apart from a set of measure ? are within the distance ? of at least one of those chosen. Thus we are covering
   the space to within ? apart from a set of small measure ? . We define the dimension rate ? for the ensemble
   by the triple limit
   ? = Lim
   ? ! 0
   Lim
   ?! 0
   Lim
   T ! ∞
   logN (?; ? ; T )
   T log ?
   :
   This is a generalization of the measure type definitions of dimension in topology, and agrees with the
   intuitive dimension rate for simple ensembles where the desired result is obvious.
